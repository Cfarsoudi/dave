               FADE IN:

               EXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY

               Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of 
               sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.

               SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020."

               As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.

                                     PHIL
                         T minus ten, nine, eight, start 
                         ignition sequence, five, four, three, 
                         two, one, ignition... Liftoff!

               A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, 
               ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, 
               excited SHOUTS.

               EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON

               DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a 
               gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has 
               got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using 
               an empty longneck as his launching tube.

                                     CHILDREN
                              (all at once)
                         My turn! My turn! No, I was next! 
                         No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can 
                         I do one? I want to do one!

                                     PHIL
                         Guys, guys, please! This is risky 
                         stuff here. And I'm a highly trained 
                         professional.

               Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. 
               There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting 
               poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for 
               silence.

                                     PHIL
                         Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch 
                         another booster...

               Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, 
               is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and 
               Phil catches it.

                                     PHIL
                         ...just as soon as he completes his 
                         fuel intake.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE

               Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin 
               to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in 
               the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. 
               DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their 
               families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out 
               blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of 
               balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, 
               from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed 
               about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE, 
               MARS ONE!!!"

                                     WILLIS
                         It'll take us six months just to get 
                         to Mars. Another year on the surface, 
                         then six months back. That's two 
                         years...

               Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, 
               NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm 
               around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, 
               ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, 
               early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all 
               too well.

                                     WILLIS
                         I guess what I'm trying to say is, 
                         since this is my last night on Earth, 
                         it's gonna be a very precious memory 
                         to me. Y'know?

                                     PRETTY GIRL
                         Nice try, Nick.

               As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and 
               walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his 
               beer, swigs it.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-
               pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has 
               paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI 
               KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as 
               they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily 
               at the chef.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't 
                         be heading back to Earth till ten 
                         days after you guys land at our base 
                         camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty 
                         good long rendezvous.

               WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat 
               over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire 
               pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting 
               this as he smiles at Malik.

                                     WOODY
                         What are you suggesting, Sergei?

                                     KIROV
                         Maybe you should bring a baseball 
                         bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two 
                         crews could have ourselves a little 
                         Solar System Series.

                                     WOODY
                         Please. Half you guys are foreigners. 
                         We'd crush you.

                                     KIROV
                         No, no, we have equal crews. Three 
                         men, one woman. Same handicap.

               He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.

                                     WOODY
                         Easy now, you're talking about my 
                         wife.
                              (seeing her approach)
                         And Terri just happens to be one 
                         helluva shortstop.

               DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of 
               corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive 
               by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss 
               Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. 
               Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.

                                     TERRI
                         Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls 
                         his own strikes. Thousand bucks make 
                         it interesting?

               He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who 
               smiles, nods her cool agreement.

                                     COTE
                         Eh bien. Winner take all.

                                     TERRI
                         Good.
                              (smiles sweetly at 
                              Kirov)
                         Bring some balls.

               The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as 
               Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt 
               grin.

                                     WOODY
                         You wanna know the sad part? 
                         Technically I outrank her. But if we 
                         want any peace at all on Mars Two, 
                         I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, 
                         dears."

               The others laugh.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run 
               by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a 
               picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers 
               of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         ...just not sure how I feel about 
                         NASA allowing couples to go on this 
                         type of mission together.

               One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st 
               Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.

                                     1ST WIFE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Nothing personal, Terri. It's just 
                         that, well, it's kind of a funny 
                         feeling for those of us staying 
                         behind.

                                     TERRI
                              (carefully neutral)
                         All the research shows that marriage 
                         will provide stability on these long 
                         duration trips.

                                     2ND WIFE
                         Then they haven't studied some of 
                         the couples I've known.

               Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really 
               have much in common with these women -- before moving on. 
               ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight 
               tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.

                                     3RD WIFE
                         Anybody seen Jim McConnell?

                                     4TH WIFE
                         I don't think he's coming.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         God, that poor man. How's he doing?

                                     2ND WIFE
                         Totally losing it, from what I hear. 
                         Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her 
                         grave almost every day.
                              (lowers her voice)
                         They say he could lose mission status.

                                     3RD WIFE
                         Oh, that's so sad. That is just so 
                         tragic. You go to a routine physical 
                         one day, and wham.

                                     4TH WIFE
                         After all those years of training, 
                         too. It was their whole dream.

                                     1ST WIFE
                         Must be a pretty funny feeling for 
                         Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna 
                         be in the history books. First man 
                         on Mars...

               She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in 
               agreement, following her glance...

               In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, 
               his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs 
               which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another 
               figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.

               CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 
               30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE 
               GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the 
               restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her 
               approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her 
               with an apologetic smile.

                                     DEBRA
                         He's not coming, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim deserves this, too. All his 
                         friends are here. And it's my last 
                         night.

                                     DEBRA
                              (gently)
                         Your last night with us, too.

               He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his 
               arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.

                                     LUKE
                         I love you, Deb.

                                     DEBRA
                         I love you too, baby. But maybe you 
                         should spend some time with Bobby.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah. I will. Where is he?

                                     DEBRA
                         Up in his fort.

               He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, 
               with a mixture of pride and sadness.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into

               EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON

               Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still 
               shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.

               In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes 
               Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to 
               PRETTY GIRL #2.

                                     WILLIS
                         Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. 
                         But I guess I'll have my memories to 
                         keep me warm...

               Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he 
               reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.

               A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around 
               his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby 
               on a tripod. He looks lonely.

               Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. 
               BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at 
               the sky.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who's gonna read to me now, at 
                         bedtime?

               Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.

                                     LUKE
                         Mommy will.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like when you do it. Now we're 
                         never gonna finish our book.

               His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. 
               Luke is moved. Another brief silence.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll tell you what. I've been 
                         thinking about that. And what I 
                         thought was -- how 'bout if I bring 
                         along my own copy?
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Then every night, wherever I am, 
                         I'll read a little bit more of it. 
                         And I'll know that you and Mommy, 
                         wherever you are, you're reading it 
                         too. That way, it'll feel like we're 
                         still reading it together. 'Cause I 
                         don't know about you, but I'm pretty 
                         anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn 
                         got marooned on that island. What 
                         d'you say?

               Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. 
               Luke is proud of his son's courage.

                                     LUKE
                         Good deal. Can I have a hug?

               Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke 
               fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin 
               young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. 
               Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. 
               They both turn.

               An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.

               Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.

               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON

               The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver 
               climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes 
               out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. 
               The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a 
               moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards 
               the party, then pauses again.

               Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She 
               smiles tentatively.

               JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has 
               dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.

               Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet 
               competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural 
               leader.

               Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They 
               separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.

                                     DEBRA
                         We were afraid you wouldn't come.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I caught a whiff of your barbecue. 
                         After that I was helpless.

                                     DEBRA
                         All the way out in Galveston?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Something like that.
                              (she smiles)
                         It's his night, Deb. I didn't want 
                         to spoil it.

                                     DEBRA
                         Spoil it? He's been going crazy 
                         looking for you.

               Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around 
               Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them 
               so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are 
                         gonna be mighty glad to see you.

               McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and 
               together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards 
               the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

               All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: 
               McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of 
               the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched 
               behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They 
               zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.

               EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT

               The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has 
               torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a 
               napkin blows across the ground.

               In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the 
               waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.

               CLOSER ON THIS TRIO

               As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a 
               moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the 
               sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots 
               mingling with the silver ones.

                                     WOODY
                              (abruptly)
                         I wish we were all going. Together.

               The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even 
               Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.

                                     LUKE
                         Then you've got a short memory. Think 
                         back to how we were by the second 
                         week of lunar training.

                                     WOODY
                         Oh, you're not gonna bring that up 
                         again --

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         I'm trying to remember, let's see, 
                         which one of us scored the lowest 
                         ranking up there?

                                     WOODY
                         You just can't let that go --

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, man, three commanders, on the 
                         same ship? If they sent us off to 
                         Mars together, there wouldn't be 
                         enough fuel to lift all those egos.

                                     WOODY
                              (laughs)
                         Bullshit, we would've made a great 
                         crew.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That was never gonna happen. I was 
                         always teamed with Maggie, and we 
                         were mostly chalkboard jockies. You 
                         know? Systems. Payloads...

                                     LUKE
                         Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time 
                         Magazine!

                                     WOODY
                         Yeah, who landed the crippled Block 
                         II Shuttle?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, and who scored highest on the 
                         lunar rankings?

                                     WOODY
                         Let it go, Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (smiles)
                         Sure, I made a little noise. But 
                         putting the first footprints on Mars? 
                         Nah. That's for guys who...
                              (looks at Luke)
                         ...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how 
                         to colonize the place. And guys who...
                              (looks at Woody)
                         ...read too much science fiction as 
                         a kid and still wear little Flash 
                         Gordon rocketships around their necks.

               He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand 
               away, laughing.

                                     WOODY
                         You read the same damn science fiction 
                         books that I did! You're just not 
                         man enough to wear jewelry!

               He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at 
               McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.

                                     WOODY
                         You want Flash. You know you want 
                         him. Well you'll have to come through 
                         me!

               Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at 
               the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. 
               McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         God, she would've loved to see you 
                         two clowns. Just one more time.

               He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once 
               his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. 
               Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell 
               shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, 
               walking away a few steps.

               Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.

               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT

               McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. 
               McConnell has regained his composure.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time 
                         you donated this thing to a museum?

               Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins.

                                     WOODY
                         Internal combustion, boys. Accept no 
                         substitutes.

               Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell.

                                     WOODY
                         Jim, if there's ever... if there's 
                         anything Terri and I can do --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm okay. Really. Thanks.

               Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand.

                                     WOODY
                         See you when I get to Mars, Luke. 
                         Don't solve all the mysteries of the 
                         universe, okay? Leave a little 
                         something for the next guys.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll see what I can do. Just make 
                         sure you bring some fresh beer.

                                     WOODY
                         You got it.

               With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into 
               gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. 
               Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We 
               sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.

                                     LUKE
                         Should've been your mission, Jim. 
                         Yours and Maggie's.

               McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still.

                                     LUKE
                         None of us ever wanted Mars the way 
                         you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve 
                         years of hoping for this assignment, 
                         training for it --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's all over now.

                                     LUKE
                         If Maggie hadn't gotten sick -- if 
                         you hadn't pulled yourself out of 
                         the rotation to take care of her --

               McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will 
               not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on.

                                     LUKE
                         No, I'm gonna say this. I have to 
                         say it...
                              (pause)
                         I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled 
                         you for it every step of the way. 
                         Never wanted to beat anybody so bad 
                         in my life. But not like this... 
                         Jim, I'd give this all up in a second, 
                         if it would bring Maggie back to us.

               McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust 
               his own voice.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I know that, Luke. You don't have to 
                         say it... Mars is yours now. Go get 
                         it.

                                     LUKE

                         Take care of yourself.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah. You too.

               Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luke 
               walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a 
               moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his 
               door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --

               EXT. NIGHT SKY

               A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars 
               itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant 
               than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

               As we see these thoughts going through him. After a moment 
               he looks down at

               HIS SHOES

               And the sandy verge of the front yard.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite 
               yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE

               And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint 
               in the sandy soil...

               EXT. MARS. CHRYSE PLANITIA. DAY

               Instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning LANDSCAPE, 
               mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A 
               vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders 
               the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin 
               moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky. On the horizon, towering, 
               craggy peaks. And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a 
               small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.

               CLOSER ANGLE as a small, Sojourner-like, multi-wheeled robotic 
               vehicle ambles INTO FRAME, jouncing along the orange Martian 
               soil, pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally 
               interesting rock. Lettering on its side reads "ARES-8."

               SUPER TITLE: "MARS. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. EIGHT MONTHS LATER."

               Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning 
               focus, as it becomes intrigued by something OFFSCREEN -- a 
               higher, more distant target. The little fellow almost quivers 
               with excitement.

               EXT. MARS. TIU VALLIS. DAY

               A one-man ATV ROVER waits in the background, in a dry 
               streambed, as Luke, in an EVA spacesuit, swings a clawed 
               rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face. 
               Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk, 
               he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's). 
               A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely, 
               holding it up to his clear faceplate. He's very happy, 
               absorbed in this work, when his RADIO CRACKLES.

                                     COTE
                         Luke, you read me?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, Renee.

                                     COTE
                         Luke, I just got ARES-8 on line and... 
                         Well, we think you're gonna wanna 
                         see this for yourself.

               Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.

                                     LUKE
                         Copy that.

               As Luke turns away, headed for the rover

               To REVEAL a STAGGERING PROSPECT, seen for the first time: 
               Valles Marineris, that planet-creasing slash. So wide, so 
               deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from New 
               York to L.A.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined 
               Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA 
               jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced 
               gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A 
               VIDEO SCREEN

               We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-
               covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. 
               What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely 
               protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along 
               the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast 
               to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's 
               more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, 
               multi-planed symmetry.

                                     LUKE
                         What the hell is that?

                                     COTE
                         No idea, boss.

                                     LUKE
                         Where is it?

               Cote glances at the others. They're all smirking, as if they 
               share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on.

                                     WILLIS
                         You don't wanna know.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon, what's so funny? Gimme the 
                         coordinates.

               He leans over to read a digital gauge, but Cote covers it 
               with her hand, enjoying the tease.

                                     COTE
                         Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 
                         9 degrees west.

                                     LUKE
                         The Plains of Cydonia. So?
                              (pause)
                         Oh no. You're not telling me --

               They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is 
               incredulous, exasperated.

                                     COTE
                         Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, 
                         he picked today's sector.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific 
                         duty to check that thing out.

               Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. 
               They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without 
               success to coax more resolution.

                                     LUKE
                         Great. That's great. The first anomaly 
                         we hit, and it's gotta be in the one 
                         place guaranteed to make NASA look 
                         ridiculous... You know how many books 
                         have been written about that damned

                         impact craters happen to look like 
                         eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll

                         Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic 
                         upwelling?

                         It's an upwelling, for sure. But 
                         maybe not volcanic...

               The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with 
               growing excitement. He points to the screen.

                                     LUKE
                         Look at the color. And see how shiny 
                         it is? I could swear that's ice...

                         Impossible. You can't have ice at 
                         this latitude. Not unless...

               They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from 
               one to another of them. They're almost trembling.

                                     WILLIS

               They walk over to...

               THE FOUR-MAN ROVER

               The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in 
               pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote 
               and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke 
               puts the rover in drive.

               WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY

               As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking 
               up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the 
               Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna 
               can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, 
               inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL, 
               PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred 
               meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which 
               arrived as a separate, unmanned flight.

               Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN 
               FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY

               A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting 
               majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA

               SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION 
               CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG."

               We MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which 
               is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and 
               insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and 
               Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where 
               Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We 
               hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers.

                         This is a truly anomalous formation. 
                         Looks like nothing we've seen so 
                         far. The structure appears to be 
                         crystalline, at least from the angle 
                         displayed by ARES-8 ...

               On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars 
               One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, 
               finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE.

                         up here, but -- we think there's a 
                         good chance this could be an extrusion 
                         from some subsurface, geothermal 
                         column of water. And if we're right...

               He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries.

                         ...then we've found the key to 
                         permanent human colonization.

               IN THE MMCR

               There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, 
               FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic, 
               epochal discovery.

               MCCONNELL

               Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the 
               Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is 
               brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for

               The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the 
               intense excitement of those around him, stares up at

               THE SCREEN

               Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the 
               excitement their bombshell will create.

                         Anyway, we'are going out to take a 
                         closer look at it, try to get an 
                         idea of its composition.

               The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast TOWARDS

               holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout 
               WHIRRING OUT.

               The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch 
               door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all 
               the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in 
               awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS.

               Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and 
               smooth as if an architect had drawn them. It pierces through 
               the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an 
               isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left 
               to right in front of them.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Walk towards the mountain. There's a very deep, very low, 
               staccato tone intruding over their headsets.

                                     LUKE
                         Anyone else hear that?

                                     COTE
                         Yeah. What is it?

                                     WILLIS
                         Sounds like our antenna's out of 
                         phase.

                                     LUKE
                         Can you fix it?

                                     WILLIS
                         Hey, skip, I can fix anything.

                                     LUKE
                         Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's 
                         break out the radar, see what this 
                         thing's made of.

               As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling 
               tone continues.

               INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY

               MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity 
               of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from 
               the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy 
               head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and 
               just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour. 
               The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, 
               look as excited as schoolkids.

                                     BECK
                         ...and this is the Mars Mission 
                         Control Room, nicknamed "Micker." I 
                         understand a comm packet is incoming 
                         from Mars One Base Camp, so you may 
                         find this interesting.

               He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive 
               array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big 
               screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The 
               NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.

                                     AMBASSADOR
                         That man over there. He's in charge?

               BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO

               MCCONNELL

               Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is 
               giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart, 
               like so many eager bees.

               BECK

               Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.

                                     BECK
                         No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, 
                         the CAPCOM. Our voice link to the 
                         astronauts? Jim's been with the manned 
                         Mars program since its inception. 
                         One of our real pioneers.

                                     AMBASSADOR
                         Will he be going to Mars, too?

                                     BECK
                         Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.

               ON THE SCREEN

               Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing 
               away their dishes and leftovers.

                                     LUKE
                         ...anyway, that's about it. We'll 
                         send another packet when we get back.

               Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can 
               barely conceal their grins.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, right. One more thing. Today is 
                         a very special day for a good friend 
                         of ours, and I know he's there right 
                         now.

               McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What's Luke up to?

                                     LUKE
                         Now, he hates it when any fuss is 
                         made, so I won't mention his name...

               A look of relief comes over McConnell.

                                     LUKE
                         ...because the last thing in the 
                         world I'd ever want to do is embarrass 
                         someone like Jim McConnell.

               McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov 
               appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning 
               candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING 
               "Happy Birthday" to him. Loudly. And very off-key.

                                     LUKE
                         C'mon, you Micker weasels, sing!

               Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of 
               the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of 
               Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified.

                                     LUKE
                              (sings a line, then, 
                              to CAMERA:)
                         Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he 
                         all red with one of those fake "I'm-
                         a-good-sport" grins?

               Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face 
               with a fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin.

                                     LUKE
                         And hey, you guys, check out Ray! 
                         Does he have on one of his "This-
                         wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces?

               Indeed, Beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving.

                                     LUKE
                         Nothing you can do about it, Ray! 
                         We're a hundred million miles away!

               Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the 
               cupcake in a toast.

                                     LUKE
                         Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!

               He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and 
               applaud, then wave goodbye.

                                     LUKE
                         Catch you again soon. Take care, 
                         buddy. End of transmission.

               Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen 
               GOES BLACK.

               Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, 
               as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's 
               fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover. Kirov 
               has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain. 
               Luke turns to Cote.

                                     LUKE
                         Well? What's under there?

                                     COTE
                              (puzzled)
                         Je ne sais pas. I... I think there's 
                         something wrong with the equipment.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     COTE
                         I mean, it can't be right. It says... 
                         it says there's metal under there.

               Luke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the display 
               screen.

                                     COTE
                              (points)
                         There's ten, twelve meters of rubble 
                         and sand, and then... solid metal.

                                     LUKE
                         That doesn't make any sense. You're 
                         reading a vein of ore.

                                     COTE
                              (shakes her head)
                         No. It's under the whole mountain.

               The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.

                                     LUKE
                         Nick, could the problem with the 
                         antenna be interfering?

                                     WILLIS
                         Could be.

                                     LUKE
                              (to Cote and Kirov)
                         Try it closer and up the power. I'll 
                         watch the screen.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as 
               the rest of MMCR looks on. Beck is gone. So are the U. N. 
               ambassadors.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Ah, we're all pretty stoked about 
                         that formation you spotted, Mars 
                         One. The folks in the geology and 
                         hydrology back rooms are going over 
                         your images and comparing them to 
                         every photomap they've got.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain, 
               resetting the radar gun on its tripod. The deep vibrating 
               tone continues.

               Luke is some distance away, by the rover. He looks at Willis, 
               who's still working on the rover's antenna.

                                     LUKE
                         Nick, how we coming on that antenna?

                                     WILLIS
                         Goin' as fast as I can, boss.

               Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on 
               the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis.

                                     KIROV
                         Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I 
                         am. I can't get this to work.

               Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts 
               towards the radar gun.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Medical wants me to remind you that 
                         you're three days late on your blood 
                         tests. I know they're a bore, but 
                         you've got to get them done, or 
                         else... or else I don't know what. 
                         Just do them, okay?

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running.

                                     KIROV
                         All set here, chief.

               Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Crank up the juice and let's 
                         see what's in this sucker.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I think that's about it for business. 
                         But on a personal note, be advised 
                         that, ah, none of you can sing worth 
                         a damn.

               LAUGHTER in the MMCR.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound...

               KIROV

               Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle 
               slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and 
               feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the 
               pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops.

               LUKE

               Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.

                                     LUKE
                         Why did that stop?

               A split-second later, he gets his answer. We hear a WHOOSH, 
               a mighty rushing of wind, as

               A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER

               Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the 
               mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up 
               debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface 
               of the slopes.

               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

               Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of 
               energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too 
               fascinated to even be scared.

               TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV

               We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, 
               perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a 
               skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing 
               at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much 
               dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the 
               accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent 
               outer "skin".

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Exchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes...

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               McConnell still hovers by the microphone.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't 
                         have anything better to do with your 
                         time, I can make some suggestions to 
                         mission medical. There are worse 
                         things than blood tests.

               LAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand 
               and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns.

               SAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE

               As the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is 
               becoming more general across the area. More violent.

               LUKE IS ALARMED

               And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips 
               moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He 
               waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards 
               the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him, 
               retreating.

               Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off 
               the cylinder.

               Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved. In fact 
               he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries 
               over to him, tugs his sleeve.

               WILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA

               But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face 
               with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened 
               gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees

               THE TOP OF THE VORTEX

               Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they're 
               looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks 
               fly into the swirling darkness...

               The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the 
               mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And 
               then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little 
               group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards 
               the rover. But the suction is so great, it's as if they're 
               held back by wires.

               The ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin 
               to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex, 
               the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight 
               train...

               AHEAD OF THEM

               In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out 
               Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their 
               strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast.

               Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes 
               into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her 
               instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately 
               crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...

               LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP

               As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An 
               instant later he sees

               KIROV

               Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying 
               blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream 
               as he vanishes...

               THE GROUND AT LUKE'S FEET

               Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling 
               frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily 
               arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with 
               his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is 
               almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound 
               over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him 
               alive...

               CLOSE ON LUKE

               Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final 
               instant, as...

               HIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS

               Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning 
               and tumbling like a rag doll...

               CLOSE ON WILLIS'S FACE

               His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at 
               him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, 
               and...

               DISTANT ANGLE - LUKE'S POV

               Willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating 
               into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the 
               hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as 
               abruptly...

               STOPS. Vanishes.

               There is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own 
               way as the roaring storm itself had been...

               WIDE ANGLE

               On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, 
               pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away, 
               settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again 
               calm, peaceful.

               And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear 
               another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.

               INT. MMCR. DAY

               As McConnell finishes his message to Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and 
                         Bobby are doing fine. Said to tell 
                         you, they're, ah, they're on their 
                         "third time through the book, page --
                              (glances at a note)
                         -- page 125." They send their love 
                         and say take care of yourself. Same 
                         from us here, buddy. Till next time, 
                         then. End of transmission.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

               MOVING ANGLE, the CAMERA EXPLORING ground zero, as the bass, 
               pulsing rumble continues...

               WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, 
               with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously 
               still with all four wheels...

               WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially 
               crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE, 
               its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we 
               come to the area where the fissure had been, and see

               THE FISSURE HAS BEEN FILLED IN

               Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke. 
               The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see

               EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY

               An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking 
               back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow 
               crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and 
               rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face.

               The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The 
               features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, 
               slopes, ramps. The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind? -- are 
               closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but 
               terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask.

               We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, 
               scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble 
               continues, low and insistent...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MARS TWO (DOCKED). COCKPIT. DAY

               We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its 
               docked position alongside the Space Station.

               Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the 
               cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual.

                                     WOODY
                              (reads)
                         "Problem: Hatch door malfunction, 
                         backup power fail, manual override 
                         fail. Solution: Replace circuit 
                         breaker 907B."

               He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical 
               junction box at one end of the console.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay... Piece of cake.

               He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle 
               of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up 
               beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's 
               seat.

                                     WOODY
                         God, who dreams up these nightmares?

                                     TERRI
                         Don't try to change the subject.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm not! We're talking about your 
                         sister's wedding, right?

                                     TERRI
                         Very funny. We're talking about 
                         dancing lessons. Before my sister's 
                         wedding.

                                     WOODY
                         Honey, do you mind? I've got a 
                         catastrophic power failure here.

               He peers into the housing with exaggerated concern. But 
               Terri's not so easily sidetracked.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, we're a married couple. Would 
                         it kill you to invite me out on the 
                         floor once in awhile?

                                     WOODY
                         I danced with you at our wedding.

                                     TERRI
                         I'm not talking about shuffling your 
                         feet around while you grab my butt. 
                         I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba, 
                         jitterbug --

                                     WOODY
                         Face it, honey, some couples dance, 
                         some go to Mars. That's life.

                                     TERRI
                         I'm serious. We've got two more months 
                         in this training rotation, but just 
                         as soon as we get home, we're starting 
                         lessons. If we never dance, people 
                         will think there's something wrong.

                                     WOODY
                         If they see me dance, they'll know 
                         there's something wrong.

               Reaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker. As he 
               reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation.

                                     TERRI
                         You are such a lug.

               Overhead, an intercom CRACKLES. We hear PHIL.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         Cockpit, this is Control.

                                     TERRI
                         Control, this is Cockpit.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         Uh, Terri, they want us all back in 
                         the Station. Report to Micker.

                                     TERRI
                         Who says report to Micker?

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         The little men who live in my head.

                                     WOODY
                         Phil, c'mon! We just started this 
                         drill.

                                     PHIL
                         Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me 
                         to round up the team. Now.

               Woody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong?

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               A crisis atmosphere prevails. The big room is more crowded 
               than we've ever seen it, with ENGINEERS and MANAGERS hurrying 
               by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering 
               feverishly into microphones.

               On the center screen, a giant image of Mars. A frantic flow 
               of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site 
               of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red.

               WOODY AND HIS CREW

               Are staring up at this screen, appalled. McConnell and Beck 
               stand nearby, briefing them.

                                     BECK
                         Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous 
                         data stream from Mars went silent. 
                         All data -- med, environmental, 
                         everything -- suddenly stopped. While 
                         we were trying to figure out what 
                         the hell went wrong, we got a signal 
                         from the folks at the Large Array at 
                         Soccoro.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At the same moment we lost the data 
                         stream, they picked up an intense 
                         burst of energy from Mars.

                                     WOODY
                         What do you mean, "intense"?

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (hesitates)
                         Catastrophic.

               Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew.

                                     TERRI
                         What about the crew?

                                     BECK
                         The level of energy in the pulse... 
                         didn't seem survivable.

                                     WOODY
                         What about the REMO? It went into 
                         Mars orbit last week. Maybe that 
                         could give us some clue.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Good thinking, Woody. That's just 
                         what we tried next.

               He leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard.

               ON THE CENTER SCREEN

               An orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around Mars, 
               leaving a glowing electronic trail. This dot gets isolated 
               in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer-
               animated image of a small, ugly, industrial-looking unmanned 
               cargo craft, labelled "REMO."

                                     MCCONNELL

                         there was something else. The REMO'S 
                         computer contained an uplink message -- 
                         a very faint, highly distorted 
                         transmission from Mars One Base Camp.

                         words, but we've got a long way to 
                         go.

               Black for a moment, then static. Out of this static comes a 
               faint image of Luke, sitting alone at the Hab kitchen table. 
               He looks awful -- dried blood on his face, bloodshot eyes. 
               The image is blurry, heavily streaked, and most of what he 
               says is lost in waves of static.

               At her desk. TWO CO-WORKERS are trying to comfort her. One

                         Luke must be in pretty bad shape if 
                         he hasn't blasted out of there in 
                         the Earth Return Vehicle. That thing's 
                         designed so even one crew member 
                         could fly it back to Earth.

                         couldn't get home. That energy pulse 
                         would've fried the ERV'S computers.

                         Well, so far our modelling says it 
                         should be in pretty good shape.

                         software to Mars. As fast as we can.

               McConnell looks at him, nods. They're on the same wavelength. 
               But Beck is more cautious.

                         Right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be 
                         working up a mission plan.

                         Luke may already be dead. And even 
                         if he's not, it's doubtful he's going 
                         to be able to transmit again. So we

                         land until you were almost there.

                         through the solar system. It could

                         Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us 
                         Luke hasn't survived and it's not 
                         safe to land, we swing around Mars 
                         and come right back home.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yes. We can design the mission to 
                         have a free return capability. It's 
                         a long trip, but if you don't land 
                         it's the best option.

                         We're getting ahead of ourselves. 
                         You're forgetting the bigger problem.

                         The orbits are all wrong. Our first 
                         decent launch window is almost eight 
                         months from now.

                         But we can go earlier and get there 
                         faster if we reconfigure the payload 
                         for extra fuel. We've modelled that, 
                         Ray. I've modelled it.

                         On paper, yeah. But those stresses 
                         have never been tested in space.

               A tense beat. Again we sense the test of wills between these 
               two tough-minded men, once good friends.

                         I know the protocols for a Mars 
                         Recovery Mission better than anybody, 
                         because I helped design them. And 
                         I'm saying these guys can do it.

               A pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody.

                         0800 tomorrow. Then I'll put it in 
                         the works.

               He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager.

                         Let's get to work.

               McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts 
               out, too, Woody stops him.

                         I couldn't trust him!

               Beck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat.

                                     BECK
                              (his voice softer)
                         Not in a crisis... I'm sorry Woody, 
                         but Jim lost his edge. Are you gonna 
                         stand there and tell me Jim McConnell 
                         is the same man he was two years 
                         ago? You want me to bet four more 
                         lives on that?

               This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press on 
               harder, with even greater intensity.

                                     WOODY
                         When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked 
                         the shit out of him. It knocked the 
                         hell out of all of us. But you know 
                         and I know that he's still the best 
                         we've got. He and Maggie wrote the 
                         book on Mars. He's got more hours in 
                         the sims than the rest of us put 
                         together. Ray, we can do this. Give 
                         me McConnell as co-pilot, and we 
                         will bring Luke home. And that's a 
                         promise.

               Beck looks back at him, his features taunt.

               INT. SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control 
               room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as

               IN THE DISTANCE, FROM THEIR POV

               Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's 
               console. Other personnel have moved away, giving them room. 
               Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening 
               intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly. 
               After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search 
               the room till they find

               WOODY'S FACE

               Woody looks back at him, nods: C'mon, man. Take it.

               MCCONNELL'S OWN FACE

               Is a study in conflicting emotions. But after a moment he 
               masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck. A few more 
               quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand. 
               McConnell hesitates, then shakes it. Both men rise, and 
               McConnell turns again to look towards

               WOODY, TERRI, AND PHIL

               Who react with relief, glad that he's now a part of their 
               crew. Woody grins, giving him a thumb's up.

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE

               As he smiles. Then he starts towards them, with a new energy 
               in his step, a new sense of confidence and purpose. And as 
               he WALKS TOWARDS US, PASSING OUT OF FRAME...

               EXT. DEEP SPACE. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               An infinite canopy of stars. After a moment, some of them 
               begin to be BLOTTED OUT as

               A SPACESHIP

               Glides INTO VIEW. "MARS RECOVERY" (formerly Mars Two) looks 
               much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted 
               above a "tuna can" crew Hab module.

               SUPER TITLE: "MARS RECOVERY. MISSION DAY 172."

               The entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull 
               that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we 
               see window ports spinning past, then an American flag emblem.

               Behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts, 
               like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round 
               PROPELLANT TANKS. Then vast, delicate-looking rectangular 
               SOLAR PANELS, which sweep out to either side of the ship; 
               these also bear the dish of the earth-pointing HI-GAIN 
               ANTENNA. And finally comes the great mass of the ENGINE BELLS, 
               housed within a curving AEROSHELL; three hatches in the 
               aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through 
               for a mid-course burn.

               CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER

               To the forward section of the ship, APPROACHING a viewport 
               in the EVA airlock chamber. Inside, we can see Phil leaning 
               forward, concentrating on some task...

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY. A BUNCH OF M&MS

               Are floating in mid-air, forming an intricate 3D pattern. In 
               the EVA airlock, it's zero G.

               Phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just 
               completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue 
               M&M. He looks bored, sluggish. In the b.g., Terri is hunched 
               over a microscope.

               McConnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming 
               up from the lower Hab, then pushes off from the ladder, 
               floating towards Phil. He grins, admiring Phil's obsessive 
               handiwork.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What's that?

                                     PHIL
                         That... is the exact chemical 
                         composition of my ideal woman.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Used to be.

               He plucks out a couple of the M&Ms as he drifts by.

                                     PHIL
                         Hey!

               McConnell grins, snacking on the M&Ms.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Now what is it?

               Phil looks sadly at his floating model.

                                     PHIL
                         A frog.

               McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the 
               rest of the M&Ms. Swooping at them with both hands.

                                     TERRI
                         I guess now we have our answer to 
                         the effects of long-term 
                         interplanetary travel on the human 
                         mind. The answer is Phil.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (smiles)
                         I'm gonna get an update on SIMA. It 
                         should be just about close enough to 
                         start capturing some surface images.

               He's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts 
               up to the cockpit, atop the Hab.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

               As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the 
               forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor. The 
               cockpit is also zero G.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Hey, Skip.

                                     WOODY
                         Take a look.

               McConnell pulls himself forward.

               ANGLE ON MONITOR

               MARS completely fills the screen. Surface details are clearly 
               visible. Something is moving down there, an amorphous brown 
               swirl.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY

                                     WOODY
                         What do you make of that?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Dust storm. Southern hemisphere, 
                         coming from the east... Big fella, 
                         too.

                                     WOODY
                         Headed for Chryse Planitia.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yup. Could get a little hairy just 
                         about landing time...

               McConnell pulls back from the screen, looks at Woody.

                                     WOODY
                         We'll have to be ready to move fast. 
                         Maybe even advance our ETA. Those 
                         things can cover the whole planet, 
                         and last up to a year.

               A beat. They both hope he's wrong.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         When does SIMA do her fly-by?

                                     WOODY
                         Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's 
                         when we find out whether we came all 
                         this way for nothing.

               They exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is 
               too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (softly)
                         My money's on Luke.

               INT. MARS RECOVERY. EVA AIRLOCK. NEXT MORNING

               CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK

               Just turning over to read "0545."

               TERRI

               Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her 
               redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, 
               looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of 
               blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby 
               is her electron microscope.

               MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB)

               Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed. 
               The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can 
               move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau.

               PHOTO OF A WOMAN

               Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling, 
               dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with 
               intelligence and energy.

               MCCONNELL

               Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546."

               PHIL (LOWER HAB)

               Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a 
               towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances 
               at another digital clock, which reads "0547." Shakes his 
               head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is 
               surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the 
               loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's "Blue Moon."

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. DAY

               Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops 
               himself at a handhold. He grins, charmed by the sight of

               WOODY AND TERRI DANCING

               Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly 
               good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious.

               He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing 
               off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some 
               passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head.

                                     PHIL
                         What brought this on?

                         Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. 
                         Once we're in Mars gravity, it's 
                         back to shuffling my feet and grabbing 
                         her butt.

                                     TERRI
                         I'll take what I can get.

               She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees

               MCCONNELL

               Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A 
               twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes 
               meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: 
               Aren't they something?

               Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, 
               then an announcement.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Attention. Incoming packet.

               They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over to 
               a console, shuts off the music.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's SIMA.

               INT. COCKPIT. DAY. MINUTES LATER

               The crew is gathered around a display screen. The lights are 
               dim, reflecting up off their faces. By their expressions, we 
               can tell the news is not good.

               CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

               It's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars 
               One Base Camp. Ghostly, dust-covered. No signs of life.

                         Looks deserted.

                         It's still standing, though. So is 
                         the ERV. And look, there's the 
                         greenhouse.

                         We know Luke survived for at least a 
                         few hours. Question is, are there 
                         any signs of recent activity?

               They all scan the screen. Phil spots something.

                                     PHIL
                         There.

               He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look. 
               CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

               Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, 
               the image enlarges. THREE LONGISH DIRT PILES appear, some 
               fifty meters from the hab.

                                     PHIL
                         What the hell are those?

               McConnell gets it first.

                         Graves.

               They all realize he's right. They sit back, stunned. But 
               then Phil has another thought.

                                     PHIL
                         Hold on. There's only three. That 
                         means --

                                     TERRI
                         Phil --

                                     PHIL
                         It means Luke must still be --

                         No. It just means there was nobody 
                         left to bury him.

               This quiets everyone for a long moment.

                         Go to the disaster site.

               Phil uses the stylus to bring MORE IMAGES into view. The 
               frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the Face, 
               first in SWIFT BLURS, then slowing. Scattered rock debris 
               come into view. The IMAGE ARRIVES where the mountain was, 
               and they see...

               Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, dropped 
               uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. As 
               if - but this makes no sense -- it had been swirled towards 
               a LARGE CRATER. The crater itself is a perfect circle. They 
               FOCUS on the CENTER OF THE CRATER, but the image gets 
               distorted by STATIC.

               Phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won't clear up.

                         see how an earthquake, six months 
                         ago, could give us this kind of 
                         distortion.

                         That was no quake.

               He leans closer, staring intently.

                         Then what the hell was it?

               McConnell shakes his head. But his every sense is engaged; 
               he's like a predator just sighting his prey for the first 
               time. We see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock 
               this secret.

               Mars Recovery is speeding ever closer to Mars, which now 
               looms large, a dusty red mysterious sphere.

               more, have crowded in behind him, and we sense their great 
               hopefulness and high spirits; the whole team's triumph is 
               tantalizingly close now.

                         We're going to continue analyzing

                         the problem is with those images. 
                         Frankly, we're just as stumped as 
                         you guys, but we'll keep on it.
                              (glancing around)
                         We agree that the evidence of the

                         ground search is advisable. Be aware 
                         there are little sand storms kicking 
                         up near Mars One Base, but the big 
                         one you spotted is turning south. It 
                         shouldn't be a factor.

               Beck takes a breath, smiles.

               hesitating, then feeds it into his computer. Immediately his

               HOME VIDEO OF A PARTY

               An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a 
               semi-darkened living room. The footage is HANDHELD, a bit 
               jerky. People have paper plates of food, beers in hand, 
               everyone is a little tipsy. Debra is there, Terri, Phil, 
               Cote, Kirov, others. They're watching a STILL PHOTO SEQUENCE, 
               shown on a large screen TV, with commentary by Luke and Woody.

               THE FIRST PHOTO

               Is of a small boy (YOUNG MCCONNELL) in his pajamas, kneeling 
               in front of a Christmas tree. He's grinning ecstatically as 
               he holds up a brand new model rocket.

                         Jim's first ship was seriously 
                         underpowered...

               LAUGHTER at this. Some AD LIB CRACKS about the painfully bad 
               haircut and the pajamas.

               THE SECOND PHOTO

               Is of a gawky-looking teenage girl (YOUNG MAGGIE), standing 
               on a porch at night, posing a bit self-consciously by a 
               telescope on its tripod.

                         Maggie was always starstruck...

               More LAUGHTER, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and 
               braces. VIDEOCAMERA swings around the room, REVEALING the 
               adult JIM and MAGGIE. They sit side by side on the hearth, 
               leaning into each other, looking very happy.

                                     MAGGIE
                         I'll get you guys for this.

               More LAUGHTER. Everyone's having a great time. The VIDEOCAMERA 
               swings back towards the TV screen as

               THIRD PHOTO APPEARS

               Jim and Maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a 
               fighter jet. Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand. 
               Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.

                         flight."

               GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers.

                         After that, NASA training was tough. 
                         All Jim could think about was 
                         exploring a heavenly body. More ribald 
                         LAUGHTER, as

               FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS

               Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in 
               space suits.

                         on a short leash. Until...

               A FIFTH PHOTO

               Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT

               As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS, 
               the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not 
               alone. He looks up.

               WOODY

               Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They 
               both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.

               IN THE VIDEO

               Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at 
               the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves 
               his hands, hushing everybody.

                                     LUKE
                         Today we celebrate a new chapter in

                         historic one.

               Both men raise champagne flutes.

                                     WOODY
                         Let's hear it for the newly-announced 
                         Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. 
                         To Jim and Maggie!

               CHEERS at this, repeats of "Jim and Maggie!" Luke grins, 
               giving a little signal, and we see

               A FINAL PHOTO

               Of Maggie in Jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical 
               vacation wear, smiling. Evidently a photo taken in the surf 
               somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a 
               Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image.

                                     LUKE
                         When you guys land, it'll prove once 
                         and for all there's no intelligent 
                         life on Mars.

               More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to 
               protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri 
               sits nearby.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right?

                         started! Somebody put on some music!

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's our sister planet!

                         Oh brother!

               LAUGHTER at this, and Maggie joins in. She's a good sport.

                                     TERRI
                         Maggie, why does this have to be 
                         about us? Mars is a great opportunity 
                         for pure science.

                                     MAGGIE
                         We'll do the science. And we'll do 
                         it very well. That's what we've 
                         trained for. But what if there's 
                         more...? In all our myths, in every 
                         human culture, Mars has always held 
                         a special attraction. What if that 
                         means something? Only we don't 
                         understand it yet...

               The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up 
               in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO 
               CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.

                                     MAGGIE
                         The universe is not chaos. It's 
                         connection. Life reaches out for 
                         life...

               She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.

                                     MAGGIE
                         This is what we were born for, isn't 
                         it? To stand on a new world, and 
                         look beyond it to the next one. It's 
                         who we are.

               A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her 
               passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't 
               meant to get so carried away.

               IN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL

               Reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen. 
               He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.

                                     WOODY
                         You okay?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah. I'm good to go.

               Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being saddened, 
               McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed 
               sense of wonder.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         After all these years... Can you 
                         believe it? Tomorrow we'll be standing 
                         on Mars.

               Woody nods, smiles.

                                     WOODY
                         You know what? She may have been 
                         right.

               McConnell looks at him.

                                     WOODY
                         If that wasn't a quake down there, 
                         then something else caused it. Or 
                         planned it... You're thinking the 
                         same thing.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's never been out of my mind.

                                     WOODY
                         Jesus. You realize what this means?

               McConnell nods. Looks again at Maggie's face on the screen.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         She knew, Woody. She was the only 
                         one of us that ever thought there 
                         might be something down there.

                                     WOODY
                         Yeah, and we're not leaving until we 
                         find out... Deal?

               McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody 
               turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning 
               back. One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to 
               say it until it comes out.

                                     WOODY
                         Maggie was the best of us.

               McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes. 
               McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on 
               the screen.

               INT. COCKPIT. NIGHT

               MARS LOOMS AHEAD OF US.

               As seen through the cockpit windows. Huge, beautiful, MUCH 
               CLOSER now. We can make out swirling pink clouds, large 
               surface features. It's just before Martian dawn, the next 
               morning.

               There's a sudden LOUD, BRITTLE POP from somewhere overhead, 
               and Phil's gloved hand, hovering over a computer screen, is 
               punctured through and through. The screen itself is holed 
               and spiderwebbed with a loud CRACK!

                                     PHIL
                         Uhhh!

               PHIL HOLDS UP HIS HAND

               As he and Terri stare at it, dumbfounded. Thick droplets of 
               blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards 
               the venting puncture in the hull over head. The astronauts' 
               helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.

                         What in God's --

               Suddenly we hear HIGH PITCHED ALARMS SOUNDING, then the 
               PINGING OF MORE TINY MISSILES, slashing across the ship's 
               outer skin.

               WOODY AND MCCONNELL

               Are staring back from the cockpit, reacting in astonishment 
               to Phil's drifting blood and to the alarms. Then Woody 
               suddenly understands.

               ANGLES ON TERRI AND PHIL

               As she seizes his wounded hand, tries to stop the bleeding. 
               He's staring at a gauge.

                                     PHIL

                         Woody, seal the breech!

               ANGLE ON WOODY

               As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the 
               EVA, and floats quickly over to a storage hatch. He yanks 
               this open pulling out a

               PATCH GUN

               Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track

               THE RISING DROPLETS OF BLOOD

               Which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, 
               somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling."

               WOODY PUSHES OFF

               Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a 
               shattered faceplate -- its label reads "MCCONNELL" -- to 
               REVEAL A BREECH IN THE HULL. Jagged metal edges, dangling 
               insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here, 
               going into the vacuum of space.

               Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the 
               puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS, 
               ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then 
               abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail.

                                     WOODY
                         Kill those alarms!

               McConnell punches buttons, MUTING THE ALARMS, and they all 
               strain to listen, faces tense and sweating. A long beat. But 
               the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared. 
               The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon.

               PHIL'S BLOOD DROPLETS

               Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in 
               the zero-G. Then suddenly they start moving again, faster 
               and faster, in a new direction. Down through the open core 
               tunnel that leads to the lower Hab.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Still outgassing in the lower Hab! 
                         There must be another hole down there, 
                         even bigger.

                                     PHIL

                         Positive! A vacuum inside the ship 
                         would cause a total electrical 
                         failure. The nav computers will fry!

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (to Woody)
                         We'll lose all control. We won't be 
                         able to fire the engines to capture 
                         Mars orbit.

               Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punches 
               keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him.

                                     PHIL
                         It's already starting. The primary L-
                         1 hub has been smashed. The systems 
                         are crashing.

               Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more 
               calm than he really feels.

                         I'm going EVA.

               They stare at him, stunned by their immense task.

                                     WOODY

               INT. EVA AIRLOCK. MOMENTS LATER

               Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but 
               something's in the way, chafing his neck. He reaches into 
               his suit, pulls out...

               THE CHAIN

               From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               dangling.

               WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI

               As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time 
               for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his 
               gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards 
               the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock 
               switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look.

               At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential 
               power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on 
               line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful.

                                     PHIL
                         Jesus, it's still bleeding.

               The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody 
               drifts through it into space. He's now wearing the MMU, an 
               oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle 
               astronauts.

               INT. EVA ROOM. NIGHT

               With its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past 
               Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's 
               glove.

               MCCONNELL

               Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim, you've gotta get your spare 
                         helmet from storage.

                         computers on-line?

                         Jim, I've got an idea. If you guys 
                         can save enough atmosphere, I'll 
                         disconnect the power in the main 
                         computer bay, then jump start the 
                         systems. I'll do a hard boot.

               This is a radical, incredibly risky notion. McConnell stares 
               hard at Phil. So does Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Has that ever been tested?

                         Are you kidding? These machines are 
                         much too valuable.

               McConnell looks from Terri to Phil. It's life and death.

               Then he turns, and the CAMERA FOLLOWS MCCONNELL as he pushes 
               away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel, 
               heading towards the

               and pushes himself down a ladder toward the floor. He 
               accelerates as he gets closer to the floor, then rights 
               himself with a twist and lands on his feet -- now in gravity.

               Woody, in the MMU, is hovering over the lower segment of the 
               Hab hull, and right away we see his problem. He can't reach 
               the damaged spot because it's spinning past him, spewing 
               vapor.

               Attitude control thrusters on the hull begin firing in pulses. 
               The rotation of the lower Hab deck immediately starts to

               She catches the drifting can, confused. When McConnell speaks

               Terri shakes out soda from the open can. She and McConnell 
               watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught 
               by escaping oxygen. It rises towards the "ceiling" of the

               Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now 
               being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She 
               can now see the ugly puncture for the first time.

               time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts 
               to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale.

               Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting 
               out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away

               to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, 
               pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in

               As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer 
               bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges 
               are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart,

               by, a meter beneath him. Woody punches his arm controls. 
               Nothing.

               Then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him, 
               the thrusters kick back in. Woody grabs the edge, starts to 
               move to the hole. Woody lets out a breath.

               to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping 
               weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the "ceiling." 
               They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been

                         Jim, there's a lot of scarring... 
                         I'd better check for other punctures 
                         while I'm out here.

                         inside. We've gotta start the 
                         checklist for orbital insertion.

                         Copy, I'm heading there now.

               Woody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he reaches 
               this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily 
               by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.

               SUNRISE OVER MARS

               As the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly 
               glory. It's so close now that individual features can be 
               seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris, 
               and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the 
               Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle.

               WOODY

               Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side 
               of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very 
               long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.

                         Hey, Beautiful...

               Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through 
               the EVA hatch.

               CAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark 
               sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a 
               row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There's a 
               good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower. 
               Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME...

               WE MOVE IN CLOSER

               On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we 
               see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of 
               the eraser at the end of a pencil. So small, so apparently 
               harmless...

               As Woody enters, stripped from the MMU, dripping with sweat, 
               McConnell is waiting for him. For a moment the two men just 
               look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce 
               hug.

               Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up 
               Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat 
               and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.

               Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own 
               eyes. His voice catches for a moment.

                         Try to close your fingers, Phil, 
                         nice and slowly.

               Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains 
               extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this 
               for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

               After a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars

               meterorite. This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks, 
               which slowly drift away from the ship. They're quite

               it down hard.

               EXT. MARS RECOVERY. DAY

               Too late! IN SLOW MOTION, we see a terrifyingly violent chain 
               reaction. The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after 
               another. The supporting metal struts are vaporized. The solar 
               panels are snapped off. Two of the huge engine bells are 
               smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing 
               pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off, PAST CAMERA, like 
               a flaming cannon ball. The entire aft section of the ship, 
               including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded, 
               charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes 
               what's left of the ship -- mainly the EVA chamber and cockpit -- 
               to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars.

               below. Four tiny figures, all alone in space.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

               As Phil looks back, his eyes searching the stars.

                                     TERRI
                         What're you looking for?

                                     PHIL
                              (softly, sadly)
                         Earth.

                                     TERRI
                              (beat)
                         Hey. When we get back? We really 
                         will have to try this in the sim.

               He tries to smile. So does she.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How we doin' on fuel, Woody?

               Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm at fifty percent.
                              (looking down)
                         But I don't see the REMO.

               THEIR POV

               Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black 
               space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them.

               TERRI

               Happens to glance directly below.

                                     TERRI
                         There she is!

               THEIR POV

               The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against 
               the red of Mars.

                                     WOODY
                         Jesus. She's not where I thought 
                         she'd be.

                                     PHIL
                         We're going to miss her.

               WOODY

               Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What do you think?

                                     WOODY
                         We can't catch it. Not like this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (thinking quickly)
                         Use the tether.

               From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out...

               THE TETHER GUN

               About the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner-
               like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We'll only have one, maybe two shots 
                         before she's out of reach.

                                     WOODY
                         It'll be better if I leave you the 
                         gun while I run out to the REMO. 
                         I've got enough fuel left for that.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You'll be going too fast.

                                     WOODY
                         I'll aim to overshoot, then brake 
                         like hell; arc it in.

               McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, 
               and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a 
               switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes, 
               trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands 
               McConnell the gun.

                                     WOODY
                         Seeya in a few.

               McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, 
               loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at 
               full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the 
               tether gun.

               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in 
               an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. 
               Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He 
               checks his armpad display screen.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm 
                         gonna take the edge off.

               Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he 
               can.

               CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS

               Glowing with orange flame. They suddenly cut off.

               WOODY'S EYES

               Show alarm. He checks his display.

                                     WOODY
                         I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long.
                              (beat)
                         Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with 
                         suit jets.

               Woody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He 
               grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes 
               himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets.

               WOODY'S POV

               He's still going very quickly.

               WITH MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               Floating close together. The tether line is still unspooling 
               from the gun. They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as 
               he races towards the REMO. Terri's heart is in her throat.

                                     TERRI
                         Oh Jesus. Jesus...

               McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm.

               BACK ON WOODY

               Still speeding towards the REMO. His suit jets cut out.

                                     WOODY
                         Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make 
                         contact...

               MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               Stare at Woody's distant figure.

               INTERCUT --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At what velocity?

                                     WOODY
                         Impact's gonna be a little rough.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         At what velocity?

                                     WOODY
                              (beat)
                         Thirty-two.

               A look between McConnell and Terri; her face is stricken.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.

                                     WOODY
                         No! You slow me and I'll fall short.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's too fast, Woody.

                                     WOODY
                         No choice. I'll be okay. Here we 
                         go...

               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody's coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers 
               an hour. He holds the hook out in front of him with one hand 
               while grabbing the tether line with the other, and WHAM! -- 
               he crashes into the REMO.

               WOODY'S HAND

               Slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the REMO.

               IT CONNECTS --

               WOODY

               Tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is too 
               much.

               HIS GLOVED HANDS

               Are ripped from the line.

               WOODY

               Slides over the hull of the REMO.

               HIS HANDS

               Grasp in vain for something to grab onto. They drag and bump 
               and then finally his fingers close on... empty space.

               WOODY

               Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.

               BACK ON MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL

               As Terri screams.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody!!

               McConnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel 
               them quickly in towards the REMO.

               WOODY

               Tries his suit jets again -- they're empty.

               HIS POV

               Falling away from the REMO.

               MCCONNELL AND THE OTHERS

               Are being reeled towards the REMO by the tether line. Another 
               couple hundred meters to go.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Woody, what's your status?

               INTERCUTTING --

                                     WOODY
                              (after a beat)
                         Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still 
                         carrying a good deal of velocity.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         As soon as we get hooked up, I'll 
                         come get you.

                                     WOODY
                              (after a beat)
                         Uh, I'd have to say negative on that, 
                         Jim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Negative on the transmission?

                                     WOODY
                         No, I heard you. Negative on the 
                         maneuver. I am not retrievable.

               McConnell and Terri share a quick, anguished look.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, that's not possible. You're 
                         not going that fast.

                                     WOODY
                         It comes down to the amount of fuel, 
                         honey. The suit jets were designed 
                         for attitude control, not travel. 
                         Retrieval just won't work.

                                     PHIL
                         It has to work!

                                     WOODY
                         Hey, believe me, I don't like it any 
                         more than you do.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody --

                                     WOODY
                         Run the numbers, Jim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I am.

               McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display 
               pad. Terri is staring at him. When McConnell's eyes meet 
               hers, they are red-rimmed. Haunted.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Woody, you hang tight. We'll get 
                         into the REMO, fire her up, drop her 
                         into a lower orbit and come scoop 
                         you up.

                                     WOODY
                         Sounds good, Jim.

                                     TERRI
                         It's gonna take half an hour to get 
                         the REMO reoriented! Woody'll be... 
                         He'll be in the atmosphere by then!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Then we'll have to get her moving 
                         faster.

                                     TERRI
                         We don't have time!

                                     WOODY
                         You listen to Jim, honey. It's a 
                         good plan.

                                     TERRI
                         No! We are going to --

                                     PHIL
                         Oh Jesus, look! The ship!

               Phil points. McConnell and Terri look.

               THE MARS RECOVERY COCKPIT

               Is now several kilometers below and behind them. It's glowing 
               red... then orange... then white. Then it erupts into a giant 
               fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere.

               MCCONNELL, TERRI AND PHIL IN DEEP SPACE

               Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to 
               look up again. He sees something alarming.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Look out!

               THEIR POV

               They are drifting quickly into the REMO.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Brakes!

               ALL THREE

               Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang 
               into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They 
               find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the 
               tether gun.

               THE HOOK

               Releases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button 
               and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already 
               scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start 
                         dumping the cargo, or there won't be 
                         room for us.

                                     PHIL
                         But we need those supplies for --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!

               WOODY

               Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that 
               Terri has reached it safely.

                                     WOODY
                         Will do, Jim.

               He turns to look at...

               MARS

               Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.

                                     WOODY
                              (softly)
                         Hey, Beautiful...

               BACK AT THE REMO

               Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from 
               McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the REMO. 
               McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, no!

               But it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires 
               her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO.

               MCCONNELL

               Is reaching to activate his own jets, when

               PHIL'S HAND

               Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They 
               stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half-
               maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Goddammit, Terri, it won't work!

               But Terri keeps on going.

               WOODY

               Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars. 
               Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri, what are you doing?

               INTERCUT --

                                     TERRI
                         I'll tell you what I'm not doing, 
                         Woody. I'm not going to watch you 
                         die.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri --

                                     TERRI
                         You'd do the same for me.

               AT THE REMO

               Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle 
               of Woody's suit lights. The airlock door hangs open. Phil 
               looks at McConnell, anguished.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Get inside. Dump the cargo, then 
                         start the systems.
                              (Phil hesitates)
                         Now.

               INTERCUTTING BETWEEN WOODY AND TERRI

               As Woody keys his mike. Tries to steady his voice.

                                     WOODY
                         No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if 
                         it just wasn't possible.

                                     TERRI
                         I can do it!

                                     WOODY
                         No, Terri, you can't! You don't have 
                         enough fuel to get me, stop us both, 
                         and get us back. Hell, you come any 
                         farther and you won't have enough to 
                         get back yourself.

               No response from Terri.

                                     WOODY
                         Listen to me, goddammit! You have to 
                         stop! You have to stop now!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He's right, Terri... It's no use.

               Terri looks at her armpad display.

               CLOSE ON DISPLAY SCREEN

               As her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to...

               TERRI

               Releases her thumb from the toggle control.

               HER SUIT JETS

               Stop firing.

               TERRI

               Drifts, staring towards Woody.

               TERRI AND WOODY

               Are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only 
               about a hundred meters apart. But it might as well be 
               infinity.

                                     WOODY
                         Okay, honey...? You gotta go back 
                         now.

                                     TERRI
                         The hell I do.

               Terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger.

               THE HOOK

               Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.

               WOODY

               Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.

               PLATE POV -- MOVING -- AS

               Woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer, 
               and then SNAP! -- the hook stops. ANGLE ON THE TETHER GUN

               The wire has run all the way out.

               WOODY

               Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from 
               him. His only life preserver.

               TERRI

               Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into 
               the gun.

                                     WOODY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TERRI
                         I'm gonna jet a little closer and 
                         try again.

                                     WOODY
                         Terri, you spend any fuel getting 
                         closer, you won't get back, and if 
                         anyone tries to get you, they'll die 
                         too.

               No response from Terri.

               THE HOOK

               Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun. Woody's voice 
               cracks; he's very close to tears. Pleading now.

                                     WOODY
                         Honey, please go back. Go back and 
                         help everyone get down to the surface.

               The hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun. Terri 
               resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury.

                                     TERRI
                         I am not losing you.

                                     WOODY
                         I can't let you do it. I can't. I'm 
                         sorry.

               TERRI

               Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something 
               different in his voice now, a terrible resolve...

                                     TERRI
                         Woody...?

               WOODY

               Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.

                                     WOODY
                         I love you, Terri. God how I love 
                         you.

               He unscrews the ring, pops the seal. The outrush of air pushes 
               his helmet all the way off. Woody shuts his eyes and opens 
               his mouth.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, nooooooo...!!!

               Ice crystals bloom with Woody's last breath. There's nothing 
               to suck in. He doesn't fight it. He lets death come.

               ANGLE ON TERRI

               Tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic.

                                     TERRI
                         Woody, oh Woody, please God, no!

               HER THUMB

               Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice, 
               from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty 
               years in the blink of an eye.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Come back, Terri.

               Terri's thumb is still poised. Death would be better.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL

               Outside the REMO. The hatch is still open. We see Phil inside, 
               staring out anxiously towards Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (quietly, simply)
                         He's gone.

               He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Please, Terri...
                              (long beat)
                         We need you.

               TERRI'S THUMB

               Pushes the toggle control... to one side, not forward.

               TERRI'S FACE

               Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself 
               around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO.

               INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MMCR. DAY

               On the big screen at MMCR, a glowing green icon labelled 
               "MARS RECOVERY" is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer 
               figures crawls beside it.

               SUPER TITLE: "SPACE STATION. MMCR. 20 MINUTE TIME LAG"

               Beck stands by the NEW CAPCOM, as the latter repeats headset 
               data.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         Okay, they're Go for the burn and 
                         MOI. Should be initiating the burn 
                         just about... now.

               Suddenly the data stream goes crazy. It shivers, streaks, 
               breaks up... then stops. The blinking green icon representing 
               Mars Recovery glows brighter... then vanishes.

               A moment of stunned silence in the big room. Then a rising 
               babble of scared, confused voices.

               RAY BECK

               Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His 
               face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place, 
               right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a 
               row...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, 
               packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. 
               The hatch is sealed.

               INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by 
               the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome 
               his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate 
               on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has 
               been opened; he's facing

               SMALL UTILITY MONITOR

               Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator 
               lights, com ports.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a 
               palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins 
               tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He 
               turns, looking back at

               TERRI AND PHIL

               Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. 
               They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this 
               tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned 
               operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.

               PHIL'S FACE

               Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and 
               fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer 
               supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.

               TERRI

               Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.

               MCCONNELL

               Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil?
                              (no response)
                         Hey, Phil...?

               Phil looks up at him dully.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're going in blind. We'll deploy 
                         the chutes by laptop. I need to get 
                         on the data bus, put in a software 
                         patch, and try to soften this tin 
                         can's landing. I could use your help 
                         with the patch.

               After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards 
               McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, 
               then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to 
               tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's great. Good job.
                              (turning to Terri)
                         Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think 
                         maybe we could rig some kind of 
                         seatbelts out of those cargo straps?

               Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her 
               hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches 
               for another one, begins looping them together.

               MCCONNELL

               Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't 
               push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, 
               but at least they're moving.

               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT. (MINUTES LATER)

               Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position 
               for entry into the atmosphere.

               Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it 
               falls away from us, towards Mars at night.

               INT. REMO. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT

               The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri's jury-rigged 
               strap system, hold on for dear life. The buffeting through 
               the atmosphere is shaking them violently.

               BEHIND THEIR FACEPLATES

               We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted, 
               unable to focus their eyes. Each of them thinking, once again: 
               Now I'm going to die...

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

               The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some 
               desolate, otherwordly ghost town. And then, in the night sky 
               beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright 
               streak of red as the REMO slashes down into the Martian 
               atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind 
               distant mountains. Then all is stillness again, deathly 
               stillness and silence...

               INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. VIEWPORT. DAY

               Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. He's just 
               lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this 
               disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the 
               certain end of his own career. He doesn't, at first, even 
               hear the nearby VOICE.

                         just coming in.

               Beck looks up, his eyes red-rimmed. The CapCom shifts 
               uneasily. He's holding a computer printout.

                                     NEW CAPCOM
                         We just -- it doesn't make any sense. 
                         We're not sure how to read this.

                                     BECK
                         Data?

                         Yes sir. Telemetry reports the REMO 
                         has left its orbit and reached the 
                         Martian surface.

                                     BECK
                              (pause)
                         Crashed?

                         No sir. Under power.

               Beck snatches the paper, staring at it. For the first time 
               we see some life coming back into him.

                                     BECK
                         When?

                         graph reads like a controlled descent. 
                         But that doesn't make any --

               Beck suddenly understands. And it's a joy to see his face, 
               the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes.

                                     BECK
                         They used the REMO as a lander.

               The CapCom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of 
               hope.

                                     BECK
                         It's McConnell, it's got to be! Nobody 
                         else could have pulled this off. Son 
                         of a bitch! They're alive.

               EXT. MARTIAN SURFACE. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

               POV ANGLE - WIDE

               As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the 
               distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff, 
               the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.

               PANNING

               We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well 
               as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, 
               and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant 
               are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by 
               micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze. 
               And finally,

               CLOSER TO CAMERA

               We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole, 
               but nearly obliterated by sand.

               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL

               Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the 
               edge of the camp.

               They have dragged along with them from their landing site a 
               crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and 
               some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.

               McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep 
               their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing 
               off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the 
               ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a 
               moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost, 
               they have made it to Mars.

               When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Better?

                                     PHIL
                              (pause)
                         Damn right.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, let's see if that oxygen still 
                         is operational. Phil, you better 
                         check out the ERV. I'll take the 
                         Hab. If you find Luke's --

               He catches himself. Phil and Terri look at him.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Just keep in touch.

               EXT. ERV. DAY

               Phil steps from the umber sand onto the ERV's ladder, begins 
               to climb. The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high 
               against its tires.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri kneels by the oxygen still, begins to scoop away sand 
               with her gloved hands. She still looks numb.

               EXT. HAB. DAY

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (on radio)
                         I'm at the main airlock door.

               He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs 
               it. After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks 
               open. Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Entering Hab.

               EXT. ERV. DAY

               Perched atop the ERV's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered 
               drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover. 
               He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand.

                                     PHIL
                         I've got ERV access. I'm going in. 
                         Terri, you okay?

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri is still scooping sand. She's just cleared the first 
               row of gauges.

                                     TERRI
                         Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to 
                         get back to 100% capacity.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize. He 
               pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew 
               taped their final, fateful message.

               HIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE

               Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. 
               Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the 
               corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins, 
               startled, and sees

               HIS OWN REFLECTION.

               In his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the 
               screen of a video monitor. Above this is perched the camera 
               the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets.

               MCCONNELL SHIVERS

               This place is filled with ghosts.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil, in the pilot's seat of the ERV, pushes a computer's 
               power button. The screen flickers weakly to life, startling 
               him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy 
               static.

                                     PHIL
                         ERV appears structurally intact. 
                         Computers are fried, just as we 
                         thought.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri has cleared more gauges, valves. She sits back on her 
               heels, studying the tangle of pipes.

                                     TERRI
                         Copy that. I've got busted filters 
                         here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup 
                         job, but so far no major damage.

               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               AN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS. 
               THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV

               On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants 
               have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are 
               even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on 
               the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through 
               pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever 
               assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.

               MCCONNELL

               Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up 
               before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, 
               he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.

               Blinking red letters read "25 deg. C." And something else -- 
               the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly 
               deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in 
               here!

               MCCONNELL

               Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:

               "Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%."

               MCCONNELL

               Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He 
               hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful 
               of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment 
               he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards 
               his helmet.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm in the greenhouse. You better... 
                         you better come see this for 
                         yourselves.

               INT. ERV. DAY

               Phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. Through 
               a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse.

                                     PHIL
                         What is it?

               There's no answer. He rises.

               EXT. OXYGEN STILL. DAY

               Terri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant, 
               translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure 
               can be seen, moving slowly.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim...?

               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing 
               through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping 
               foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he 
               looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, 
               jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has 
               come into play. He pauses, looking up...

               Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic 
               tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in 
               the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water 
               wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with 
               duct tape, like some giant Erector set.

               As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged 
               figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with 
               a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.

               McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights 
               back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as 
               he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a 
               glimpse of the almost unrecognizable

               LUKE GRAHAM

               Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying 
               curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above 
               a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. 
               In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high 
               overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. 
               McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell!

               We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks 
               his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles 
               in the air.

                                     LUKE
                         You're not here!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, it's Jim!

                                     LUKE
                         No, no, you're not... you can't be 
                         here.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby! 
                         You were reading Treasure Island 
                         with him...!

               As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up 
               with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from 
               behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped 
               from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell 
               scrambles to his feet.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Don't hurt him!

               McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil 
               that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off 
               their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.

               Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after 
               another, as if still not quite certain whether they might 
               vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.

                                     LUKE
                         Phil... Terri...

               Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim... I don't understand. You're 
                         not supposed to be here... Why are 
                         you here? Where's Woody?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He didn't make it Luke.

               Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He 
               looks to Terri, who looks down.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh no.

               Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on 
               himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell 
               kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.

               Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented 
               sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse. 
               Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested 
               vegetables and greens. The others crouch around him.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, what happened here?

               A flash of fear in Luke's eyes.

                                     LUKE
                              (whispers)
                         We fired the radar. It came. They 
                         all died.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What came?

                                     LUKE
                         They all died, but I was spared. 
                         Why? Had to be for a reason. Then, 
                         all of a sudden, I knew why I was 
                         spared.

               His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper.

                                     LUKE
                         So somebody would be left to figure 
                         out the secret.

               He taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice. 
               The others exchange an uneasy glance.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, we still don't understand.

                                     LUKE
                         Come. Comecomecome.

               He rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand, 
               without waiting to see if they'll follow. McConnell, Terri 
               and Phil stare after him for a long moment. Phil breaks the 
               silence.

                                     PHIL
                         Is it just me? Or is he about two 
                         mealpacks short of a picnic?

                                     TERRI
                         Long term exposure to low gravity 
                         can have an adverse impact on the 
                         brain. He could be suffering from a 
                         form of asphyxia.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Or maybe his whole crew died and 
                         he's been marooned alone on Mars. 
                         Let's give him time to adjust.

               McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Phil, 
               trailing, mutters to himself.

                                     PHIL
                         Greatgreatgreat.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY

               Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking 
               helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised 
               sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil 
               walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear 
               Luke over his RADIO.

                                     LUKE
                         So... let me be sure I understand 
                         this. Your ship blew up, with all 
                         its supplies. Then you emptied the 
                         cargo out of the REMO, and it was 
                         totalled on landing. You've got no 
                         food, no water, no spare oxygen, 
                         nothing but what I see here...?

               McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then 
               McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.

                                     LUKE
                         What kinda rescue mission is this?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That kind.

               He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off 
               a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         Check it out. New nav boards for the 
                         ERV. I got four round-trip tickets, 
                         baby, right in here.

                                     LUKE
                              (softly)
                         Four.

               In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death seems 
               to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by the 
               shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze.

                                     LUKE
                         Terri... I'm so sorry. He was a good 
                         man.

                                     TERRI
                         Thanks, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         When there's time, we'll talk.

               She nods, grateful. A beat. He looks at the others.

                                     LUKE
                         This way.

               He starts off across the sand, and they follow.

               EXT. GRAVE SITE. DAY

               They stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as 
               Luke completes his account of the disaster.

                                     LUKE
                         ...When I came to and dug myself out 
                         of the sand, my faceplate was cracked. 
                         Leaking badly. I barely made it back 
                         to Base. It was weeks before I could 
                         work up the nerve to go back out 
                         there and look for their...

               He has to pause, collect himself.

                                     LUKE
                         Renee was the only one I could find. 
                         But it didn't seem right, somehow, 
                         to dig just one grave.

               There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few steps. 
               He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust 
               around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Has it been blowing like this for a 
                         while?
                              (Luke nods)
                         We saw a big storm from space. But 
                         Micker said it was turning south.

               Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he 
               seems to see.

                                     LUKE
                         If it holds course.

               McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at 
               Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         This -- whatever it was -- this force. 
                         You say it came directly out of the 
                         top of the mountain?

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe me. That's okay. 
                         But I'm not crazy, Jim.

               McConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What did you mean by its "secret?" 
                         What secret?

                                     LUKE
                              (pause)
                         You better see for yourselves.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab 
               area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks. Their helmets 
               are off. It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty.

               THEIR POV --

               The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many 
               locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and 
               diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated 
               maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of 
               the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.

                                     LUKE
                         See, where they made their mistake 
                         was, they must've planned for it to 
                         be visible from Earth...

               The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electric 
               space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he rubs 
               his hands together, poised over the keyboard.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Who's "they"?

               Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jittery 
               feverish intensity, a secret excitement.

                                     LUKE
                         Don't you understand? Hundreds of 
                         millions of years have gone by. You've 
                         got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, 
                         meteor impacts -- hell, in that much 
                         time, the whole surface would've 
                         changed. So no wonder we never saw 
                         it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, 
                         but not like they meant us too. Too 
                         much dirt on it.

               The others exchange worried glances. Is he totally nuts?

                                     TERRI
                         Saw what?

                                     LUKE
                         This.

               On the computer screen they're looking at...

               CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

               Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground-
               level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and 
               dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face. 
               The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a 
               mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural.

               MCCONNELL, PHIL AND TERRI (INT. MARS ONE HAB.)

               They are stunned. Can hardly believe their eyes.

                                     PHIL
                         Jesus...

                                     TERRI
                         What is that...?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know. But whatever it is, 
                         somebody built it. And not us.

               A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What about the sound? That signal 
                         you heard before the explosion?

                                     LUKE
                         Good, Jim, good. That's the key.

               A click of the mouse and they all HEAR, over speakers, the 
               DEEP PULSING BASS TONE.

                                     LUKE
                         Hear the pauses? That's what made me 
                         realize it's a pattern -- a repeating 
                         pattern.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Mathematical?

               Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very 
               quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.

                                     LUKE
                         That's what I thought. There are 
                         distinct blocks in the pattern, and 
                         within each block the tones come in 
                         groups of three. Threethreethree. 
                         For months I struggled to analyze 
                         it, trying different constructs... 
                         Then I thought about dimensions.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         X-Y-Z coordinates...

                                     LUKE
                         Right! Three groups equals three 
                         dimensions... So I tried assigning 
                         different graphic values to each 
                         block, group and tone. And finally I 
                         got... this.

               He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the 
               glow reflecting on their faces. They are amazed again.

               CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

               Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally 
               familiar double helix, of a DNA molecule -- the elegant 
               blueprint of life.

                                     PHIL
                         My God... Is that what I think it 
                         is?

                                     TERRI
                         DNA... that's a model of DNA!

                         You see it, too. Thank God. I was 
                         afraid I was just suffering from a 
                         form of asphyxia.

               She glances at him, surprised that he overheard her earlier 
               diagnosis. But he smiles, not offended.

                                     PHIL
                         So, okay, so -- somebody left this 
                         thing here, somebody -- other than 
                         human. But what the hell is it?

                                     LUKE
                         My guess is, it's a signature. A 
                         self-portrait of whatever species 
                         created the Face.

                         But that DNA looks human.

                                     TERRI
                         No way. It's missing the last pair 
                         of chromosomes. See?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah, but it's close. Damn close.

                                     TERRI
                         The difference between a man and an 
                         ape is less than three percent of 
                         genetic material. But that three 
                         percent gives you Mozart. Einstein.

                                     PHIL
                         Or Jack the Ripper.

               They look at him. Then all four turn, stare again at the 
               slowly rotating DNA, pondering its awesome mystery.

               MCCONNELL

               When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen. 
               We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery 
               has on his imagination.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's been a long day. Let's get a 
                         couple hours sleep, then tackle this 
                         thing when we're fresher. Phil, your 
                         first priority will be to get the 
                         motherboards over to the ERV. 
                         Concentrate on getting communications 
                         up first.
                              (Phil nods)
                         Soon as we've got the juice, we'll 
                         send a packet to Micker, tell them 
                         Luke's OK, and that... everything 
                         else that's happened. The rest of us 
                         will take an inventory of supplies, 
                         see where we stand. Okay?

               The others nod in weary agreement. As they start out, towards 
               the relative warmth of the greenhouse, Terri looks at Luke, 
               at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair. She smiles, 
               brushing some locks off his forehead.

                                     TERRI
                         C'mon. There's a pair of scissors in 
                         my medkit.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. NEXT MORNING

               As in the Science Area, this space has enough thin oxygen 
               for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted. McConnell and Luke 
               are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from 
               the REMO.

               Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek. 
               His beard is gone, his hair neatly trimmed. McConnell enjoys 
               Luke's own wonder at his transformation.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How do you feel?

                                     LUKE
                         Like I just got back my other three 
                         percent.

               McConnell smiles. Terri enters through the hatch, removing 
               her helmet.

                                     TERRI
                         The backup generator is salvageable, 
                         and two of the solar panels. I'm 
                         pretty sure I can get the oxygen 
                         still back into production, too. So 
                         we're not in such bad shape, 
                         considering.

                                     LUKE
                         Good work, Terri.

               McConnell, rummaging through Phil's backpack, drops an already-
               opened bag of M&Ms. The CANDIES scatter and bounce all over 
               the floor.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Look at that. Phil's idea of absolute 
                         essentials.

               Luke and Terri smile. McConnell scoops up the fallen M&Ms. 
               He slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of little 
               round CANDIES. Something tugging at the back of his mind...

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

               Phil's intricately designed M&M model of his "ideal woman", 
               floating weightlessly, as McConnell drifts past it, plucking 
               away a couple pieces of the candy. Phil reacting, in good-
               natured annoyance. The gap in the design left by McConnell's 
               theft...

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. ANOTHER SECTION. DAY

               CLOSE ON MCCONNELL

               As he trembles with excitement. With sudden comprehension.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's not a signature.

                                     LUKE
                              (puzzled)
                         What?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That noise from the Face... It's not 
                         a signature. It's a test.

               Luke and Terri stare at him.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. MOMENTS LATER

               McConnell sits in front of the computer back in the science 
               lab area, staring once again at the mysterious DNA model. 
               Luke and Terri stand behind him. McConnell's energy, his new 
               certainty, is almost electrifying.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's asking us for the right answer. 
                         It wants us to put in the missing 
                         pair of chromosomes.

                                     LUKE

                                     MCCONNELL
                         To prove that we're human.

               Terri and Luke look at each other, starting to understand.

                                     LUKE
                         We fired radar into that thing. 
                         Concentrated sound waves...

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Which it interpreted as a wrong 
                         answer... Yes! It's like a, a security 
                         alarm. When it gets an incorrect 
                         response, it defends itself.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil is listening in on radio. He's got panels open, wires 
               dangling, as he works his ongoing repair. He keys his mike, 
               uneasily.

                                     PHIL
                         So what happens when it gets the

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (hesitates)
                         I don't know. But we've got to find 
                         out.
                              (to Luke, pointing)
                         Can you work this the other way? 
                         Figure out which tones would be 
                         equivalent to the missing chromosomes? 
                         Then dub them into your recording of 
                         the signal?

                                     LUKE
                         I think so, yes.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What about the radar gun? Will it 
                         accept that input? Can we transmit a 
                         completed signal back to the Face?

               Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY

               Phil is also growing increasingly nervous.

                                     PHIL
                         Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if 
                         you're wrong? Whoever goes out 
                         there... I mean, what if you're wrong? 
                         Three people have already died over 
                         that thing.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell.

                                     TERRI
                         Four.

               McConnell looks at her.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Terri, if we leave here without 
                         getting some answers, they all died 
                         in vain.

               Terri shakes her head.

                                     TERRI
                         We just don't know enough about that -- 
                         that thing out there to take any 
                         more chances.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         What are we here for, if not to take 
                         chances...?

               His passion startles them; they've never seen him so 
               emotional. He points at the computer screen.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         This means we're not alone. It means 
                         we're on the brink of the greatest 
                         discovery in mankind's history. But 
                         we've still got to prove it. Who 
                         knows when someone else will get 
                         back here? Or if they ever will? You 
                         know what Congress is like. They'll 
                         say it's too dangerous, too much 
                         loss of life, let's go back to 
                         unmanned flights. We could be the 
                         last explorers to come here for 
                         decades. We're it, guys.
                              (pause)
                         We're it.

                                     LUKE
                              (quietly)
                         We don't have to go out there. There's 
                         a better way.

               They look at him, surprised.

               The familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across 
               ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back. 
               Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass 
               rumble of the Face is very loud from here.

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he 
               pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, 
               then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the

               ON THE MONITOR

               They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot 
               from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE...

               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than 
               they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick 
               as he maneuvers the remote surveyor.

                                     MCCONNELL

                         I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop 
                         by that boulder.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

               Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially 
               shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun 
               swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY

               Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid 
               of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively 
               down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods.

               Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of 
               awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who 
               finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY

               From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched 
               electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as 
               it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops.

               For a moment nothing happens.

               Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining 
               sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains.

               ANGLE ON THE FACE

               As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins 
               to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding 
               out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement 
               is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, 
               it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. 
               No inside details can be seen.

               INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY

               McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon, 
               awed. They're barely breathing.

                                     PHIL

                         Check for radiation.

               Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout.

                                     LUKE
                         Normal. Seismic... normal. Anemometer 
                         steady. No sign of the vortex.

                                     PHIL
                         I don't know what we did, but guys -- 
                         does that look to you like a hostile 
                         gesture?

                                     TERRI
                         No. More like an invitation.

                                     LUKE
                         Or another test...

               McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face, 
               a growing look of determination.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Luke, the four-man rover. Does it 
                         still work?

               The others look at him, their expressions changing as they 
               realize what he's implying.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. LATE DAY

               McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock. 
               Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has 
               picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off 
               in astonishment towards

               A FRIGHTENING SIGHT

               The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into 
               purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above. 
               The DUST STORM has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers 
               away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand 
               meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand-
               kilometer front.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to 
               Luke, whose expression is grim.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How long before it hits?

                                     LUKE
                         An hour? Maybe less.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         How bad?

                                     LUKE
                         A storm like that? It could go 
                         planetary. And last a year.

               McConnell stares at him.

                                     LUKE
                         It'll sock us in, Jim. We won't be 
                         able to take off. If that happens, 
                         with what few supplies we've got 
                         left...? We'll starve to death.

               McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The 
               others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again. 
               There's the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil, how much longer to prep the 
                         ERV?

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe forty-five minutes. It'll be 
                         tight, but we can make it.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Then there's still time for us to 
                         get out there and back.

               He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other. 
               Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Stay here. Continue the repair. If 
                         something goes wrong, you get out of 
                         here before that storm hits.

                                     PHIL
                         Go back... alone?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         If we're not back in forty-five 
                         minutes, I want you to prep and 
                         launch.
                              (looks at his armpad 
                              display)
                         That's 1950 hours.

                                     PHIL
                         Jim --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         It's not a suggestion, it's an order. 
                         You understand?

                                     PHIL
                              (reluctantly)
                         I understand. But --

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You understand what?

                                     PHIL
                         If you're not back by 1950, I prep 
                         and launch.

               McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Let's go.

               They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more 
               thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil 
               stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DUSK

               In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across 
               the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the 
               storm approaches from that direction. It's marching 
               relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning 
               now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes 
               spinning off near its purple-black base...

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil has panels off. He's reaching into the guts of the main 
               computer, working feverishly. His repair kit is beside him.

               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. DUSK

               In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and 
               its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light 
               is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover 
               arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels.

               GROUND LEVEL SHOT

               Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the 
               Face. The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the 
               white light strains our eyes. The three astronauts ENTER 
               FRAME as we see them, from behind, staring up.

               ON THE ASTRONAUTS' AWED FACES

               As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic 
               mystery before them. Luke and Terri look at McConnell. Another 
               moment of critical decision. He keys his mike.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Phil, do you read me?

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil keys his own mike.

                                     PHIL
                         Yeah, Jim. Your signal's breaking up 
                         a little in the storm, but I read 
                         you.

               EXT. THE FACE. DUSK

               McConnell stares into the bright opening. Bathed in its light.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're at the Face. We're gonna need 
                         a few minutes here. Same deadline, 
                         launch at 1950. With or without us. 
                         Do you copy?

                                     PHIL
                              (pause)
                         Copy that.

               Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance.

                                     TERRI
                         Jim, are you sure you want to do 
                         this?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm not sure of anything anymore. 
                         But I didn't come a hundred million 
                         miles just to turn back in the last 
                         ten feet.

               Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal. 
               McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of 
               them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath. 
               Then they walk forward together, into the light.

               INT. THE FACE. DUSK

               The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a 
               free hand.

               The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, 
               textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls, 
               ceiling, even a floor.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Surface seems firm and level.

                                     LUKE
                         Roger that. Texture is smooth.

                                     TERRI
                         I've got good footing and no 
                         obstructions. Let's check our --

               Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock 
               sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of 
               each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they 
               came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some 
               sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.

                                     TERRI
                         It's solid again! We're trapped.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Don't move! Keep this orientation.

               The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the 
               brightness, some twenty feet apart.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (keys his mike)
                         Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. DUSK

               Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the 
               main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved.

                                     PHIL
                         Computers are online! Ready to load 
                         software. But guys -- we're losing 
                         visibility here.

               He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then 
               realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio.

                                     PHIL
                         Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone 
                         there...?

               No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't leave me.

               INT. FACE. DUSK

               McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see 
               that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the 
               shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He 
               hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his 
               right glove.

               Terri and Luke see this.

                                     TERRI
                              (alarmed)
                         Jim, what're you doing? You'll 
                         depressurize!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I don't think so.

               McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the 
               hiss of rushing air.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim, seal it!

                                     MCCONNELL
                         No. That was air going into my suit, 
                         not out. Look at your own suits -- 
                         they're not rigid anymore. We've got 
                         pressure in here.

               Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right.

                                     TERRI
                         Above Mars atmospheric? That's 
                         impossible.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We're millions of miles from Earth 
                         and we're inside a gigantic white 
                         face. What's impossible?

               Terri types on her arm keypad. She's amazed.

                                     TERRI
                         There's six psi in here...
                              (taps more keys)
                         Nitrogen and oxygen.

                                     LUKE
                         Otherwise known as air?

               Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. 
               Luke follows suit.

                                     TERRI
                         Hey, there may be some lethal trace 
                         gasses I haven't picked up yet, or... 
                         or... oh, the hell with it.

               Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all 
               three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against 
               their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. 
               And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed 
               another kind of test...

               HIGH, STRIATED WALL

               Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled 
               eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, 
               plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height 
               and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the 
               hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach 
               ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from 
               within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.

               THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK

               Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end 
               of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame

               A SHAPE MATERIALIZES

               And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, 
               which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign, 
               wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the 
               astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to 
               say "Enter." All her motions are both calm and calming -- 
               precise, unhurried, gracious.

               MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI

               Look at each other. They're awed into silence, and still 
               tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than 
               fear. Their eyes agree: Let's go.

               They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the 
               ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, 
               who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and 
               disappear inside.

               INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK

               Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open 
               space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor, 
               but without apparent walls.

               The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop, 
               too, uncertain what they're meant to do. Then the Martian 
               gestures again.

               A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the 
               floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie 
               lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this 
               column, forming a loose triangle. As they stare into it, the 
               myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their 
               spacesuits.

               IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC COLUMN

               The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to 
               them the story of ancient Mars:

               A BLUE PLANET

               we do not recognize. All is peaceful, beautiful.

               INTERCUT

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah. It's Mars.

               SUDDENLY A HUGE ASTEROID

               Tumbles through space towards the planet...

                                     TERRI
                         Oh my God.

               ON THE PLANET - CLOSER VIEW

               As thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface, 
               heading in a stream out of the solar system...

               THE ASTEROID IMPACTS

               And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. Oceans boil 
               and vaporize. Two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the 
               planet, spinning in flames...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...

               THE PLANET IS NOW DEAD

               As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. The 
               flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.

               IN DEEP SPACE

               The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it 
               continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system. 
               Then we zero in on

               ONE PARTICULAR ROCKETSHIP

               As it peels off and goes in another direction. Graphics show 
               a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix 
               of DNA. The ship heads towards another blue planet in our 
               solar system...

               EARTH

               As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the 
               landforms all wedged together.

               TERRI

               Her voice is soft.

                                     TERRI
                         Earth, when it was still Pangaea. 
                         Before the continents separated.

               THE LONE MARTIAN SHIP

               Makes a fiery streak through Earth's atmosphere and plunges 
               into the ocean.

               Instantly the image of the DNA double helix grows, filling 
               the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and 
               pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new 
               images...

               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI

               Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as

               LIVING FORMS

               Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, 
               crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms, 
               plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, 
               birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning 
               panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive 
               sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck

               FACES OF THE ASTRONAUTS

               Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column 
               dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric, 
               colored rings on the floor. The astronauts are left staring 
               at each other across the open space where the column had 
               been.

               THE MARTIAN

               Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their 
               circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite 
               her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The 
               Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. 
               As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into 
               McConnell's eyes.

               MCCONNELL

               Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's 
               the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness 
               or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         They're us. We're them...

                                     LUKE
                         We're Martians...?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's what she means.

                                     TERRI
                         Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion.

               McConnell and Luke look at her.

                                     TERRI
                         Almost six hundred million years 
                         ago, there was a sudden expansion of 
                         life on Earth. The first multi-celled 
                         plants and animals appeared. No one 
                         has ever understood why...

                                     LUKE
                         They seeded Earth.

               We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and 
               simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor 
               begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.

               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the 
               circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the 
               outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally 
               reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo 
               blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter 
               here, like stars against a midnight sky.

               THE MARTIAN

               Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in 
               particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle 
               of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first 
               time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as 
               abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.

               Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, 
               static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.

                                     PHIL
                              (over radio)
                         ...in, please. Can you... me?

               Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.

                                     TERRI
                         Phil, we're here! We read you.

               Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the 
               relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation.

                                     PHIL
                         Thank God! Listen, this storm is 
                         really --
                              (loud static)
                         -- few more minutes, I can't --
                              (more static)
                         You've gotta get back to the ship!

               And then they hear only STATIC. His signal is lost.

                                     TERRI
                         Phil? Phil...?

               Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, 
               with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of 
               the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as

               THE FIRST ORANGE BAND

               Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this 
               new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         We are in a ship. This is a ship. 
                         And the countdown has already started.

               Terri looks at Luke, alarmed.

                                     LUKE
                         He's right.

                                     TERRI
                         Then let's get the hell out of here!

               She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches 
               it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they 
               came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware 
               that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still 
               rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of 
               the colored rings.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim...

               McConnell doesn't turn.

                                     LUKE
                         Jim, we gotta go.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm not coming with you.

                                     TERRI
                              (stunned)
                         What?

               Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.

                                     TERRI
                         What are you talking about? We've 
                         got to get home.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         That's where I'm going. Don't you 
                         see? That's what all this is for.
                              (McConnell gestures 
                              at the ship around 
                              them)
                         You were right Terri. This is an 
                         invitation. To follow them. To follow 
                         them home.

               He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this 
               idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half 
               smile.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I have to go. This is the mission 
                         now. To find out who we are. Isn't 
                         that why we came here? Like Maggie 
                         said, "To stand on a new world and 
                         look beyond it to the next one."

               Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers 
               too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them 
               both.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         You know, when you think about it -- 
                         I wasn't even supposed to be here -- 
                         all the accidents, everything that 
                         got us to this point, it's just... 
                         it's just... I just know it's right.

               Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But 
                         you're running out of time. You've 
                         gotta get back to the ERV and get 
                         off this planet. Now please go.

               Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.

                                     LUKE
                         I once felt like I was taking your 
                         turn. But now I think maybe you're 
                         taking mine. Guess I'm a little 
                         jealous.

               They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a 
               lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.

                                     LUKE
                         Thanks for saving my life.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         My pleasure.

               Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet, 
               as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken 
               beat. Her eyes are glistening.

                                     TERRI
                         I wish Woody were here to see this. 
                         He would've wanted to go too, Jim.

               Terri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She's 
               going to be okay.

                                     MCCONNELL
                         He's here, Terri. We wouldn't have 
                         made it without him.

               Terri nods. She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls 
               something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes 
               around it.

                                     TERRI
                         Take care, Jim.

               McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns, 
               picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused, 
               looking back.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, Jim...?

                                     MCCONNELL
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         Have a great ride.

               Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, 
               then hurry away, into the darkness.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks down at what Terri gave him.

               IT'S WOODY'S NECK CHAIN

               With the little Flash Gordon rocketship.

               MCCONNELL

               Grips this tightly as he looks up.

               The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri, 
               helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of 
               the dust storm is upon them. They can't see much more than a 
               few meters.

               As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that 
               the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They 
               look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell 
               is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike.

                         I can barely read you. Let's get the

                         Is anyone there? Can anyone read me?

               Phil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He 
               hesitates, then starts hitting some keys.

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen 
               tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing 
               seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the 
               indigo circle at their core. He looks at

               THE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR

               As it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous 
               now, very deep and rapid.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

               The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards 
               the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face 
               behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying 
               debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust 
               chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they 
               speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly

               A TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER

               Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up 
               from the circumference of the indigo circle.

               Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops 
               down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse 
               in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as 
               neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.

               MCCONNELL

               Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being 
               imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually 
               immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't 
               even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping 
               switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his

               DIGITAL CLOCK

               Which reads "1350."

               PHIL IS STRICKEN, TORMENTED

               His finger hovers over a "Fire" button. He licks his lips 
               nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button.

               And the words: "IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED"

               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT

               McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds 
               him, when something catches his attention. He arches his 
               neck, looking down.

               A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID

               Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some 
               unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are 
               covered.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder 
               but

               HIS GLOVED HANDS

               Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

               MCCONNELL

               Looks down again.

               THE COBALT LIQUID

               Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...

               MCCONNELL

               Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, 
               can he somehow climb to safety?

               ABOVE HIM

               The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He 
               can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising 
               into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. 
               These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water 
               snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a 
               collision course.

               INT. ROVER. NIGHT

               Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri 
               stares at a dashboard computer screen. They have to shout to 
               be heard over the ROARING WIND.

                                     TERRI

                         Don't worry! I've worked with Phil 
                         for four years! I know Jim gave him 
                         a direct order, but he won't leave 
                         without us.

               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT

               The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing 
               it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It 
               disappears from view!

               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer 
               graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With 
               resignation, he keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         This is ERV, do you read? ERV to 
                         Rover, do you read...?

               Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red 
               switch that reads "LAUNCH." He hesitates, then actually has 
               his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle 
               of static on the radio. Phil keys his mike.

                                     PHIL

                         in.

               And Phil chokes back a sob. Blinking back the tears, he tries 
               to compose himself, then keys his mike.

                                     PHIL
                         Uh, Phil's not here right now. He 
                         left for Earth five minutes ago.

               EXT. THE FACE. NIGHT

               FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising 
               from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning 
               and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex. 
               But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, 
               this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks 
               begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, 
               cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing 
               uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face 
               itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming 
               vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, 
               causing a dark counter-swirl.

               EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. NIGHT

               Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it 
               to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust.

               THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm 
               seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out, 
               struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands, 
               helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused.

                                     PHIL

               LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue 
               fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his 
               shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring.

               He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep 
               his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

               He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing 
               from side to side. Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, 
               his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!

               The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top 
               of the cylinder.

               MCCONNELL

               Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much 
               fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting 
               for his inevitable death...

               side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the 
               Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical 
               shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the 
               Martian ship. It is a flattened convex circle whose matte-
               metallic angles replicate the "Face" imagery.

               The vortex is now a tight, rapidly spinning cylinder. As it

               Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the 
               huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded 
               of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the 
               same thing about to happen to McConnell?

               His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his 
               lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken 
               from his lungs.

               a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE 
               PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them 
               as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view 
               them from new and slightly different angles. These images 
               INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near-

               Time itself seems to stop.

               McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then, 
               fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his 
               mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe 
               it.

               His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe 
               it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes, 
               the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully 
               trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his 
               eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...

               specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a 
               rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast, 
               blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface,

               vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's 
               surface, which it now completely covers.

               As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship, 
               much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on 
               a different trajectory. We recognize the familiar, comfortable

               just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit 
               interior is starkly bathed in white light. They wince at the 
               unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved 
               hands.

                                     TERRI
                         Dear God. Look at that.

               Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship 
               hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.

                                     PHIL
                         Is that him?

               Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a 
               whisper, both of prayer and farewell.

                                     LUKE
                         Godspeed Jim McConnell.

               EXT. SPACE

               Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship 
               receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-
               white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is 
               a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless 
               expanse of the star-filled heavens.

          ALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed
          only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps
          that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color,
          chalks "Futur Anterieur" in precise cursive at the board.

                         ALICE
          "By tomorrow, we will have flown to
          France."
          She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS.
          Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are
          simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination
          that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.

                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Who can give me an example? Paul?
           NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be

          "I will have completed the assigned
          translation by the end of
          vacation."

                         ALICE
          C'est bon! Amber?

                         AMBER
          I will have failed French again by
          the end of the year.
          Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.

          EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex 
          calculus formula at the board while all of her TWELFTH GRADE
          MALE STUDENTS avidly admire her shape in a tight, stylish
          skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Okay! Kyle?
          KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.

                         KYLE
          Um... I guess I'm a little lost.
          If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a
          constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a
          level of wilfulness is required.

                         EMMA
          Try to follow along. I really want
          you guys to get this! David?
          DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.

          TWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot
          holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a
          sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast.
          The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes
          from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room.
          Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup,
          Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference.
          She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls
          leap back with a shriek, shakes her head.
          The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the
          handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly
          snuffing the flames.
          They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.

                         MEG
          Do me a favor, and let's just try
          to get to vacation.

          Alice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend
          RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's
          jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats,
          exit the school among a crush of students.
          Together, they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow,
          to the parking lot, stopping at Alice's weathered Volvo where
          Richard hands over the binders with a kiss.

                         RICHARD
          Got practice until five thirty,
          then I'll be by.

                         ALICE
          I'll see you then. Thanks.
          They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic
          fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.

                          RICHARD
          Hey, Meg! Bon voyage!
          Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.

                         ALICE
          I finished our travel binders!
          Meg takes the binder, looks it over.

                         MEG
          Remind me again why we're taking
          phonebooks to France?
          Alice gives her a look.

          You know, for the first time in a
          long time, I feel just as lucky as 
          any of these kids. They may have
          their whole lives ahead of them but
          we've got a week in Paris.

          Oh, that's right. I keep

          Emma's packed suitcases stand neatly arranged by the door of
          the sparsely furnished, undecorated room.

          You have no messages.
          Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the
          record button on her answering machine, then speaks with a
          put-on, coolly sophisticated,'jet-setting accent.

                         EMMA
          Hello. You've reached the home of
          Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't
          be able to return your call right
          away, as I'm currently traveling.
          In Europe. But, please, do leave a
          message.

          Princess'...
          Emma turns at the counter to see Princes Diana touring an
          African encampment with children on the television.

                         EMMA
          Ooh!
          She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee 
          table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved
          Lean Cuisine dinner.
          She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the
          cards, shuffling.
          Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly
          shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in
          perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp.

          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Alice opens the door, kissing Richard who holds up a suitcase
          in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other.

                         RICHARD
          Special delivery.

          INT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Alice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory
          as Richard pours the Champagne into two glasses.

                         ALICE
          That's it! I am good to go!

          I'm proud of you, you know.
          Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed,
          climbing on top of him.

                         ALICE
          Like Christmas when I was a kid.
          There's no way I'm going to be able
          to sleep tonight--

                         RICHARD
          Good for me.
          They kiss.

                         ALICE
          I mean, how long have I been
          talking about this?

                         RICHARD
          Mmm... You were reading Colette.
          In the teacher's lounge. First
          time we met. Long time.
          Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside.

                         RICHARD (CONT'D)
          This is just the beginning.

                         ALICE

                         (BRIGHTENING)
          It feels like it.
          They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass
          back then stop mid-sip to peer down at the delicate diamond
          ring sitting at the bottom of her glass.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)

          Richard takes her glass and fishes out the ring.

          Let's do this when I get back. In
          a week.

          Can you hear yourself?

                         ALICE
          Honey, listen, it's just the
          timing. I wasn't planning on this 

                         TONIGHT--

                         RICHARD
          Whoa. I planned tonight. Tonight
          was my plan--

                         ALICE
          And it's great. This is great.
          You're great. But, Richard, I feel
          like I just need to do this one
          thing first. Then I can do the
          next. Then I can do this.
          (off his silence)
          Can you understand? There's a
          world I haven't even seen yet...
          Alice, hopeful, searches Richard's inscrutable expression a
          beat, then he turns away and gets up, ring in hand.

                         RICHARD
          I thought we'd be seeing it
          together.
          (pockets the ring)
          Have a great trip, Alice.

          Alice listens to his footfalls and the slam of the front
          door, then falls back on the bed, striking her head on the
          open suitcase, wincing.

          INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY

          Meg sleeps in an aisle seat of the dim coach cabin where all
          the window shades have been drawn down, Emma dozing beside
          her, a game of cards laid out on her tray table.

                         
          Alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed
          and sits, hyper-alert, looking at her closed window shade.
          A beat.
          She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack,
          flooding their row with light.
          She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade
          higher, drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees.
          She flings the shade up.
          ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
          wheel with the Eiffel Tower as its central axle.
          Her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in.
          She turns, eyes full, to Meg who cranes across Emma to share
          in the view and squeeze Alice's arm with a smile.

          Alice emerges with Meg and Emma, each struggling with their
          luggage, onto the thronged arrivals deck.

                         EMMA
          There it is! Esprit de Corps!
          Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue
          flag at the end of a long staff held by MADAME VALERY (40s,
          pinched) their harried tour guide in a suit of the same blue.

                         ALICE

          Alice, Meg and Emma race past gallery after gallery, trying
          to keep Madame Valery's little blue flag in sight as it flies
          over the crowd in the distance.
          Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making
          notes in her guidebook on the fly.

                         ALICE
          Try to remember that! We'll double

          Madame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru
          staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory.
          Alice stops Meg and Emma in front of the statue, while Carl
          and Deedee try to catch their breath on the landing.

          Emma elbows her way out of a crush of raised cameras and

          the rest of their tour at too few tables.

          To jet lag.
          Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk
          down identical plates of steak frites before them.

          she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind

          He was just looking for the catsup-

                         CARL
          If you're not using it.
          As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her
          napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them
          with creme brulees.

                         ALICE
          Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur--

                         (RECEIVING CATSUP)
          Merci!
          He turns now, catsup in hand, to blink at the creme brulee
          that has replaced his own and Deedee's steaks.

                         
          Alice places a hand on Madam Valery's arm as she passes.

                         ALICE
          Pardon, Madame, but...
          Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.

          I'm sorry, but--

           EXT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Esprit de Corps tour members disembark from their bus in
          front of a comically narrow and vertical Baroque hotel with
          its name in feeble buzzing neon: Le Petit Sommeil.

                         ALICE (PRE-LAP)
          Look! Look at this picture and
          tell me what's different!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          The women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a
          tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which
          they stand; dingy, impossibly small, crowded by an armoire
          that nearly meets the low sloping ceiling, with two spindly
          twin beds and a military-style cot.

                         EMMA
          Toujour le suck-ez vous.

                         ALICE
          I researched at least a million

                         TOURS--

                          MEG
          Well. This is the one we could
          afford.
          A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          It's only five nights--

                         EMMA
          Five nights? Here?!

                         MEG
          And, Alice, you said yourself,
          we'll hardly ever be in our room.

                         (SELLING IT)
          It'll be like camping. At Eagle
          River. It'll be fun!
          Emma opens what is essentially a closet with a toilet.

                         EMMA
          Here's your outhouse, Meg. Go
          nuts.
          Alice joins Emma at the bathroom door.

                         MEG
          Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack--
          she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight
          of Emma's suitcase as she reaches to lift it.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          Holy--! Alice, help--
          Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift.

                         ALICE
          Emma, what have you got in here?

                         EMMA
          Just the stuff you put on my list--
          (off her look)
          And a couple options.
          The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the
          bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which
          flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Hey! Come on, guys!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Alice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and
          the ugly backsides of buildings, as Meg and Emma sleep
          fitfully behind her.
          She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling
          through her speed dial to stop at: 1. Richard.
          She hesitates with her thumb over the "call" button.
          She turns back to the miserable view, considering for a beat,
          then folds her phone away as she blinks back tears.

          EXT. PONT DES ARTS BRIDGE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads a diminished flock, bobbing her staff
          with its blue flag, in a forced march across the span of the
          ornate pedestrian bridge toward the waiting tour bus.

          The Pont des Arts has it's name for
          the vast number of art students
          that come here to paint this famous
          city view...
          Meg and Emma, the worse for wear, trail Madame Valery at a
          distance with Alice who now leads her own handful of tour
          members, Carl and Deedee among them.

                         ALICE
          It's called the Pont des Arts
          because the Louvre was formally
          known as the Palais des Arts...
          Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and
          her cluster of appreciative followers.

                         MADAME VALERY
          People! We must keep together!

          EXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL -- DAY

          Alice's group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a
          star-shaped brass inset on the pavement outside Notre Dame.

                         

                         DEEDEE
          "Point zero. Dez roots dee France."

                         ALICE
          It's from right here that all the
          highway miles in all of France are
          measured. They also say that if
          you stand on this exact spot, you
          are be destined to return to France
          in the future.

                         MEG
          Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone!
          Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.

                         EMMA
          I want a picture! Of all of us!
          Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery
          leading her dwindling group from the great church.
          Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads
          straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE
          to take a group photo with her camera.

          Madame Valery sizes Alice up and taps her staff as the group
          forms around them, joined by the Japanese couple.

          folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery.

                         MADAME VALERY
          Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied
          with my tour she could conduct her
          own.

          the hotel's canopy.
          They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their

          Okay, Emma, it's down the hall to
          the left. Meg and I'll go and get
          us a table--

                         EMMA
          Meet you in there.
          Emma heads for the ladies room, gaping at the lobby.

          Wow...

                         MEG
          Get us a table? Alice, we can't

          We're going to do one thing right
          in Paris. I don't care how much it
          costs.
          They turn for the dining room, passing the front desk where
          CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT (dressed similarly to Emma, though at
          ten times the cost) unleashes her ire on the CONCIERGE.

                         CORDELIA
          And, just how do you propose I am
          to travel tomorrow, then?

          Emma swings through the door into the black marble bathroom,
          grabbing a towel to swipe at her wet hair.
          She stops abruptly, examines the towel.

                         EMMA
          These are cloth!
          She takes the towel into one of the stalls, closing the door
          behind her just as Cordelia strides in, stops at the counter.

          Cordelia's cellphone RINGS! and she pulls it from her purse.

          EMMA (O.S.)
          Hello?

          You would not believe these people.
          So rude!
          She takes her phone into the stall next to Emma's and closes
          the door just as Alice and Meg enter.

          CORDELIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          And they wonder why none of us do

          Alice and Meg look at one another in the mirror, overhearing
          Cordelia, as they pick up towels to dry off.

           CORDELIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          I don't know. Some auction. One
          of those foundations--. But, have
          I heard from them? No. And they

          Reykjavik? Would I need a coat?
          A toilet flushes and Cordelia opens her stall door, heads for
          the counter, oblivious to Alice and Meg who freeze with their
          towels, blinking at her uncanny resemblance to Emma.

          Do you know if there's an evening
          flight--?
          Alice and Meg turn to each other, then to Cordelia's
          reflection in the glass, their mouths hanging open.

          Ooh, I think I can just make it.
          No. I won't even check out here.

          Cordelia stops when her eyes snag on Alice and Meg.

          Let me call you when I get to the
          airport. It may take awhile...
          She gives Alice and Meg a devastating look up and down.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          It appears to be raining outside.
          Quite hard.
          She picks up her purse and exits without looking back just as
          Emma opens her stall door and joins Alice and Meg, who gape
          at her with towels in their hands.

          Well, she sounded awful. And kind

          Alice, Meg and Emma, punchy and a little drunk, enjoy wine
          from enormous glasses as they finish their meals.

                         ALICE
          (draining her glass)
          She should be ashamed. Can you
          imagine having a room here and then
          not staying in it?
          An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass.

          The waiter retreats, joining FIVE others standing at
          discreet, fearful attention, all careful not to look at Emma
          whom they've clearly mistaken her for Cordelia.

          We should just take it. Her room.

          A telephone rings, stirring Alice. It rings again.
          She reaches for it in her sleep as Emma sits up groggily
          beside Meg curled around the empty Champagne bottle.

                         ALICE

          Hello?

          What time is it?
          Alice's eyes fly open as she snaps awake.

                         ALICE
          Oh, yes. Yes...

                         (SHAKING MEG)
          Meg, wake up. We're in trouble--
          Meg pulls herself up, sees Alice on the phone.

                         MEG

                         
          Oh, shiii--

          We'll be right down. Merci.
          She hangs up.

          The three women increase their pace, but the manager catches
          up to them with an express envelope.

          Mademoiselle Scott, this came for
          you this morning. The package you
          were seeking?
          Emma merely blinks at the offered envelope.

          Take it. Just take it.

          As they emerge, the manager and doormen hustle Alice, Emma
          and Meg towards a waiting car and driver, as paparazzi call
          and shoot from across the boulevard.

                         ALICE
          Thank you so much but I think we'll

          Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who
          waves them farewell, the doorman shooing photographers.

          They really do think she's her...
          RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's

          Trip's paid for, whether that girl

          area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the
          incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay.

          That horrible, irresponsible girl!
          I've never stolen a thing in my
          life, now I've taken a trip from
          school children.

          Meg hangs her head.

          They're counting on her for a

          She did?

          Alice and Meg stand in front of the tower of Louis Vuitton
          trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock
          of a steel briefcase in her lap.

                         ALICE
          Okay. But, just for tonight. And,
          that's it.
          CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open
          briefcase, eyes wide.

                         EMMA
          Lucky guess?

          A necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles
          like a constellation from within the case's velvet lining.

          The gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO
          DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in
          Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza.
          Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable
          tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's
          raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the
           tony European jet set.

          At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer 
          scrutiny one can read Meg's composed discomfort in wearing a
          dress that is too tight, nearly spilling her breasts, and the
          self-consciousness Alice endures in a dress made daringly
          short by her height.
          But, this is because we know them; to all other eyes they not
          only belong here, they own the room.
          They glance at one another, eyebrows up: "We're here!"

                         EMMA
          Don't you feel like we've won
          something already?
          Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA
          SILVANO (30's, movie-star handsome), both in tuxedos,
          offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Mademoiselle Scott, you made it!
          Emma withholds her natural smile, placing just the tips of
          her fingers in Jean-Pierre's palm with exaggerated hauteur.

                         EMMA
          Enchante. 
          Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of
          her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place
          with a hand as she steps down.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And Mademoiselle Margaret Kelly and
          Mademoiselle Alice Perry--

                         (FOR ALICE)
          I am very glad you were able to
          come this evening.

          May I present His Highness, Prince

          Shall we?
          Alice and Meg allow Jean-Pierre to lead them, following Emma
          as GAMBLERS break from their games to track these three
          elegant women gliding smoothly through the room.

                         MEG
          (aside to Alice)
          I may as well be topless.

          A DEALER unseals a new deck of cards as Domenico pulls out a
          chair for Emma at the room's enormous game table.

                         EMMA
          Oh, but, I really wasn't planning
          on playing this evening. I so much
          prefer to watch--
          Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads
          them to the far side of a low railing to view the game.

          He turns to the eight other PLAYERS (of various ages and
          genders, but all rich) clustered at the room's small bar.

                         DOMENICO (CONT'D)
          Ladies and gentlemen? Shall we
          begin?
          The other players make obligatory introductions and take up
          positions at the table as Jean-Pierre offers Alice and Meg
          tall upholstered stools to sit.

          Alice moves to sit, but then remembers her skirt, looks to 
          Meg who is unable to even raise a leg in her tight dress.

                         ALICE

                         (TO JEAN-PIERRE)

          Jean-Pierre hands them both a glass of Champagne.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          And why aren't you playing?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Ah. I play behind the scenes.
          Like Robin Hood, I take from those
          who have more than enough, for
          those who have nothing but need.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Also, I do not play because I have
          no money of my own.
          Alice smiles, charmed by his candor, but then stops.

                         ALICE
          They're playing for money?
          (turns to Meg, flat)

                         IS
          They're playing for money.
          Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards
          she is dealt in her hands.

                         DOMENICO
          Cordelia, why don't you do us the
          honor of setting this evening's
          stakes?
          Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her,
          ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly.

                         EMMA
          Oh. Um. Okay...
          She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks.

          Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back
          of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill.
          The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp
          napkin, struggling to breathe.

          Jean-Pierre's attention.

          this--!

                          ALICE
           What?!

                          DOMENICO
          I will see you, Cordelia.
          Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the
          center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands
          when the dowager folds her cards.

                         EMMA
          (whisper to Alice)
          Now, go sit down and try to be
          cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me
          handle this.
          Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes
          the water Jean-Pierre offers.

                         MEG
          What'd she say? What'd she say?

                         ALICE

                         (SICK)
          We're going down, Meg. Going down
          hard.

          Alice and Meg turn helplessly to the game table.

                         DOMENICO
          Ladies first.

                         EMMA
          After you. Please.
          Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his
          three aces.

                         DOMENICO
          I am very sorry, Cordelia.
          A beat, then Emma shrugs.

                         EMMA
          Well. It is just a game after all.
          She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A
          royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          I do hope there are no hard
          feelings.
          The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes.
          Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab
          each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over,
          glasses spilling, as the other players applaud.
          Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both
          arms, laughing as she's congratulated.

                         DOWAGER
          You must play often, Miss Scott.

                         EMMA
          Oh, a little, online. But, this is
          so much more fun!

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Domenico and Jean-Pierre, each toting buckets of chips,
          escort Alice, Emma and Meg to the elevator, all giddy.

                         DOMENICO
          Not even a last drink in the bar?

          It's been such a splendid evening,
          I am reluctant to press my luck any
          further.

                         MEG
          Yeah. Good call, Cordelia.
          DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico
          leans in towards Emma.

                         DOMENICO
          Then you must promise to dance with
          me at my party tomorrow.
          Emma evades Domenico by stepping onto the elevator.

                         EMMA
          Oh, Delmonico--

                         DOMENICO
          "Domenico."

                         EMMA
          I would not miss it for the world.

                         
          Meg collects the buckets from Domenico and steps on.

                         MEG
          Great meeting you, your Highness.
          Good times. Really.
          Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain
          frisson to the simple exchange.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Tomorrow night?

                         EMMA
          Wait!
          Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of
          the buckets from Alice and hands it back to him.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          You must keep this one. For your
          foundation.

          But, your family has already been

          The doors start to close.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Good night, then.

                         DOMENICO
          And, welcome to Monte Carlo.
          The doors close, leaving Jean-Pierre and Domenico to gaze
          fondly where the three women had just been.
          They both sigh and turn for the bar, when they hear shrieking
          from the elevator as it rises above them.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Alice, Meg and Emma jump up and down, screaming like girls at
          a slumber party, chips flying everywhere.

                         MONTAGE:

          EXT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY


                         
          Alice, Meg and Emma burst through the salon doors into the
          street, their hair color richer, eyes brighter, a new
          lightness to their step; vivid, brilliantly polished versions
          of their essential selves.
          Heads turn as they set out together.

          INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

          The wings of a brass-framed three-way mirror spin and spread
          in a swirling kaleidoscope of shifting reflections:
          Alice, Meg and Emma work their way through an increasingly
          spectacular and audacious series of combinations, dresses and
          gowns, modeling for each other as they are tended to by
          SHOPGIRLS and SEAMSTRESSES...
          --Alice twirls in a navy dress with white polka dots.
          --Meg slaps her own ass with a laugh, admiring herself from
          the back in a pair of pencil thin sexy black jeans.
          --Emma glows in a pale lavender strapless satin gown.

          Alice, Meg and Emma watch as a number of their dresses are
          boxed and a CASHIER writes them up.

                         SHOP GIRL
          Would you like these put on your
          account, Mademoiselle Scott?

                         ALICE
          No. Thank you, we'll be paying

                         CASH--

                         EMMA
          But, it would be darling if you
          could have them sent round our
          hotel.

                         MEG
          Wait. You know what, on second
          thought, I'm not getting these--
          She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.

                         EMMA
          But, they looked amazing on you!

          You wear them here! Anywhere!
          Alice, you tell her--
          Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander
          the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in
          every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm not going to tell you what
          to do.

                         MEG
          Thank you. It's silly, anyway.
          They're just jeans. I want to find

          Emma leaps to one of the stalls, seizing a profusion of 
          plastic jeweled tiaras displayed alongside photographs of
          Princess Grace. She places a tiara on her head, modeling.

          Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them
          from their ribbon laces.

          INT. SHOE REPAIR SHOP - DAY

          A SHOP OWNER (60's) slips a pair of freshly polished men's
          shoes into a paper bag, placing them on the counter in front
          of Richard, who pulls out his wallet.

                         RICHARD

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Oh. And the suitcase.
          The shop owner retrieves Alice's mended suitcase from a
          nearby shelf, a tag on the zipper.

          RICHARD (CONT'D) 
          How much do I owe you for that?

          EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

          Richard exits the shoe repair carrying Alice'.s repaired
          suitcase, headed for his car.

          Hey, Richard!
          Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with
          Seamus and Finn, pushing a cart piled high with groceries.

                         CUT TO:
          Richard finishes helping Glenn and the kids transfer grocery
          bags to the open trunk of Glenn's squad car.

          sportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on
          the other side of the open stall.
          He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce,
          lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile.
          Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and
          down her front.
          She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping
          when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement.
          Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along
          the line of stalls.
          Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at
          another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to
          prepare the fish they both admire.
          Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of
          it to gesture responses.
          The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and
          thrusts it towards Meg with a smile.

          The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I don't have a kitchen. No place
          to cook.

          She is only a visitor. Without a
          kitchen. But, it is a beautiful
          fish. Maybe next time.

                         BERNARD
          You are American.
          Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious,
          drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges
          with various vendors as they walk.

                         MEG
          From Wisconsin. Yes.
          Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.

                         BERNARD
          You cook in Wisconsin?
          Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.

                         MEG
          I try. But... We don't have even
          half of this at home.
          She points to a tray of miniature lobsters.

          Glenn paces as Richard holds the phone at his desk, the

          Madame Valery, cellphone to her ear, leads'the few remaining
          members of her flock down the wide steps, across the Seine
          from the Eiffel tower.

                         MADAME VALERY
          She refused to follow my

          INT. VILLA DA SILVANO - NIGHT

          A cascade of yellow and gold balloons washes over Alice as
          she dances with Meg and Emma to a Euro-trance-pop beat at the
          center of the crowded dance floor.
          Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara,
          batting balloons as Domenico who spins her away.
          Alice watches with heightened vigilance as Emma dances with
          her prince and blows a kiss to Alice and Meg.

                         MEG

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And I was looking for you!
          From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s),
          squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and
          tails, watches Emma ardently.
          He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.

                         
          Emma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up
          this offering, and she takes him for a waiter.

                         EMMA
          Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty!
          Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
          watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks.
          She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai,
          really registering his presence now as she searches his warm,
          gentle eyes.

          room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to
          match her moves, insinuates himself.
          She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her
          back to evade him.
          Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo
          dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly.

          Penelope shakes her head almost imperceptibly.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          To do this.
          Emma opens her arms wide and pulls Penelope into a hug.
          She looks at Alice and Meg over Penelope's shoulder, and then
          closes her eyes with genuine emotion for a beat, pulling back
          to smile into Penelope's grateful, tear-streaked face.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Now... Friends?

          INT. BISTRO - LATE NIGHT


                         DOMENICO
          (raising a glass)
          To friends! old and new!
          Emma seizes Penelope's hand from across the table, placing it
          in Domenico's as she drunkenly sings the old Girl Scout song.

                         EMMA
          "Make new friends and keep the old,
          one is silver and the other's
          gold!"
          Alice and Jean-Pierre lean toward each other intimately'
          across the packed, lively table of PARTY-GOERS.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          But, no one really lives here.
          Monte Carlo. It's like Hong Kong.
          People merely come and go. People
          like me. Well, and then, people
           like yourself.

          Alice nods to a WAITER who arrives to refill her Champagne 
          glass, pouring as Jean-Pierre speaks.

                         ALICE
          People like me?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          People with money. This is why I
          come. I help assuage their guilt
          when I remind them that there are
          children in this world who do not
          have clean water to drink, while
          they drink Champagne.

                         ALICE
          And that works?
          Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          I take myself far too seriously.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--.
          I've seen the pictures of the
          schools. The work you do is

                         

                         ADMIRABLE--

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And I'm afraid I talk about it
          because I myself am not that
          interesting...
          (a hand on her arm)
          I'd rather know about you.

                         ALICE

                         (TRAPPED)
          Oh. Well. You know. I...do what
          I can, here and there. A little
          volunteer work...
          She turns to her Champagne, rolling her eyes at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Oh, brother.
          Meg sits further down the length of all the tables laid end
          to end, beside Giorgio, who has pulled his chair close,
          draping an arm casually across the back of hers.

                         MEG
          Okay, wait. You're a man, right?

                          MEG (CONT'D)
          Yeah, I know: I'm funny. But, see
          if you can answer something for me.
          Ten years you're married, to the
          girl you dated in high school. I'm
          talking the girl you lost your
          virginity to, the one who gave you
          two great kids that you're just
          crazy about. Then one morning,
          what? You wake up, and out of the
          blue, it's like, "Oh, hey, honey, I
          think I'm in love with this other
          woman..."

                         (PAUSES)
          His patrol partner.
          A beat as Giorgio shakes his head sadly.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I thought I was his partner.
          Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on.

                         GIORGIO
           You heart feels betrayed.

                         MEG
          (telling a secret)
          I feel like I failed.

                         GIORGIO
          I tell you this: A man...he will
          always love the mother of his
          children.
          Meg blinks, taking this in.

                         GIORGIO (CONT'D)
          Now you must kiss someone else.

                         MEG

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh, I see--

                         GIORGIO
          To break the spell. You must!
          Then you will be free.
          A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the
          table in front of Meg.

          Madame Kelly.
          He heads toward for the kitchen before she can say anything.
          Emma pours sloppy glasses of Champagne for her companions as
          though playing a game of tag, spilling wine.

                         EMMA
          And you're my friend...and you're
          my friend. . .and you're my--
          She turns with the bottle to find Nikolai who has
          materialized beside her on the long banquette.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey! You were at the party!
          Do you work here, too?
          Nikolai cheerfully shakes his head, holds up her purse.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Oh! Did I forget that? Wow, what

                         NIKOLAI
          Ti takaya vaskhititel'naya.
          Emma sets the bottle down to concentrate on Nikolai.

                         EMMA
          You're not from here, are you?

                         (OVER-ENUNCIATING)

          Alice and Jean-Pierre walk along, side by side, their hands
          nearly touching, among the rest of the restaurant party.
          Alice looks up, taking in the bowl of pre-dawn sky, and

          Ahead, Emma breaks away from Penelope and Domenico, leaving
          the two to walk on together as she comes back toward Alice.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Where's Meg?
          Alice looks around and sees Giorgio walking alone among the

          Bernard takes a tray of dishes from his FATHER (70's,
          striking resemblance) who enters from the dining room.

                         BERNARD
          Papa, sit down. Rest.

           Bernard enters with the tray, stopping when he sees Meg
          examining a menu by the front door of the empty bistro.

          You enjoyed your meal?

                         MEG
          Adding the fresh orange; nice.
          Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.

          We were--. We're going to watch

          Alice turns to Meg and Emma, sharing this moment so far
          beyond anything they could have dreamed.

          She runs for the sprays of water, pulling Alice and Meg, and

          Leaning against the fountain's balustrade, Emma gestures for

          Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards

          with her as the camera's flash.

          other in confusion, each processing for a beat.

          pantomimes that he recognizes Alice from the snapshot Richard
          shows him, but has no idea where she could be.
          Richard pulls out a map to point at a random spot and the

          He looks down the length of the Champs Elysees, overwhelmed.
          The Japanese couple from Notre Dame approach Richard to ask

          apartment blocks; home to the city's service workers.

          Scott and friends in Monte Carlo. Hotel de Paris, etc...

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING

          Alice feeds the little dog a scrap of meat as she eats a
          kabob, seated on the curb by a street vendor's food cart
          around which ALGERIAN MEN lounge in plastic lawn chairs.
           The dog looks at her avidly, hungry for more.
          Alice holds her kabob stick out for the dog to eat,
          surrendering her dinner with pleasure.
          As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces
          off the curb and rolls to a stop beside her.
          She looks up as a ragtag BAND OF KIDS call from the dusty lot
          across the street, asking for their ball.
          A beat as Alice regards the ball.

          INT./EXT. YACHT PARTY - EVENING

          Emma wears Cordelia's elaborate necklace, standing alone,
          within a throng of PARTY GOERS, all conversing in French.
          she nods and smiles absently, though she's clearly lost, out
          of her element, when Giorgio approaches.

                         GIORGIO
          Where is Meg? I do not see her.

                         EMMA
           No. I... I don't think she's
          0 coming. I'm sorry.

          Emma drifts away to the ship's rail where she turns to 
          survey the party, smiling wistfully at Penelope and Domenico
          locked in intimate conversation.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Cordelia! There she is! Cordelia!
          The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat,
          peppering the yacht with their camera flashes.
          Emma looks out at them, without her usual animation.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
          Smile, Cordelia! Please, smile!
          Emma waves, but can't seem to manage that smile.

                         NIKOLAI
          Ty v poryadke?
          Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie,
          a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other.
          Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the
          flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile.

                         EMMA

          He bows slightly, offering the cake.

          You work here too? You never get a
          night off...

          Seamus. He's ten. Built a website
          for his fourth grade class. Now
          he's got actual clients. And
          that's Finn, the prima ballerina.
          She'll be six in June--
          Emile examines photographs of Seamus and Charlotte from Meg's
          wallet while she refills their glasses at the kitchen table
          and Bernard works at the stove.

                         EMILE
          Elle est coquin, oui?

                         MEG
          Oh, she's no chicken. She's not
          scared of anything--

                         BERNARD

                         (LAUGHS)
          Not a chicken. He says, she looks
          like a rascal.

          No idea where she gets that...
          Meg lifts her glass with a sly smile as Bernard brings plates
          of food to the table.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          But, that's a nice word for it.

          I'm open! I'm open!
          Alice sails down the makeshift soccer field as one of the
          kids passes the ball to her, chased by the others.
          She dodges and kicks the ball through the goal to score.
          Her "team" jumps and cheers, as do a collection of spectators
          who have gathered to watch this tall red headed woman in a
          summer dress racing around the dusty lot with a band of kids.

          But, she is perfectly safe.

                         MEG
          Yeah. No. No way.
          Bernard straddles a beat up moped, motor running, as Meg
          shakes her head emphatically.

                         BERNARD
          I can not take you, if you will not
          get on.

                         MEG
          What do you want me to tell you?
          I'm not getting on that thing.
          Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics.

                         BERNARD

                         (AMIABLY)

          He swings a leg over the moped, revs the engine.

          Hold on.

          EXT. MOPED - NIGHT - MOVING

          Meg hangs on to Bernard as they zip along the beachfront
          drive and turns her face to the wind with a smile.
          She surrenders to the ride, the sheer fun of it, laughing.

                         MEG
          How do you say "faster?"

          INT. BLUE RIBBON RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Bernard and Meg, flush from their ride, enter the kitchen
          through a back door, to be hailed by a half-dozen CHEFS
          crowded around a table littered with dishes.

          HENRI (60's, a bear in chef's whites) lumbers towards them.

                         HENRI
          No! No! No! We are only cooks
          allowed here!

          This is Meg, from America.

                         (TO MEG)
          And this is Henri, the worst
          egotist, my mentor.
          The two men embrace, merrily kissing each other on both
          cheeks, then Henri pulls Meg under his arm.

                         HENRI

          A chef from America! Come to flip

          INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

          Jean-Pierre drives an open silver sports car full of PARTY
          GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion
          and crowd around the dirt lot.
          Then he spots Alice running-around.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - DIRT LOT - NIGHT

          Alice sticks like glue to a kid with the ball, maneuvers in,
          steals the ball, and doubles back in the opposite direction,
          racing up the field as the crowd laughs and claps.
          She passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal, scores.
          Alice looks up from the game at the tapping of a car horn to
          see Jean-Pierre honking in celebration as he leans against
          the car with his GUESTS, enjoying the game.
          Alice stops to wave, and takes the ball full in the face.

          from the car as worried kids and spectators form a circle
          around Alice's prone body.
          The little dog licks Alice's face and she opens her eyes.
          She leaps up as Jean-Pierre crosses the lot.

                         ALICE
          I'm up! I'm up! Let's go!
          She sets off down the field with the kids.

          EXT. YACHT - PRE-DAWN

          Empty and half-filled glasses, bottles litter every surface
          along with plates, ashtrays, crumpled napkins.
          Emma sits on the lower landing deck, legs in the water, shoes
          in her hand, looking out at the lights.
          Nikolai moves his legs in the gentle current beside her,
          tuxedo trousers rolled, while he concentrates on working a
          napkin into intricate folds.
          Emma turns to look back at the silent boat.

                         

                         EMMA
          It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you

          Nikolai holds up the napkin he's transformed into a crown
          adorned with flowers and the wire cages from Champagne corks.
          Emma looks at him, her face soft and vulnerable, open, as

          Meg tries to follow the discussions and familiar teasing of
          the chefs as they pass plates, goading her to taste.
          She looks over at Bernard, who smiles as he holds his hands
          up at the scene, his boisterous friends, the food; as though

                         
          to say "this is good, enjoy."
          Meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the
          table, spears a bite of food and lifts her glass to Bernard.

                         CUT TO:
          Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though
          onions at a blinding pace, their knives flashing, creating an
          escalating staccato on their cutting boards.
          Meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan, and slams her
          knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause.
          Henri seizes Meg's hand, raising her arm in the air, and
          presents her with a bottle of wine.
          Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as
          the other chefs clap her on the back, shake her hand.

          jacket over her shoulders.

          ALICE (V.O.)
          Well, Africa, then. How often do
          you get to go?
          He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
          building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.

          JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
          Not enough. Mostly I am on planes.

          parties make people generous.

          Alice's smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she
          leans against the hotel's crown beside Jean-Pierre. 

                         ALICE
          That seems a shame...

          It is just a small town, in a vast,
          open space. Maybe in the middle of
          America. There are people there
          like yourself, who are kind. And
          children who have everything they
          need.
          Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair
          in his fingers, and they hold a beat, looking at one another.

          Nikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand
          before Emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts.
          He lifts his hands: This is me. Here I am.
          Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare
          except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown.
          Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run,
          hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH!
          He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in
          with a SPLASH!
          She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game,
          and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain.
          They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him.
          A beat as they sober.

                         
          Emma pulls Nikolai close to her, and they kiss.
          On the landing deck, Emma's gown shimmers in the morning sun
          with Nikolai's crown and Cordelia's yellow gem and diamond
          necklace nestled among its satin folds.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAWN

          Alice, still wearing Jean-Pierre's jacket, walks down the
          hall with Jean-Pierre close beside her, neither speaking.
          She turns to him when they reach the door of her suite.
          A long beat stretches, full of every possibility.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Come with me.

                         ALICE
          What?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          To Dubai. I leave the day after--.
          What is today? Friday? I leave
          tomorrow. You could come too. You
           wouldn't need to bring anything.

                         ALICE 
          But--. Jean-Pierre...
          (a near confession)
          You don't know me.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          This is why I ask. I would like to
          know you, Alice. Very much.
          Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from
          her shoulders.

                         ALICE
          Before this, I'd never even been to
          France.
          Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          It's true. Just kept putting it
          off. Always managed to find an
          excuse. But, really, it was that I
          was afraid. That it couldn't ever
          live up to the France I'd imagined.
          And if it did... Then I'd never be
          able to go home.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And, now?
          Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and
          steps near to kiss him on the lips.

                         ALICE
          But, thank you.
          She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre
          smiles ruefully.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          For everything.
          Alice steps into her room and closes the door.

          Richard exits the plane, walking down a mobile stairway onto
          the tarmac, carrying Alice's repaired suitcase.

          Richard stands at the information counter, conferring with an
          ATTENDANT in his broken French.

                         RICHARD
          Excusez-moi...I'm looking for the
          train. To Monte Carlo.
          Behind him, Cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop
          directly at Richard's back as she searches the terminal and
          hisses into her cellphone.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes, Daddy, I'm here. No, I do not
          see a driver. Yes, I am looking!
          The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit.
          Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the
          attendant corrects him, pointing the other way.

                         RICHARD
          Merci.
           He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a
          UNIFORMED DRIVER approaches Cordelia.

                         DRIVER
          Mademoiselle Scott?

                         CORDELIA
          Where have you been?
          The driver leads her away, neither she nor Richard having
          taken note of the nearby newsstand and its display of today's
          front page: Emma on the yacht wearing Cordelia's necklace.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY

          Meg zooms the moped around the fountain a last loop, Bernard
          on the back, before jerking to a stop in front of the hotel.
          Bernard steadies the moped as Meg climbs off.

                         ME G
          Well, this is me. Back to the old
          Grimaldi suite.

                         (WITH REGRET)

          A beat as they face each other, neither knowing how to end 
          the evening, how to say goodbye.

                         MEG
          Thank your father for me?

                         BERNARD
          I will, Meg.

                         MEG
          Thank you.
          Meg hugs him briefly, awkwardly, then turns for the steps.

                         BERNARD
          Goodbye, Meg.
          Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard.
          Then she turns and marches to him with purpose, seizing his
          face in both her hands and kisses him passionately.
          She releases Bernard, who staggers against the moped,
          catching himself just before going over, as she turns again
          for the steps, an enormous smile on her face.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY

          Alice sits on the edge of the bed with the hotel phone, idly
          looking out at the sparkling bay and anchored boats.

                         ALICE
          (leaving a message)
          Well, I wish you were there. Or
          here. I wish you were here,
          Richard. I do... Because I keep
          thinking, no matter what I see, I'm
          only seeing half of it. Because
          we're not seeing it together...
          Meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom,
          stopping when she overhears Alice on the phone.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Richard. I hope you'll
          be there when I get home...
          Because that's all I want.
          Alice hangs up the phone, so lost in thought she doesn't see
          Meg standing at the door.

          That I hadn't already been to

          the years, and chances I'd had but
          didn't take, they just crashed down
          on me: And I hadn't seen anything
          but the end of Lake Avenue. The
          only clear thought in my head was,

          Of course, they've screwed this up
          as well--. Who else is going?
          The bellhop opens the bedroom doors, revealing the tower of
          Cordelia's luggage, crowned by the reassembled fruit basket.
          Cordelia, unimpressed, indicates the bags the bellhop holds.

          and throwing them wide.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY 

          Cordelia steps to the railing, completely unaware of Alice,
          precariously perched atop the adjacent balcony's railing,
          back pressed against the face of the hotel.

                         CORDELIA

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Stavros is supposed to be here,
          isn't he? I don't see his boat!
          Alice carefully turns to Meg and Emma who look back her with
          desperate faces from the balcony on the far side of Cordelia,
          where they balance with their shopping bags.

          BELLBOY (O.S.)

          Yes?
          He nods, not quite with his hand out, but waiting.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          If you're done, you may go.
          The bellboy turns but hesitates in catching a quick glimpse
          of Alice, fleet as a gazelle, as she passes the open doors on
          the balcony behind Cordelia.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          I said, you can go.
          He bows a retreat, backing out the door.

          Alice climbs across to the next balcony where Meg tries the

          Shopping bags swing up over the edge of the roof, landing in
          profusion, followed by three sets of gripping hands.
          Alice, Meg and Emma haul each other over the hotel's crown,
          the view of the ocean and the yachts in the bay behind them.

          A BOAT DRIVER in uniform passes a captain's hat to Nikolai,

          Meg turns to get a gauge on the distant yacht as she and

          past the front desk and Alice wipes out, tripping over her
          own suitcase on the floor beside Richard.

          Cordelia opens the door to Nikolai, who holds out the room

          No. No. It is robbery. But,
          Mademoiselle Scott said it wasn't.
          Jean-Pierre, checking lists at the ballroom's entrance, notes

          The police captain pounds on the door again, motioning for
          the clerk to use his pass key.

          Mademoiselle? Open this door!

          ALICE (O.S.)
          Coming! Just a moment, please!
          The captain grabs the key from the clerk and turns the
          handle, just as Alice coolly opens the door from within.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Bon jour.

                         EMMA
          Oh, no! This is going to be so
          embarrassing. Please tell me you
          didn't run all the way over here
          just for me.

          Yes, but, Jean-Pierre, would you be
          a dear and help me? I can't seem
          to manage the clasp.
          Jean-Pierre senses something amiss, but steps to assist Emma.

          Nikolai leaps up.

          Alice winces as she sees Richard approaching, at the same
          time Nikolai rushes to Emma.

          Niki, I'm sorry. It's just going

          perpetual anger melts away as she listens, blinks.

          Thank you? You're, you're welcome.
          One of the paparazzi raises his camera to take her picture,
          but another places his hand over the lens.

                         PAPARAZZI
          That's not her. That's the other
          one.

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - TERMINAL GATE - DAY

          Alice sits between Richard and Meg at the departure gate,
          each lost in their own thoughts as TRAVELERS pass to and fro.
          A long beat.
          A small smile finds its way onto Alice's face and she gently
          lowers her head to rest it on Richard's shoulder.
          Richard finds Alice's hand and squeezes it in his own.

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - JETWAY - DAY

          Meg walks down the jetway in her skinny jeans, a bounce in 
          her step, shopping bags in one hand, the bottle of wine
          gripped in the other, as though headed for a party.
          Behind her, Alice carries her shopping bags and Richard totes
          Alice's suitcase.

          ALICE (V.0.)
          "I used to wander aimlessly,/
          Wanton my goal, grievous my
          plight./Your dear hands led me,
          guided me."
          Alice encircles Richard's waist as they walk, and he slings
          an arm around her shoulder, kisses her hair.

          A YOUNG GIRL presents a length of brightly woven fabric,
          draping it over Emma's shoulders as Emma picks the girl up
          and the other children lead Emma and Nikolai inside.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          A bulletin board in Meg's classroom is covered in African
          fabric, photographs and letters, all under a banner that
          reads: Food Drive for Our Sister School - Zambia.
          The two students who had cooked their pot holders sort canned
          goods beneath the board, while Meg cooks, surrounded by the
          rest of her CLASS.

          A STUDENT carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon,
          holding it out for Meg to add to her pan.
          She ignores the spoon, instead reaching to pinch some spice
          with her fingers and encourages the student who follows her
          example.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          Alice moves freely around the center of the circle of desks
          her STUDENTS have formed, reciting by memory.

                         ALICE
          "Yes, my heart - dark, cowed, set
          apart,/Alone - bewailed its dire
          distress./Sweet love, with its all-
          conquering art."
          The entire classroom hangs on her every word.

          "Joined us as one in joyousness."
          A beat as she and her class float on the last phrase of Paul

[Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops
down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands
on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One
grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge
and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him]

Guard [yelling]:  We're under attack!  Light the signal!

[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long
Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with
his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to
light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at
him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron
lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons
one by one]

Guard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you're here.

Shan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect.

[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li
walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. 
He bows, then looks up]

General Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.

Chi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor
motions for Chi Fu's silence]

General Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your
palace immediately.

Emperor [forcefully]:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu, 

Chi Fu:  Yes, your highness.

Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up
reserves and as many new recruits as possible.

General Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.

Emperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip
the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.

[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the
mound of rice]

Mulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her
chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets
down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual.
[A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit-
ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart
boy, can you help me with my chores today?

[Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist.  She ties a stick
onto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. 
She ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother
begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for
Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. 
Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse]

[Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's
ancestors]

Fa Zhou:  Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today. 


Little Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain
around the floor]: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

[The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the
grain]

Fa Zhou:  Please, PLEASE, help her.

[Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to
get the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the
bone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the
temple]

Mulan [calling out]: Father I brought your--whoop!  [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan. 
The cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of
his cane]

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan:  I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of
her dress and begins to pour the tea]  

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan [hurried]: Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning--

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan:  And three at night. 

Fa Zhou:  Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up--

Mulan:  --uphold the family honor.  Don't worry father.  I wont let you down. 
[Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve]  Wish me luck. 
[Mulan hurries down the stairs]

Fa Zhou [calling out]:  Hurry!  [to himself] I'm going to...pray some more.
[Fa Zhou turns and walks back into the temple]

[Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried]

Bath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? 
The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building]

Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for
luck.

Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be,
they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to
Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. 
Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]

Fa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No!

[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two
horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other
side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee]

Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of
fright]

Fa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai.

[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and
jumps off with hay stuck in her hair]

Mulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had
to--

Fa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk
together into the preparation area]

[Song: Honor to us all]

Bath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the
Bath]
This is what you give me 
to work with?
Well, honey, I've seen worse.
We're gonna turn 
this sow's ear
Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in
the bath] 

Mulan [spoken]:  It's freezing.

Fa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time.  

Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]:
We'll have you
Washed and dried
Primped and polished 
till you glow with pride
Trust my recipe for 
instant bride
You'll bring honor to us all

Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She
notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this?

Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes,
in case I forget something?

Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll
need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment]

[Cut to the hair dressers]

Hair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin]:
Wait and see
When we're through

Hair Dresser 2:
Boys will gladly go to 
war for you

Hair Dresser 1:
With good fortune 

Hair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]:
And a great hairdo

Both:
You'll bring honor to us all

Fa Li and others:  [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and
pauses to make an impressive move.  Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa
Li comes back and drags Mulan away]
A girl can bring her family
Great honor in one way
By striking a good match
And this could be the day

Dresser 1 [Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan]:
Men want girls 
with good taste

Dresser 2:
Calm

Fa Li:
Obedient

Dresser 1:
Who work fast-paced

Fa Li:
With good breeding

Dresser 2 [Pulling the dress tight around her waist]:
And a tiny waist 

Mulan [expressing her waist being squeezed tight] [spoken]: huh.

All Three:
You'll bring honor to us all 

Chorus:  [Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan
grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner]
We all must serve 
our Emperor
Who guards us from the Huns
A man by bearing arms
A girl by bearing sons 

Make-up Lady/Fa Li: [Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye liner]
[in a 3 person round]
 When we're through 
you can't fail
Like a lotus blossom 
soft and pale
How could any fellow 
say "No sale"
You'll bring honor to us all
[Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her reflection.  Not looking
pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her
forehead and smiles]

Fa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair]:  There, you're
ready.

Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in
Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her
sash] [sings]

Beads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck]
You must proudly show it [Grandma Fa raises her chin high with her hand]
Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's
sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased]
And even you can't blow it

Mulan:  [Walking to catch up with the other maidens]
Ancestors
Hear my plea
Help me not to make a fool of me
And to not uproot my fam'ly tree
Keep my father standing tall

Maidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall
in line with the other 4 maidens]
Scarier than the undertaker
We are meeting our 
matchmaker

All Townspeople:
Destiny
Guard our girls
And our future 
as it fast unfurls
Please look kindly on 
these cultured pearls
Each a perfect porcelain doll

Maiden #1:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #2:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #3:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #4:  Please bring honor to us
Mulan and Maidens:  Please bring honor to us all! 

[All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their
parasols.  End of song]

Matchmaker [looking at her clipboard]:  Fa Mulan

Mulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]:  Present.

Matchmaker:  Speaking without permission.

Mulan:  Oops. 

Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  Who spit in her bean curd?

[Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following
behind and closing the door]

Matchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from
his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. 
[Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her]
Recite the final admonition.

Mulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as
she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu

Matchmaker:  Well...

Mulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her
arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised,
Mulan looks at her arm again] act.  [now rapidly] This shall bring you honor
and glory.  [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief] Huh.

Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes
not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker
grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and
leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a
teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a
sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at
Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours
the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan
notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup]

Mulan [quiet and timid]:  Um, pardon me.

Matchmaker:  And silent! [Matchmaker sniffs the tea]

Mulan [reaching and grabbing the teacup]:  Could I just take that back...one
moment.

[They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee
jumps down matchmaker's dress]

Matchmaker:  Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances
around]  Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and
sits down on the coals.  Matchmaker jumps around screaming]  Ahhhhhhhhhhh 
[Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind
causing it to flame up.  Mulan looks surprised about her mistake]

[Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming
from Matchmaker's building]

Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  I think it's going well, don't you?

Matchmaker [running out of the building screaming]:  Put it out! Put it out! 
Put it out! [Mulan takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out
the fire.  She bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face
as she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa] [with anger]  You are a disgrace! 
[Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to pieces]  You may look like a
bride, but you will never bring your family honor!

[The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away]

[Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan.  She looks
sorrowful.  Fa Zhou sees his daughter and smiles.  Mulan sees her father's
smile.  She covers her face with Khan's head and leads him to the water
trough]

[Song: Reflection]

Mulan: 
Look at me [looking at her reflection in the water trough]
I will never pass for 
a perfect bride [taking off her earrings and beads of jade]
Or a perfect daughter [Mulan watches Fa Li relating what happened at the
Matchmaker's to Fa Zhou]
Can it be
I'm not meant to play 
this part?  [Mulan releases Cri-Kee back to the wild]
Now I see
That if I were to truly
To be myself [Mulan hops along the bridge railing]
I would break my 
family's heart

Who is that girl I see  [Mulan looks into the pond and sees her own
reflection]
Staring straight
Back at me? [Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward
the temple]
Why is my reflection someone 
I don't know? [Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily pad]
Somehow I cannot hide [Mulan walking into the family temple]
Who I am [Cri-Kee watches Mulan in the temple seeing multiple reflections of
herself in the ancestors' stones]
Though I've tried  [Mulan bows to the ancestors]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?  [Mulan finishes wiping off her make-up seeing her reflection
in the stones]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside? [Mulan gets up and heads out the temple]

[End of song.  Mulan sits on a bench under the blossom tree.  Fa Zhou
approaches her, clearing his throat.  Mulan sees him approaching and turns her
head away.  Fa Zhou sits down beside Mulan]

Fa Zhou:  My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into
the blossom tree].  But look, this one's late.  But, I'll bet that when it
blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.  [Mulan and Fa Zhou share
smiles.  Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards
on horseback]

Mulan:  What is it?

[Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan
following]

Fa Li:  Mulan, stay inside.

[Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. 
Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof]

Chi Fu:  Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the
Huns have invaded China! 

Townspeople [expressing surprise]:  No!

Chi Fu:  By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the
Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard
and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family.

Yi's Son [holding his old father back]:  I will serve the Emperor in my
father's place.

Chi Fu:  The Fa Family.

Mulan:  No.

[Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before
the horsemen]

Fa Zhou [standing proud]:  I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches
for the conscription notice]

Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription
notice]:  Father, you can't go.

Fa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]:  Mulan!

Mulan:  Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--

Chi Fu:  Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue
in a man's presence.

Fa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]:  Mulan, you dishonor me.

[Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away]

Chi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]:  Report tomorrow at the Wu
Shu camp.

Fa Zhou:  Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take
his cane from Fa Li]

Chi Fu [fading out as we follow Fa Zhou]:  The Chu family.  The Wen family. 
The Chang family.  The...

[Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night.  Fa Zhou takes out his sword and
practices his stances.  Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts
up and he falls.  Unbeknownst to her father, Mulan watches in horror.  She
breathes heavily]

[Cut to dinner.  The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. 
Thunder can be heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. 
Mulan pours the tea for her family.  She slams her teacup down on the table
and stands up]

Mulan:  You shouldn't have to go.

Fa Li:  Mulan!

Mulan:  There are plenty of young men to fight for China.

Fa Zhou:  It is an honor to protect my country and my family.

Mulan [angrily]:  So you'll die for honor!

Fa Zhou [standing up and angered]:  I will DIE doing what's right.

Mulan [starts to speak but is cut off]: But if you--

Fa Zhou:  I know my place, it is time you learned yours.

[Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs
outside into the rain storm and cries]

[Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. 
Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She
watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks
out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa
Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights
incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to
her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and
hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and
takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave
to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries
out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. 
Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her
head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes
the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the
stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes
forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out
of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes
one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the
gate and off to camp.]

[Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.  Cut to
Grandma Fa.  She wakes up with a start rising in bed.  Cut to Grandma Fa
walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's bedroom, both are in bed]

Grandma Fa:  Mulan is gone.

Fa Zhou [waking up]:  What?  It can't be.  [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand
and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the
cabinet and sees his armor is gone.  He hurries outside] [calling out]  Mulan! 
[He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury] No.

Fa Li [kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou]:  You must go after her.  She
could be killed!

Fa Zhou [sadly]:  If I reveal her, she will be. [Fa Zhou embraces Fa Li]

Grandma Fa:  Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan.

[Cut to the Fa Family Temple.  A wind blows out the incense at the base of the
center stone.  The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to
life]

First Ancestor [motioning to a bronze dragon]:  Mushu, awaken!

[Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being
obscured by smoke]

Mushu [rising from the smoke arms stretched out]:  I live!  So tell me what
mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor.  You just say the word and I'm
there.

First Ancestor [agitated]:  Mushu!

Mushu:  Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten
our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr.

First Ancestor [sternly to silence Mushu]:  Mushu!  These are the family
guardians [motioning towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling]. 
They...

Mushu [dejectedly]:  Protect the family.

First Ancestor [pointing to the empty pedestal]:  And you, oh demoted one.

Mushu:  I...ring the gong.

First Ancestor:  That's right, now, wake up the ancestors.

Mushu:  One family reunion coming right up.  [ringing the gong] Okay people,
people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine. 
You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me!

Ancestor 1:  I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the
start.

Ancestor 3:  Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family.

Ancestor 2:  She's just trying to help her father.

Ancestor 4 [appearing out of thin air]:  But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou
will be forever shamed.  Dishonor will come to the family.  Traditional values
will disintegrate.

Ancestor 5:  Not to mention they'll lose the farm.

Ancestor 1:  My children never caused such trouble.  They all became
acupuncturists.

Ancestor 3:  Well, We can't all be acupuncturists.

Ancestor 6:  No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!

[All ancestors argue at once, except First Ancestor]

Ancestor 7:  Let a guardian bring her back.  

Ancestor 8 [grabbing Mushu and bringing him next to a guardian]: Yeah, awaken
the most cunning.

Ancestor 4 [taking Mushu and holding him next to the stone rabbit guardian]: 
No, the swiftest.

Ancestor 9 [grabbing Mushu and holding him next to the stone monkey guardian]: 
No, send the wisest.

First Ancestor:  Silence!  We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to
the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window]

Mushu [climbs up the empty guardian post laughing]:  Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay,
okay, I get the drift, I'll go. [All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise
and laugh uncontrollably]  You all don't think I can do it.  Watch this here. 
[Mushu produces a small flame from his mouth]  Ah, ha, Jump back, I'm pretty
hot huh.  Don't make me have to singe nobody to prove no point.

First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling away from the post]:  You had your
chance to protect the Fa family.

Ancestor 6:  Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.

Fa Deng [with his decapitated head on his lap]:  Yeah, thanks a lot.

Mushu:  And your point is?

First Ancestor:  The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve
Mulan.

Mushu:  What?  But I'm a real dragon.

First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as
Mushu fights to hold on]:  You are not worthy of this spot.  Now, awaken the
Great Stone Dragon.  [First Ancestor throws Mushu out of the temple]

Mushu [looking back into the temple]:  So you'll get back to me on the job
thing.

[An ancestor throws Mushu's gong and hits Mushu in the face]

Mushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]:  Just one
chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya.

Mushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]:  Yo rocky, wake
up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over
to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong
stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the
Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear
with the gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard
against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon
crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's
head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me!

First Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]:  Great Stone Dragon,
have you awaken? 

Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor
can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I
am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning [Mushu waves].  I will go forth and
fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon?

First Ancestor:  Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws.

Mushu:  Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down
the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the
dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him]

Mushu [muffled]:  Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. 
[Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And
all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road.

[Cri-Kee enters stage right]

Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp.

Mushu:  Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone
Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the
temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be
begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and
done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right]

Cri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]:  Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp.

Mushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]:  Hey, what makes you think you're coming?

Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. 

Mushu:  You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you?

Cri-Kee:  Chirp. Chirp.

Mushu:  Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and
throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you?

[Interlude]

[Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. 
He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair
Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts
before the rest of the army]

Hun Long-Hair Guy:  Imperial scouts. 

[Shan Yu dismounts and walks towards the scouts]

Scout #1:  Shan-Yu.

[He crouches down in front of them]

Shan-Yu [adjusting Scout #1's collar]:  Nice work, gentlemen.  You found the
Hun army. [motioning to the soldiers on horseback.  The Hun army laughs]

Scout #2:  The Emperor will stop you.

Shan-Yu [grabs Scout #2 by the shirt collar and lifts him up to his face]: 
Stop me?  He invited me.  By building his wall, he challenged my strength. 
Well I'm here to play his game  [Shan-Yu throws Scout #2 to the ground and
points his sword at Scout #1 as he gets up and runs] [calling out to the
scouts] Go!  Tell your emperor to send his strongest armies.  [Quietly]  I'm
ready. 

[The Imperial Scouts run off towards the palace]

Shan-Yu [scratching his chin]:  How many men does it take to deliver a
message.

Archer Guy [drawing back his bow]:  One.

[End Interlude]

[Cut to Mulan on a hill outside of the camp.  Khan is sitting watching]

Mulan:  Okay, okay, how 'bout this?  Ahem, [in her manly voice] excuse me,
where do I sign in?  Hah, I see you have a sword.  I have one too.  They're
very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword
out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground.  Khan rolls on his back in
laughter.  Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting
Khan].  I'm working on it.  Who am I fooling?  It's going to take a miracle to
get me into the army.

[Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either
side.  Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight]

Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]:  Did I hear someone ask for a
miracle!?  Let me hear you say aye!

Mulan [Running and hiding behind a rock]:  Ahhhhhh.

Mushu:  That's close enough.

Mulan [from behind a rock]:  Ghost.

Mushu:  Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.  For I have
been sent by your ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a
dragon on the rock and stamps him down with his foot] to guide you through
your masquerade.  [bending down to Cri-Kee]  C'mon, you're gonna stay you're
gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out
that you are a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the
rocks]

Mulan:  Who are you?

Mushu:  Who am I?  Who am I?  I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles
big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the
pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real
size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan
pushes Khan back]

Mulan:  Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?

Mushu:  Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips
out his tongue to show Mulan what he means].

Mulan:  You're uh...

Mushu:  Intimidating?  Awe inspiring?

Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny.

Mushu [with a look of disappointment]:  Of course.  I'm travel size for your
convenience.  If I was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose]
would die of fright.  [Khan tries to bite Mushu]  [pointing to the ground
speaking to Khan] Down Bessy.  My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. 
For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can see
straight through your armor.  [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and
slaps Mushu with the right]  Ow.  [angrily] All right, that's it!  Dishonor! 
Dishonor on your whole family.  [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note of this
[Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing].  [Loudly with gusto]
Dishonor on you.  Dishonor on your cow.  Dis-

Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]:  Stop!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
[kneeling down in front of Mushu].  I'm just nervous.  I've never done this
before.

Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me.  And don't you slap me no more, we
clear on that?  [Mulan nods emphatically].  All right.  Okey dokey, let's get
this show on the road.  Cri-Kee, get the bags [Mushu starts walking to the
camp].  [to Khan] Let's move it heifer.

[Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance]

Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]:  Okay this
is it, time to show 'em your man walk.  Shoulders back,  chest high, feet
apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back]  ...and strut 2, 3, break it
down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the attention the
men who see her.  Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and
another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful
isn't it?

Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]:  They're disgusting.

Mushu:  No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so
pay attention.

[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier]

Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]:  Look, this
tattoo will protect me from harm.

[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing
Ling to laugh.  Mulan watches in utter amazement.  Yao kisses his hand]

Ling [laughing]:  I hope you can get your money back.

Mulan:  I don't think I can do this.

Mushu:  It's all attitude.  Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao].

[Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits]

Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]:  What are you looking at?

Mushu:  Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'

[Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder.  The
force causes Yao to run into Chien-Po]

Chien-Po:  Oh Yao, you made a friend.

Mushu:  Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.

[Mulan slaps Yao on the behind]

Yao:  Wu hoo hooooo.  [grabbing Mulan buy the collar]  I'm going to hit you so
hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

Chien-Po [Holding and picking up Yao]:  Yao, relax and chant with me. 
Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa.
 Yao:  Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da.

Chien-Po:  Feel better? 

Yao [relaxed]:  Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground]  [to Mulan
while walking away] Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy.

Mushu [loudly]:  Chicken boy!?  Say that to my face ya limp noodle!

[Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch.  Mulan ducks as
Yao hits Ling standing behind her]

Yao:  Oh, sorry Ling.  Hey!

[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump
attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po]

Ling:  You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes.

[Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a
soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line
of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who
has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew]

Mulan:  Hey guys.  

[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent.  General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.]

General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]:  The Huns have struck here, here and here.  I will take the main troops up to
the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village.

Chi Fu:  Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha.

General Li:  You will stay here and train the new recruits.  When Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands
a sword to Shang]

Shang:  Captain?

Chi Fu:  Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General.  Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience--

General Li:  Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressive
military lineage.  I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job.

Shang [excitedly]:  Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir.

General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]:  Very good then.  We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City.  [to Chi Fu] I'll
expect a full report in three weeks.

Chi Fu [to Shang]:  And I wont leave anything out.  [exits through the tent]

Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]:  Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time. 
Heh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit
sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse]

Chi Fu:  Most impressive.

General Li:  Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp]

Shang [quietly, to himself]:  Good luck, Father.  [Shang looks at his troops and sighs]

Chi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]:  Day one.

Shang [shouting]:  Soldiers!

All Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her.  Mulan is crouching in the fetal position on the ground]:  He started it!

[Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her.  Mulan looks up, sees Shang over top of her and gets up quickly dusting herself off]

Shang [to Mulan]:  I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!

Mulan:  Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.  [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder]  You know how it is
when you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cook
outdoors.

Shang:  What's your name?

Mulan [stumbling]:  Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--

Chi Fu [stepping into Mulan's face]:  Your commanding officer just asked you a question.

Mulan:  Uhh, I've got a name.  Huh.  And it's a boys name too.

Mushu [from the back of Mulan]:  Ling, How 'bout Ling?

Mulan [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]:  His name's Ling.

Shang:  I didn't ask for his name.  I asked for yours.

Mushu:  Try, uh, ahh, Chu!

Mulan:  Ah Chu.

Shang:  Ah Chu?

Mushu:  Gesundheit.  He He, I kill myself.

Mulan [whispering over her shoulder]:  Mushu.

Shang:  Mushu?

Mulan:  No.

Shang:  Then what is it!

Mushu:  Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up!

Mulan:  It's Ping.

Shang:  Ping.

Mushu:  Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth together]

Mulan:  Yes, my name is Ping.

Shang:  Let me see your conscription notice.  [Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?

Chi Fu:  I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

Mulan:  Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The
recruits laugh]

Chi Fu:  I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic.

Shang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And
tomorrow, the real work begins.

[All recruits growl at Mulan]

Mushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]:  You know, we have to work on your people skills.

[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent.  Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings.  Cri-Kee rings like an alarm clock]

Mushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup,
hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on. 
Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see
you.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey,
get outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]

Mulan:  Am I late?

Mushu [while feeding Mulan]:  No time to talk.  Now remember, it's your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play
nice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt.

Mulan [with her mouth full of food]:  But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.

Mushu:  Don't talk with your mouth full.  Now let's see your war face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]. 
I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C'mon scare me, girl! 

Mulan [swallows the food]:  Rrrrrrr!

Mushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]:  Oh, that's my tough looking warrior.  That's what I'm talking about.  Now get out
there and make me proud. [Mushu ties up Mulan's hair]

[Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent]

Mushu:  What do you mean the troops just left?  

Mulan [acting surprised]:  They what!? [Mulan hurriedly puts on her clothes and jumps out of the tent going off to join the other recruits]  

Mushu [running out from the tent calling after Mulan]:  Wait, you forgot your sword.  My little baby off to destroy people [sniffle].

[Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang's tent]

Chi Fu [enters stage left]:  Order people, order!

Recruit #2:  I'd like a pan fried noodle.

Chien-Po:  Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin to laugh]

Recruit #3:  Moo goo gai pan

Chi Fu:  That's not funny.

[Mulan comes running up to the group]

Ling [noticing Mulan's arrival]:  Looks like our new friend slept in this morning.  [Mulan stops between Ling and Yao] [to Ping] Hellooo Ping,
Are you hungry?

Yao:  Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with
her hands.  Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]

All Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]:  Yeah.

Shang [loudly]:  Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly
impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who
acts otherwise will answer to me.

Yao:  Ooooo, tough guy.

Shang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]:  Yao.  [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang
Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow.

Yao [bows to Shang]:  I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.  [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole]

Shang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it
high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's
arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while
Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow.

[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her
behind as she walks away in front of Shang]

Shang:  We've got a long way to go.

[Song I'll Make a Man Out of You]

[Shang throws staffs to the soldiers.  Yao intercepts Mulan's staff and trips her with it]

Shang:
Let's get down to business--
to defeat the Huns.

[Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff.  The troops are highly impressed]

Recruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]:  Hua

Shang:
Did they send me daughters
 when I asked for sons?  [Ling puts a cricket down Mulan's back causing her to flail erratically]
You're the saddest bunch
 I ever met  [Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves uncontrollably]
But you can bet 
before we're through  [Shang does a somersault in the air landing near Mulan.  He takes a pole in the stomach.  Shang stops Mulan and
takes her staff.  He grabs her by the collar]
Mister, I'll make a man
 out of you 

[Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow]
Tranquil as a forest
[The recruits try and fail.  Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a target on her arrow before she shoots.  Mulan looks at Mushu's in
shock and pauses.  Shang looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile]
But on fire within
[Shang balances a bucket of water on his head holding a staff.  The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the staff]
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
[Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on her head.  As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head]
You're a spineless, pale,
pathetic lot 
And you haven't got a clue 
[Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot.  Mushu
comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan]
Somehow I'll make a man
out of you!

Chien-Po [running through a field of fire arrows]:
I'm never gonna catch 
my breath

Yao [following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with an arrow]:
Say good-bye to those 
who knew me

Ling [Banging his head on a stone slab]:
Boy I was a fool in school 
for cutting gym

[Shang practices martial arts with Mulan.  With a punch to the face he knocks her back into a tree]

Mushu [from the tree acts as a boxing coach]:
This guy's got 'em 
scared to death

Mulan [Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring]:
Hope he doesn't see 
right through me

Chien-Po [stops as he's hopping across poles protruding from water causing Shang and the recruits to pile into him]:
Now I really wish that I 
knew how to swim!

Shang and Chorus:  
[Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open field. Ling kicks the support structure out from Mulan's cannon and it begins to fall.
Mulan quickly grabs the cannon and it fires high and back towards the camp landing and exploding Chi Fu's tent]
(Be a man)
We must be swift as 
the coursing river
(Be a man)
With all the force 
of a great typhoon
(Be a man)
With all the strength 
of a raging fire
[Picture of Shang looking over the camp from the hill not looking pleased]
Mysterious as the 
dark side of the moon 

Shang [his troops laden with poles on their shoulders carrying bags of grain - one on each side.  They march up a mountain]:
Time is racing toward us 
till the Huns arrive  
[Chi Fu points Shang's eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the ground.  Cri-Kee and Mushu try to pick her up but hide when Shang
comes up to her.  Shang picks up her pole with grain, puts it on top of his and returns to the troops. Mulan looks rejected]
Heed my every order 
and you might survive
[Shang hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan]
You're unsuited for 
the rage of war
So pack up, go home, 
you're through
How could I make a man
out of you?

Shang and Chorus [Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb the pole again]:
(Be a man)
We must be swift as 
the coursing river
[Mulan ties the weights together behind the pole and uses the cloth to help her shimmy up the pole]
(Be a man)
With all the force 
of a great typhoon
[As the sun begins to rise the recruits come out of their tents to cheer on Mulan]
(Be a man)
With all the strength 
of a raging fire
[As Shang comes out of his tent, the arrow he shot up onto the pole comes down to his feet.  He looks up and sees Mulan sitting on top of
the pole]
Mysterious as the 
dark side of the moon

[order of events during the last repeat of the chorus:
Troops hit all targets with arrows correctly.

[End Song]

[Interlude]

[Cut to Shan Yu sitting on top of a tree.  He cuts off the very top with his sword.  His falcon swoops buy and drops a doll.  Shan-Yu takes
the doll, sniffs it, looks surprised, and drops down to the ground]

Shan-Yu [tossing the doll to Hun Strong Man]:  What do you see?

Hun Strong Man [feeling the doll]:  Black pine, from the high mountains.  [Long Hair Hun Man takes the doll from Hun Strong Man.  Bald
Hun Man #1 takes a hair as it passes by him]

Bald Hun Man #1:  White horse hair.  Imperial stallions.  

Long Hair Hun Man [sniffing the doll]:  Sulfur, from cannons.

Shan-Yu:  This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the Imperial Army's waiting for us.

Hun Archer:  We can avoid them easily.

Shan-Yu [shaking his head]:  No, the quickest way to the Emperor is through that pass.  Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll.  We
should return it to her.

[End Interlude]

[Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee]

Mushu:  Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you?

Mulan [from behind the reeds]:  Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one.  

Mushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]:  So a couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky.  Well myself I
kinda like that corn chip's smell.

Mulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu]:  Ahhhhhhh.

Mushu:   Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan
keeping his eyes covered].

Mulan:   Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch.

Mushu:  Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid
girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene.

Cri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]:  Chirp, Chirp.

Yao:  Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers]

Mushu [gasps]:  Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice!

[Yao and Ling jump into the water.  Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave.  Yao and Ling ride
the wave towards Mulan.  Mulan sees them and hides her face behind a lily pad]

Yao [calling]:  Hey, Ping.

[Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest]

Mulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]:  Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share
"this boy is strange" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go.  Bye, bye.  [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front
facing the rock]

Ling [from behind Mulan]:  Come back here.  I know we were jerks to you before so lets start over.  [extending his hand to shake hands with
Mulan]  Hi, I'm Ling!

Mulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an outstretched right arm, smiling]:  Heh, heh.  [Mulan turns
and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po]

Chien-Po [taking a lily pad off his head]:  And I'm Chien-Po.

Mulan [waving slightly and smiling]:  Hello Chien-Po.

[Yao stands on top of a rock looking down at the others.  Mulan looks down into the water and hides her eyes with her free hand]

Yao:  And I am Yao, king of the rock.  And there's nothin' you girls can do about it.

Ling [taking a fighting stance]:  Oh, yeah?  Well, I think Ping [elbowing Mulan] and I could take you.

Mulan [wading away]:  I really don't want to take him anywhere.

Ling [following Mulan]:  Ping, we have to fight!

Mulan:  No we don't. [unnaturally]  We could just close our eyes and swim around.

Ling: C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch!  Something bit me.

Mushu [popping out of the water between Mulan and Ling]:  What a nasty flavor.

Ling [with fear and gusto]:  Snake!  

Chien-Po [while all three of them climb up the rock and on each other]: Snake, snake.

[Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore.  Khan comes close enough to shore and Mulan hides behind Khan as she wraps a towel
around her body]

[Cut to Yao, Ling and Chien-Po calmed down sitting on the rock]

Ling:  Some king of the rock!  [Yao pushes him off the rock]

[Cut to Mulan with towel wrapped around her]

Mulan:  Boy, that was close.

Mushu [brushing his teeth]:  No, that was vile!  You owe me big!

Mulan:  I never want to see a naked man again.  [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump into the lake]

Mushu:  Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts.

[Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully.  Chi Fu and Shang are talking from inside]

Chi Fu [fading in]:  You think your troops are ready to fight?  Hah!  They would not last a minute against the Huns.  

Shang:  They completed their training.

Chi Fu:  Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never
see battle.

Mushu [from outside the tent]:  Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war. [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing with my
plan.

Shang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]:  We're not finished.

Chi Fu [pulling the board away]:  Be careful, Captain.  The General may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council.  And, oh, by the
way, huh, I got that job on my own.  [opens the entrance to the tent for Shang] You're dismissed.

[Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan]

Mulan [in a manly voice]:  Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh...  [Shang walks by without reacting] or not.  [calling out to Shang] 
For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.  [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward]

Mushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]:  I saw that!

Mulan [innocently]:  What?

Mushu [teasing]:  You like him don't you?

Mulan:  No, I--

Mushu:  Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,  [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to
Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands [rubbing hands together].

[Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big
showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He
finishes and Mushu takes the paper]

Mushu:  Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up.  [sarcastically]  That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't
mind bringing up some."  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts
writing the note again]  That's better, much better.  [taking the note] Okay, Let's go.

[Cut to Khan drinking water from the trough.  Mushu is on his back]

Mushu:  Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride.  [Khan squirts Mushu off his back with water from his mouth]

[Cut to Chi Fu walking out of the lake wrapped in a towel, sounds of laughter can be heart from the troops]

Chi Fu [muttering]:  Insubordinate ruffians.  [then calling to the troops]  You men owe me a new pair of slippers.  And I do not squeal like a
girl.  [a panda bear chomps down on the slipper Chi Fu is holding] Aaaaaahhhhhh!

Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the note
towards Chi Fu.  Cri-Kee works the mouth]:  Urgent news from the general!  [Chi Fu looks over the panda]  What's the matter, you've never
seen a 'black and white' before?

Chi Fu:  Who are you?

Mushu:  Excuse me!  I think the question is: who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your
hat for that, [the panda starts walking forward] snatch it right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper
half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message].  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on
before I report you.  [the panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight]

Chi Fu [looking around for Mushu but not finding him, then runs into Shang's tent]:  Captain.  Urgent news from the General.  We're needed
at the front.

Mushu [from up in the tree]:  Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' out.  [Cri-Kee high fives Mushu]

[Song:  A Girl Worth Fighting For]

Army Chorus [troops walking up hill]:
For a long time we've been 
marching off to battle

Yao [close-up of Yao, then a shot of 2 cows]: 
In a thundering herd 
we feel a lot like cattle

Cow [spoken]:  Moo

Army Chorus [showing troops marching]:
Like the pounding beat 
our aching feet aren't 
easy to ignore

Ling [catching up to Yao and Chien-Po]:
Hey, think of instead,
A girl worth fighting for [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look upwards dreamily]

Mulan [spoken from behind]: Huh?

Ling [grabbing Mulan and drawing her close while pulling out a centerfold]:
That's what I said, a girl 
worth fighting for [Mulan runs away seeing the centerfold]

[artistry section where the images are drawn like painted people.  Ling is seen looking at a woman and then kissing her]
I want her paler than the 
moon with eyes that 
shine like stars

Yao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through]:
My girl will marvel at 
my strength, adore my 
battle scars

Chien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl of rice as a cow, pig and chicken fall beside them]:
I couldn't care less what she'll 
wear or what she looks like
It all depends on what 
she cooks like:
Beef, pork, chicken... [end painted people section, the last image fades into statues that the troops just passed]

All Three:
Mmm...

Yao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over their heads.  Mulan looks disgusted and hurries forward]:
Bet the local girls thought 
you were quite the charmer

Ling [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]:
And I'll bet the ladies love 
a man in armor [the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self]

Army Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of the carriage holding cannons.  Cri-Kee looks shocked.  The
ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]:
You can guess what we 
have missed the most 
since we went off 
to war
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for!

Yao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]:
My girl will think I have 
no faults

Chien-Po:
That I'm a major find

Mulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily waiting for her ideal woman.  She is forced to speak (sing)]:
[spoken] Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's 
got a brain,  [Yao starts to look unimpressed]
Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs her shoulders]

Ling, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and disgusted]: Nah!

Ling [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and shakes her head disapprovingly.  Ling leans against the
carriage of cannons]:
My manly ways and turns of 
phrase are sure to thrill her

Yao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling.  Ling looks upset then falls in the mud]:
He thinks he's such a 
lady-killer!

Chi Fu:
I've a girl back home who's 
unlike any other.

Yao [aside to Mulan]:
Yeah, the only girl who'd 
love him is his mother! [Mulan smiles]

Army Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders with Mulan in the middle to her discontent]:
But when we come home 
in victory they'll line up 
at the door!

Ling [sitting on top of Chien-Po]:
What do we want?

Army Chorus:
A girl worth fighting for!

Ling:
Wish that I had

Army Chorus [Mulan breaks away and walks in the opposite direction of the army]:
A girl worth fighting for!
(whistle) [Mulan sees Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po with snowballs about to pelt her so she turns around] 
A girl worth fighting--

[All have stunned looks on their faces]

[End Song]

[Cut to ruins of a burned out village.  The soldiers walk through the singed gate and look around at the few planks that remain from the
buildings]

Shang [from mounted horse]:  Search for survivors.

[Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village.  She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully.  Shang
comes to her side]

Shang:  I don't understand.  My father should have been here.

Chi Fu [calling out from the top of a hill overlooking a valley]:  Captain!  

[Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen.  Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying face
down, broken cannon carts.  Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley.  Chien-Po
walks up from the valley carrying a helmet]

Chien-po [handing the helmet to Shang]:  ...the General.

[Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill.  He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright.  He kneels down and
places the helmet on top of the sword.  Mulan approaches him from behind]

Mulan [softly]:  I'm sorry.

[Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by.  Shang walks to the center of the troops. He grabs his
horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse]

Shang:  The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the
Emperor now.  Move out!

[Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword.  She turns around and joins the rest of
the troops marching on]

[Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The
troops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu
points at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]

Shang [angrily]:  What happened?!

Mulan [stumbling]:  Uhhh--

Shang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the
arrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!!

[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows
start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]

Shang:  Save the cannons!

[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him
from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan
free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet
and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.

Mushu:  Oh sure, save the horse.

[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao,
Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]

Shang:  Fire!

[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides]

Shang:  Fire!

[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming
from the mountain position]

Shang:  Hold the last cannon.  [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.  Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare
to fight.  If we die, we die with honor.

[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on
Shan-Yu's war cry  The Hun army follows]

Shang:  Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.

[The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow
embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward]

Yao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]:  Hey.
 Shang:  Ping, come back.  Ping!

[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the
oncoming horde with worry in his eyes]

Shang [starting to run after her waving his arms]:  Stop!

[Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang]

Mushu [seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position]:  All right, you might want to light that right about now.  Quickly!  Quickly!

[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock]

Yao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]:  C'mon, we've gotta help.  [they charge towards Mulan's position]

[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands
on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]

Mushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]:  You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in
front of you!

[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and
Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]

Shan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]:  Yrrrrrrraah.  

[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. 
Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his
horse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him
around and helping him run away from the avalanche]

Yao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]:  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn
around and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa!

[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up
Shan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She
grabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow]

[Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.  They see the snow approaching close and run to larger shelter where the rest of
Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches their posision]

[Cut to Mushu riding down the snow on a shield]

Mushu [calling out]:  Mulan!  Mulan!  [seeing hair sticking up from the snow] Mulan?  [Mushu picks up the Hun by the hair]

Hun Soldier:  Arrrrr.

Mushu [pushing the hun soldier back under the snow]:  Nope.  Mulan!  [Mushu picks up Cri-Kee out of the snow]  Man, you are one lucky
bug.

[Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche.  Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemerge
quickly.  She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow]

Mulan [calling loudly]:  Shang, Shang!  [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang's position.  She picks him up and places him on Khan.  She
turns Khan around again to be riding upstream]

[Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling]

Chien-Po:  Do you see them?

Yao [extatically]:  Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached]  Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope
completely passed through his hands]--ty.

[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield]

Mushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]:  Hey Mulan, I found a lucky
cricket.

Mulan [speaking loudly]:  We need help!  [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan]

Mushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they're about to fall
over the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We're gonna die!  We're gonna die!  I know we're gonna die!  No way we can
survive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao]

Yao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers
grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]

Yao:  Pull

[Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu
and Cri-Kee to safety]

Mushu:  I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces]

[The soldiers help them up to the cliff]

Ling:  Step back guys, give 'em some air.

Shang [catching his breath]:  Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust.
[Mulan smiles big]

Ling:  Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all.

Yao [lifting his arm high]:  You're king of the mountain!

Chien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes!

Mulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side]

Shang:  Ping, what's wrong?  [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly] 
He's wounded, get help!  [Ping starts to pass out.  The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] 
Ping, hold on.  Hold on.

[Cut to outside of the medic tent.  Mulan and Medic are inside.  Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite
concerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and
goes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to
fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is
noticeable]

Mulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh,  I can explain.

Chi Fu [stepping into the tent]:  Huh?  So it's true.

Mulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]:  Shang!

[Cut to outside the tent.  Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm.  Mulan uses her other hand to hold the blanket]

Chi Fu:  I knew there was something wrong with you.  [Chi Fu takes off Mulan's hair tie and throws her to the ground]  A woman.

[Ling, Yao and Chien-Po are shocked]

Chi Fu [to the troops]:  Trecherous snake.

Mulan [on the ground kneeling and hunched over, speaking to Shang]:  My name is Mulan.  I did it to save my father.

Chi Fu [to the troops]:  High treason!

Mulan:  I didn't mean for it to go this far.

Chi Fu [getting in Mulan's face and speaking to her while she whinces]:  Ultimate dishonor.

Mulan:  It was the only way.  Please believe me.

Chi Fu [to Shang]:  Hmph, Captain?

[Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard attached to Khan.  Khan rears back]

Chi Fu [to the soldier by Khan]:  Restrain him.

[Shang walks toward Mulan with sword in hand]

Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]:  Noooooo!

Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]:  You know the law.

[Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws
it down in front of Mulan]

Shang:  A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out!

Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]:  But you can't just...

Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]:  I said, "Move out!"

[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes
his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he
moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]

Mushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks
up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi.

Mulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home.

Mushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all
your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry].

Mulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror
[picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the
helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]

Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping
the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by
his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean,
you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles].

Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl.

Mushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep?

Mulan [sadly]:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home.

Mushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll
finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise.

[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site.  Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.  He gets up and glances around]

Shan-Yu [screaming]:  Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!

[Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop out of the snow and join
Shan-Yu.  They set off towards the Imperial City]

Mulan [seeing them from behind, gasps]:  Huh.  [Mulan runs, grabs her sword, mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to the
Imperial City]

Mushu:  Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan is heading]

Mulan:  I have to do something.

Mushu:  Did you see those Huns!?  They popped out of the snow, like daisies!

Mulan:  Are we in this together or not?

Cri-Kee [emphatically]:  Chirp, Chirp.

Mushu:  Well, let's go kick some Huny buns!  [Jumps onto Khan and utters fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City]  Wu Hu Ha
Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga

[Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City.  Fireworks go off, kites are flying.  The drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed
by the acrobats.  The Parade Leader follows, then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers]

Parade Leader:  Make way for the heros of China.

[Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces.  Mulan rides up through the crowd and stops.  She looks around
and sees Shang in the parade]

Mulan [calling out]:  Shang! [riding next to him]

Shang [surprised]:  Mulan?

Mulan:  The Huns are alive, they're in the city.

Shang:  You don't belong here Mulan, go home.

Mulan [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]:  Shang, I saw them in the mountains.  You have to believe me.

Shang:  Why should I?

Mulan [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]:  Why else would I come back?  You said you'd trust Ping.  Why is Mulan any different?

[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward]

Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]:  Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya.

[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard]

Mushu:  Now where are you going?

Mulan [calling over her shoulder]:  To find someone who will believe me.  [Mulan runs into the palace yard]  

[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him
Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent]

Emperor:  My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors.

[The crowd cheers]

[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd]

Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]:  Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's
touch and moves away] [agitated]  But the Huns are here!  [Mulan walks up to Man #2]  Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks
away from Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard]  No one will listen!

Mushu:  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?

Mulan [irritatedly]:  Mushu!

Mushu:  Hey, you're a girl again, remember?

[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor]

Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]:  Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu.

Emperor:  I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud.

[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the
sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that
all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's
men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry
the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating
into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts]

Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]:  No.

Yao [beckoning to the other soldiers]:  C'mon.

[Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the Huns inside]

Shan-Yu [laughs evily]:  Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

[Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram.  They are unsuccessful at opening the door.  Mulan sees
what's going on and arrives at the steps]

Mulan [to herself]:  They'll never reach the Emperor in time.  [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers.  She
whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]  Hey guys, I've got an idea.  [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards the columns]

[Song:  I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background during the next action sequence]

(Be a man) 
We must be swift as 
the coursing river
(Be a man)
With all the force 
of a great typhoon
(Be a man)
With all the strength 
of a raging fire
Mysterious as the 
dark side of the moon

[Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling
and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and
prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column
to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together]

[End song]

[Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and a high balcony within the palace.  Shan-Yu drops down from the roof]

Shan-Yu:  Boo.  [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2] Guard the door [they walk off down
the stairs that lead to the balcony].  [pacing around the Emperor]  Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.  Bow to me.

[Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come down the stairs and close the door, joining
Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man.  Mulan and company are around the corner]

Mulan [whispering]:  Okay, any questions?

Yao [whispering]:  Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps him]  Ow.

[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans]

Hun Archer:  Who's there?

Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]:  Concubines.

Hun Bald Man #1:  Ugly concubines.

Ling [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]:  Oh he's so cute.

[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's
dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure]

Shang [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]:  Aww.

[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk.  Mushu from above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing]

Mushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]:  Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned
falcon doesn't do anything]

[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a
woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two
heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing
Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist
at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun
Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach
followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]

Mulan [calling out]:  Shang, GO!

[Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs]

[Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony]

Shan-Yu:  I tire of your arrogance old man.  [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's
throat] Bow to me!

Emperor:  No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.

Shan-Yu:  Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor]

[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with
his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column
and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls
to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over
forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind
as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm
pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the
stairs]

Mulan:  Chien-Po, get the Emperor.

Chien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]:  Sorry, your Majesty.  

[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in
the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu
watches the Emperor leave]

Shan-Yu:  No! 

 [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and
throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the
edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]

Yao [motioning her to follow]:  Come on!

[Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look.  Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope. 
Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabs
Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope.  Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the
sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.  The crowd cheers]

Shan-Yu:  No!  [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the
throng of people]  Yrraaaaahhhh!

[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls
out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he
puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away. 
Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the
shirt collar]

Shan-Yu [in Shang's face]:  You, you took away my victory.

[Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet.  Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan]

Mulan:  No!  I did!  [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]

Shan-Yu [looking at Mulan]:  The soldier from the mountains.

[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and
through the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right
behind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. 
Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse
catches up with Mulan]

Mushu:  So what's the plan?

Mulan:  Ummmm.

Mushu:  You don't have a plan?!

Mulan:  Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go. 
Mushu--

Mushu:  I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use
the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]

[Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword
wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. 
Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column
causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes
to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to
her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower]

[Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework
lighters) on the edge of the tower] 

Mushu:  Citizens, I need firepower.

Barry Cook:  Who are you?

Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]:  You're
worst nightmare.

[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground]

[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest]

Man in Crowd #1:  On the roof.

Man in Crowd #2:  Look!

[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks
through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her
person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]

Shan-Yu:  It looks like you're out of ideas.

[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through
the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that
Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping
off the fan with her sword movement]

Mulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu?

Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a
stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights
the fuse]

[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in
the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and
stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan
lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to
run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly
propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the
rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the
roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]

Mulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.

[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to
fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs
onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and
releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the
ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]

Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah
ha ha ha ha.  [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to
Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna]

Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate
attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push
Mulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting.

Shang [in Chi Fu's face]:  She's a hero.

Chi Fu:  'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.

Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous--

Emperor [walking down the steps]:  That is enough!

Shang:  Your Majesty, I can explain.

[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear
path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look
waits to write down the words of the Emperor]

Emperor:  I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away
from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  [the Emperor bows to Mulan]

[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. 
Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing
what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the
ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]

Mushu:  My little baby's all grown up and savin' China.  [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?

Emperor:  Chi Fu,

Chi Fu:  Your Excellency?

Emperor:  See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.

Chi Fu [muttering to himself]:  A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]
what? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.

Emperor [to Mulan]:  Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu].

Chi Fu [wobbling to and fro]:  What?...My...[faints]

Mulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]:  With all due respect, your Excellency.  I
have been away from home long enough.

Emperor [taking off his pendant]:  Then take this, so your family will know what you have done
for me.  And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu]  so the world will know what you have done
for China.

[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]

Yao:  Is she allowed to do that?  [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]

[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts
all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground
again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan
starts to smile anticipating something good]

Shang:  Um...[Mulan grins]  You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.

Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan]

Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm.

[Mulan mounts Khan]

Mulan:  Khan, let's go home.

[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground
level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]

Emperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.

Shang [dumbfounded]:  Sir?

Emperor:  You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks
back up the steps to his palace]

[Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands
on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her
approaching and starts to stand]

Fa Zhou:  Mulan.  

[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down]

Mulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of
the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa
Family.

[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. 
He bends down and holds her arms outstretched]

Fa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's
tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so.

Mulan:  I've missed you too Baba.

[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]

Fa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh

Grandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a
ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]

Shang [just arriving]:  Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?

[Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position.  Shang walks
toward Mulan and Fa Zhou]

Grandma Fa:  Woo, sign me up for the next war.

[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]

Shang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]:  Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. 
Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet.  Ah but well, actually
it's your helmet, isn't it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...

[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over.  Mulan holds the helmet Shang offers]

Mulan:  Would you like to stay for dinner?

Grandma Fa [speaking from stage right]:  Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head with a
smile at Grandma Fa's statement]

Shang [reassuredly to Mulan]:  Dinner would be great.

[Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window.  He watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa
Zhou.  Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor's his head]

Mushu [tugging on First Ancestor's ear]:  C'mon, who did a good job?  C'mon, tell me who did a
good job.

First Ancestor [hesitantly]:  Oh, all right.  You can be a guardian again.

Mushu: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh.  [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the
ancestors]

Mushu:  Take it Cri-Kee.

[Song:  True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song]

[Ancestor 1 does a dance from Pulp Fiction while Ancestor 3 does the Hand Jive]

Ancestor 3 [spoken to Ancestor 1]:  She get's it from my side of the family.

Mushu [spoken while swinging on a chain]:  Call out for egg rolls!

First Ancestor [disgusted]:  Guardians.

[Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple.  Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on the
steps]

Mulan:  Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead].

Little Brother:  Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark  

[Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him.  The
chickens follow him in]

First Ancestor [annoyed]:  Mushu!

"THE MUMMY"

                                     Stephen Sommers

                

               The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on 
               the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT 
               rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, 
               it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
               DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not 
               ancient.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

                                    THEBES - 2,134 B.C

               Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

                                     NARRATOR
                         Thebes. City of the Living. Crown 
                         jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

               The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
               CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; 
               an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

               INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

               Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, 
               muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Home of Imhotep, High Priest of 
                         Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

               A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
               takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's 
               wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked 
               body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a 
               stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's 
                         Mistress. No other man was allowed 
                         to touch her.

               She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA 
               comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then 
               it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking 
               TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand 
               nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their 
               eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

               Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, 
               feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, 
               smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

                                     NARRATOR
                         But for our love, we were willing to 
                         risk life itself.

               And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself 
               on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush 
               over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors 
               suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at 
               the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- 
               SUBTITLED.

                                     PHARAOH
                         What are you doing here?

               The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
               was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws 
               them back.

               Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh 
               sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

                                     PHARAOH
                         WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

               From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. 
               Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

                                     PHARAOH
                         Imhotep?... My priest.

               Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back.

               Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous 
               bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the 
               curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep 
               stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from 
               the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and 
               look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
               share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and 
               grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

                                     PRIESTS
                         Pharaoh's bodyguards!

               Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         You must go. Save yourself. Only you 
                         can resurrect me.

               Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

               MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over 
               their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the 
               MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

               Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
                         My body is no longer his temple!

               She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, 
               Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

                                     NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
                         For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's 
                         body was to be cursed. And it was I, 
                         the High Priest, whose duty it was 
                         to curse it.

               EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

               Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
               su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her 
               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Her body was mummified, her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars.

               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of 
               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The Book of The Living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld.

               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves 
               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled 
               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, 
               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the 
               ground.

               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. 
               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears 
               at the Nubians. Killing them.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         The slaves were killed...

               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed 
               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ...and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain, so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site.

               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the 
               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
               way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF 
               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But there was another book, The Book 
                         Of The Dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

                                     IMHOTEP
                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of 
                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace Egypt.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT 
               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and 
               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I 
                         was willing to defy the gods.

               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The 
               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were 
                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made.

               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several 
               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back 
               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them 
               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the 
               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING 
               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are 
               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back 
                         from the dead! Now all that was 
                         needed, was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body.

               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's 
               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and 
               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and 
               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES 
               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks 
               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the 
               swirling hole.

               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         My Priests were condemned to be 
                         mummified alive.

               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT

               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic 
               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and 
               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING 
               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His 
               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose.

               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, 
               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         As for me, I was condemned to endure 
                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient 
                         curses. One so horrible, it had never 
                         before been bestowed.

               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's 
               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue 
               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the 
               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting 
               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And 
                         by eating me, they were cursed just 
                         the same.

               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia 
               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         I was to remain sealed inside my 
                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of 
                         eternity.

               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle 
               BOX.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         They would never allow me to be 
                         released. For I would arise a walking 
                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an 
                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength 
                         of ages, power over the sands, and 
                         the glory of invincibility.

               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The 
               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
                         su-namun from her place in hell, 
                         together, we would be an unstoppable 
                         infection upon this world. The 
                         Apocalypse. The End.

               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming 
               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt 
               onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

                                        THE MUMMY

               The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

               Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, 
               the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins 
               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only 
               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-
               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

               EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

               Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG 
               HORSEMAN.

               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior 
               brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN 
               are the WORDS:

                                    THE SAHARA - 1925

               A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
               LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the 
               onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a 
               jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

               He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at 
               him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I knew this was gonna be a lousy 
                         day.

               A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
               the top of the wall. This is BENI.

                                     BENI
                         Personally, I would like to surrender. 
                         Why can we not just surrender?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

               Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's run away. Right now. While 
                         we can still make it.

               O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now gimme your revolver, you'll never 
                         use it anyway.

               Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody 
                         ever does that anymore.

               O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Now go find me a big stick.

                                     BENI
                         In the desert? What for?

               O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So I can tie it to your back, you 
                         appear to be without a spine.

               The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
               Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How'd a guy like you end up in the 
                         Legion anyways?

                                     BENI
                         I got caught robbing a synagogue. 
                         Lots of good stuff in them holy 
                         places; churches, temples, mosques, 
                         and who's guarding them?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Altar boys?

                                     BENI
                         Exactly! I speak seven languages, 
                         including Hebrew, so my specialty 
                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill 
                         somebody?

               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No, but I'm considering it.

               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                                     BENI
                         What then? Robbery? Extortion? 
                         Kidnapping!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None of the above, thank you.

                                     BENI
                         Then what the hell are you doing 
                         here!?

               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the 
               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was just looking for a good time.

               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly 
               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh shit. Steady!

               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I sayin'?

               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog 
               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         STEADY!!
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell am I doin'?

               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels 
               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with 
               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the 
               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FIRE!

               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING 
               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, 
               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him. He crawls through the front gate.

               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He 
               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts.

               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Son-of-a-bitch.

               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!

               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!

               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU 
                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!

               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm gonna get you for this!

               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his 
               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer 
               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The 
               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them 
               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The 
               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like 
               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts.

               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the 
               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit 
               statue of Anubis stares back at him.

               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The 
               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the 
               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

               EXT. RIDGE - DAY

               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have 
               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark 
               eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...

               EXT. CAIRO - DAY

               Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their 
               positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with 
               every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.

               WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:

                                          CAIRO

               INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the 
               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, 
               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- 
               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with 
               her.

               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows 
               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up 
                         here?

               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles 
               begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long 
               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too 
               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, 
               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her 
               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle.

                                     EVELYN
                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!

               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling 
               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
               into the next bookshelf.

               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after 
               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last 
               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She 
               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oops.

               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

                                     CURATOR
                         Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! 
                         Give me frogs, flies, locusts, 
                         anything but this! Compared to you, 
                         the other plagues were a joy!

               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm sorry, it was an accident.

                                     CURATOR
                         When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it 
                         was an accident. You are a 
                         catastrophe! Why do I put up with 
                         you?

               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                                     EVELYN
                         You put up with me, because I can 
                         read and write ancient Egyptian, 
                         decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, 
                         and I'm the only person within a 
                         thousand miles who knows how to 
                         properly code and catalogue this 
                         library.

                                     CURATOR
                         Who needs smart women? I put up with 
                         you because your mother and father 
                         were our finest patrons, Allah rest 
                         their souls. Now straighten up this 
                         mess!

               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

                                     EVELYN
                         Hello?

               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

                                     EVELYN
                         Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

               INT. THE RAMESSEUM

               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. 
               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from 
               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they 
               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She 
               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases 
               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this 
               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch, and peers inside.

               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out 
               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, 
               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half 
               drunk.

                                     EVELYN
                         You...! YOU...!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please 
                         call me something original.

               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                                     EVELYN
                         Have you no respect for the dead?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right now, I only wish to join them.

               He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather 
                         than later, before you ruin my career 
                         the way you've ruined yours.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll 
                         have you know, that at this moment 
                         my career is on a high note.

               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

                                     EVELYN
                         High note? Ha! For five years you've 
                         been scrounging around Egypt, and 
                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.

               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes I do! I have something right 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh no, not another worthless trinket, 
                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the Curator to try and 
                         sell for you.

               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY 
               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly 
               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where did you get this?

               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

                                     JONATHAN
                         On a dig, down in Thebes.

               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

                                     JONATHAN
                         My whole life I've never found 
                         anything, Evy. Tell me I've found 
                         something.

               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle 
               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, 
               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box 
               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

                                     EVELYN
                         Jonathan?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes?

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you found something.

               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         See the cartouche there, it's the 
                         official royal seal of Seti the First, 
                         I'm sure of it.

                                     CURATOR
                         Perhaps.

               Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Two questions. Who the hell is Seti 
                         the First? And was he rich?

                                     EVELYN
                         He was the last Pharaoh of the Old 
                         Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest 
                         Pharaoh of them all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Alright, good, that's good. I like 
                         this fellow, like him very much.

               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I've already dated it, this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old. And 
                         the hieratics over here...
                              (Inhales deeply)
                         It's Hamunaptra.

               The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

                                     CURATOR
                         My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, 
                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. 
                         Hamunaptra is a myth.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the 
                         early Pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of Egypt.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Right, right, in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber. Everybody knows 
                         the story. The entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. On 
                         Pharaoh's command, a flick of the 
                         switch! And the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes.

                                     EVELYN
                         All we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 
                         B.C.

               The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.

                                     CURATOR
                         As the Americans would say: it's all 
                         fairy tales and hokum.

               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws 
               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now 
               missing.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You burned it! You burned off the 
                         part with the lost city!

                                     CURATOR
                         It's for the best, I'm sure. Many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no 
                         one has ever found it, most have 
                         never returned.

                                     JONATHAN
                              (devastated)
                         You killed my map.

                                     CURATOR
                         I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm 
                         surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to 
                         be so fooled.

               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

               EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every 
               low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a 
               first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across 
               the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.

                                     EVELYN
                         You told me you found it on a dig 
                         down in Thebes!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I was mistaken.

                                     EVELYN
                         You lied to me!

                                     JONATHAN
                         I lie to everybody, what makes you 
                         so special?

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That just makes you more gullible.

                                     EVELYN
                         You stole it from a drunk at the 
                         local Casbah?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Picked his pocket, actually.

               EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY

               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what is he in prison for?

                                     WARDEN
                         I did not know, so when I heard you 
                         were coming, I asked him that myself.

                                     EVELYN
                         And what did he say?

                                     WARDEN
                         He said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, 
               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                                     EVELYN
                         But he's just a filthy criminal?

                                     JONATHAN
                              (cringing)
                         Way to go, Evy.

               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So who's the broad?

                                     EVELYN
                         Broad?!

                                     JONATHAN
                         She's my sister, actually.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a 
                         total loss.

               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

                                     WARDEN
                         I'll be back in a moment.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         I tremble with anticipation.

               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         We uh,... found... your puzzle box, 
                         and we've come to ask you about it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No.

                                     EVELYN
                         No?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No... You came to ask me about 
                         Hamunaptra.

               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

                                     EVELYN
                         How do you know the box pertains to 
                         Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's where I found it. I 
                         was there.

               Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

                                     JONATHAN
                         How do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey,... don't I know you?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Um, well, you see...

               O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
               square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A 
               Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

               He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

               Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         You were actually at Hamunaptra?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just decked your brother

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, well...
                              (shrugs)
                         I know my brother.

               O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I was there.

                                     EVELYN
                         You swear?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Every damn day.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, I mean --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         -- I know what you mean. I was there, 
                         alright. Seti's place. The City Of 
                         The Dead.

                                     EVELYN
                         What did you find? What did you see?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I found sand. I saw death.

               The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Could you tell me how to get there? 
                         The exact location?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Want to know?

               Evelyn leans in even closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Really want to know?

               She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes.

               O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then get me the hell outta here.

               Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, 
               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where are they taking him?

                                     WARDEN
                         To be hanged.

               Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

                                     WARDEN
                         Apparently, he had a very good time.

               EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

               Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

                                     WARDEN
                         No women allowed.

                                     EVELYN
                         I am an English woman.

               This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

                                     EVELYN
                         I will give you one hundred pounds 
                         to spare his life.

                                     WARDEN
                         I would pay one hundred pounds just 
                         to see him hang.

                                     EVELYN
                         Two hundred pounds.

                                     WARDEN
                         Proceed!

                                     EVELYN
                         Three hundred pounds!

               O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than 
               Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

                                     HANGMAN
                         Any last requests, pig?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

               The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                                     EVELYN
                         FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

               The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

                                     WARDEN
                         And what else?

               Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!

               O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then 
               JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

               But he's still alive, because --

                                     WARDEN
                         His neck did not break! Good! Now we 
                         watch him strangle to death.

               The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

               The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                                     EVELYN
                         He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

               The warden spins around and faces her.

                                     WARDEN
                         You lie.

                                     EVELYN
                         I would never!

               At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

                                     WARDEN
                         Are you saying this filthy godless 
                         son of a pig knows where to find The 
                         City Of The Dead? Truly?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes and if you cut him down, we will 
                         give you ten percent.

                                     WARDEN
                         Fifty percent.

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty.

                                     WARDEN
                         Forty.

               Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--
                         !

                                     EVELYN
                         Twenty-five percent, and not one 
                         single farthing more.

               The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. 
               A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES 
               to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

               All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up 
               at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

               CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

                                     CURATOR
                         She must die.

               Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA: 
               blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One 
               of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

                                     HOOK
                         She is like all the others. She will 
                         die in the desert.

                                     CURATOR
                         No! She has seen too much. She knows 
                         too much.

               The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                                     CURATOR
                         Not only does she have a map, but 
                         she has the key.

               Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

                                     HOOK
                         The key!? She has the lost key!?

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes. No one has ever had so much, 
                         been so close. We must stop her, or 
                         it will be the end of us all.

                                     HOOK
                         Then we will kill her, we will kill 
                         her and all those with her.

                                     CURATOR
                         And burn the map and retrieve the 
                         key.

                                     HOOK
                         It will be done. But what of the 
                         American expedition? They leave 
                         tomorrow as well.

                                     CURATOR
                         Forget the bumbling Americans, they 
                         will be like all the others. Without 
                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find Hamunaptra?

               EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

               SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.

                                     BENI
                         It is three days down the Nile, then 
                         two days by camel, sahibs.

               WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a 
               PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

                                     DANIELS
                         For all the money we're paying you, 
                         something better god-damned well be 
                         under that sand.

               WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

                                     HENDERSON
                         "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya 
                         gotta keep sayin, to yourself, 
                         "Hamunaptra."

               Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn 
               and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS 
               selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you really think he'll show up?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he 
                         may be a cowboy, but his word is his 
                         word.

                                     EVELYN
                         Personally, I think he's filthy, 
                         rude and a complete scoundrel. I 
                         don't like him one bit.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Anyone I know?

               They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh... um,... hello.

               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Smashing day for the start of an 
                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?

               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, sure, smashing.

               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the 
               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

                                     BURNS
                         You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

                                     BENI
                         Along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison, sahib.

               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

                                     BENI
                         A thousand pardons, my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done.

               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                                     EVELYN
                         Mister O'Connell, can you look me in 
                         the eye, and guarantee me this is 
                         not some sort of flimflam? Because 
                         if it is, I'm warning you --

               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         Colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         Libya and into Egypt to find that 
                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was 
                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out 
                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your 
                         bags.

               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, 
                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

                                     WARDEN
                         A bright good morning to all.

                                     EVELYN
                         What are you doing here?

                                     WARDEN
                         I have come to protect my investment, 
                         thank you very much.

               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA 
               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one 
               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two 
               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell 
               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we 
                         could use another good player.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I only gamble with my life, never my 
                         money.

                                     DANIELS
                         Never? What if I were to wager five 
                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         Hamunaptra before you?

               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yer on.

               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                                     BURNS
                         What makes you so confident, sir?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What makes you?

               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We got us a man who's actually been 
                         there.

               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what a coincidence, why --

               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

                                     JONATHAN
                         -- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? 
                         I thought I just dealt?

               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

                                     EVELYN
                         The only thing that scares me, Mister 
                         O'Connell, are your manners.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         If you call that a kiss.

               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     EVELYN
                         Did I miss something? Are we going 
                         into battle?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The last time I was at that place 
                         everybody I was with died.

               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's something out there, you 
                         know, something under that sand.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain 
                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother 
                         thinks there's treasure. What do you 
                         think is out there?

               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin 
                         believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, 
                         they call it, "the doorway to hell."

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to 
                         the underworld", actually.

               She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                                     EVELYN
                         I don't believe in fairy tales and 
                         hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do 
                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         The Book Of The Living. It's what 
                         first interested me in Egypt as a 
                         child. It's why I came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know your history.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know my treasure.

               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                                     EVELYN
                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?

               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I was about to be hanged, seemed 
                         like a good idea at the time.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Wha'd I say?

               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

                                     BENI
                         My very good friend! What a surprise.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         Beni. I oughta kill you.

               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                                     BENI
                         You never were any good with the 
                         ladies, O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So you're the one leading the 
                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So 
                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

                                     BENI
                         Unfortunately no, these Americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when I get them back to 
                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.

               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                                     BENI
                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, 
                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? 
                         The devil himself lives out there.

               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the 
               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and 
               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least I could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

                                     BENI
                         You always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Let's make us even, shall we?

                                     BENI
                         Even?

               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

                                     BENI (O.S.)
                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you 
                         for this!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sounds familiar.

               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE 
               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                                     HOOK
                         Where is the map?

               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

                                     HOOK
                         And the key? Where is the key?

               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

                                     HOOK
                         Then I'll find it myself.

               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               O'Connell looks at her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Friend of yours?

               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table 
               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell 
               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's 
               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene 
               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, 
               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

               HALLWAY - NIGHT

               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                                     EVELYN
                         The map! We need the map!

               He shoves her up against a wall.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax! I'm the map!
                              (taps his forehead)
                         It's all up here.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh that's comforting.

               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, there's still one more of 
                         those guys around here somewhere.

               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!!

               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A 
               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine --

               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the 
               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their 
               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The 
               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now 
               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Can you swim?

                                     EVELYN
                         Well of course I can swim, if the 
                         occasion calls for it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Trust me.

               He picks her up and throws her over the side.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The occasion calls for it.

               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after 
               her.

               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, 
               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything 
               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Americans.

               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his 
               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes 
               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to 
               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook 
               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say! Good show!

               Then he points his thumb at himself

                                     JONATHAN
                         And did I panic?

               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I think not.

               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan 
               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the 
               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the 
               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

                                     BENI
                         Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I 
                         got all the horses!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on 
                         the wrong side of the river!

               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand 
               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

               BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading 
               post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them 
               the reins of four ugly old camels.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't believe the price of these 
                         fleabags.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We coulda had 'em for free, all we 
                         had to do was give 'em your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Awfully.

               And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's 
               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then again...

               SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in 
               the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. 
                         They smell, they bite, they spit. 
                         Disgusting.

               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his 
               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, disgusting.

               Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well I think they're cute.

               WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the 
               desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

               FRYING PAN - NIGHT

               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking 
               across the vast wasteland.

               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the 
               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden 
               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to 
               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, 
               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking 
               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he 
               looks up at a distant ridge --

               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing 
               them.

               EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

               The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as 
               Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And you snore!

                                     WARDEN
                         I do not snore!

                                     JONATHAN
                         All night you snored!

                                     WARDEN
                         I have never snored!

               Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're almost there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Are you sure?

               O'Connell looks down at the ground.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure.

               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking 
               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the 
               skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the 
               desert floor.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What in bloody hell is this?

               The Warden shivers in fear.

                                     WARDEN
                         Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE 
               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, 
               the rest ride horses.

                                     BENI
                         Good morning, my friend!

               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred 
               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless 
               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

                                     DANIELS
                         Well, what the hell we doin'?

                                     BENI
                         Patience, my good sahib, patience.

               Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

                                     HENDERSON
                         First one to the city, O'Connell! 
                         Five hundred! Cash bucks!

               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts 
               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get ready.

               Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

                                     EVELYN
                         For what?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We're about to be shown the way.

               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the 
               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

                                     DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
                         HEYA!

               The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

                                     DANIELS
                         SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

               Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't 
                         we be going?

                                     EVELYN
                         After all, you rode us night and day 
                         to win that bet.

               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the 
               Americans and spits into the sand.

                                     BENI
                         Fools.

               And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

               Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

               The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
               way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

               The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

               The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
               volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell 
               and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And 
               the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from 
               his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it 
               to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

               The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

               The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

               And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

               And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else 
               hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

               And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

               Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. 
               Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

               But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni 
               off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

               Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never 
               felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this 
               girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of 
               the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
               him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn! Slow down!

               Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S 
                         A REALLY BIG --

               INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Never mind.

               The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
               the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy 
               hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three 
               Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats 
               flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty 
               backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

                                     DANIELS
                         Where'd all these camels come from?

                                     BENI
                         They belong to the dead. They will 
                         wait years for their masters to return 
                         before leaving.

               EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next 
               to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS 
               and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That thing gives me the creeps.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Be nice. That thing saved my life.

               Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

                                     EVELYN
                         That "thing" gets me excited.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (sarcastic)
                         The things that get you excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to Bembridge Scholars, 
                         inside the statue of Anubis was a 
                         secret compartment, perhaps containing 
                         The Book Of The Living.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are those mirrors for?

                                     EVELYN
                         Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

               O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.

               INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                                     EVELYN
                         Do you realize, we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years.

                                     WARDEN
                         Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And it stinks to high heaven in here.

               Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Cretins.

               Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops 
               sniffing.

               Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF 
               LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT 
               HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE 
               DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT 
               RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's 
               chamber.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That is a neat trick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Preparation for what?

                                     EVELYN
                         For entering the afterlife.

               O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Mummies, my good son, this is where 
                         they made the mummies.

               Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat 
               warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and 
               freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

               They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker 
               and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and 
               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan 
               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

               ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

               Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the 
               other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn 
               behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

               O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT 
               HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because 
               it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Likewise.

               But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

                                     DANIELS
                         This here is our statue,... friend.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't see your name on it,... pal.

               And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

                                     BENI
                         Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are 
                         no-so-good.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've had worse.

               Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, me too.

               O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, 
               grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then 
               Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

                                     EVELYN
                         Let's be nice, children, if we're 
                         going to play together, we must learn 
                         to share.

               Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.

               Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing.

               The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the 
               ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my calculations, we 
                         should be right under the statue. 
                         We'll come up right between his legs.
                              (she blushes and laughs)
                         Oh my.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And when those dirty Yanks go to 
                         sleep --
                              (looks at O'Connell)
                         No offense.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         None taken.

                                     JONATHAN
                         We'll sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And you're sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't 
                         already found it.

               Jonathan looks around.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, what's our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to?

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

               A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's 
               found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         Seti was no fool.

               Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, sure...

               He looks back at the native Diggers.

                                     HENDERSON
                         We'll let him open it.

               The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

               The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

               Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme get this straight, they stuck 
                         a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, 
                         cut your brain into small pieces, 
                         then ripped it all out through your 
                         nostrils?

                                     JONATHAN
                         OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

                                     EVELYN
                         It's called mummification. You're 
                         dead when they do this

                                     JONATHAN
                         Still...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two are worse than a couple of 
                         schoolboys.

               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES 
               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE 
               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER

               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, 
               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         FENI!

               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, 
               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The 
               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers 
               give one final pull and --

               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS 
               THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

               Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the 
               ground...

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling?

                                     EVELYN
                         They didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone 
                         of great importance. Or he did 
                         something very naughty.

               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to 
               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE 
               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS 
               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The 
               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The 
               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and 
               COUGHING.

               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it 
               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well?... Who is it?

               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                                     EVELYN
                         'He that shall not be named.'

               O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There's some sort of lock here. You 
                         say these thing's are made of granite 
                         with a steel interior?

                                     EVELYN
                         Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting 
                         out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No kiddin', without a key, it'll 
                         take us a month to crack this thing,

                                     EVELYN
                         A key! That's it! That's what he was 
                         talking about.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who was talking about what?

               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                                     EVELYN
                         The man on the barge. The one with 
                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine!

               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through 
               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden 
               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The 
               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                                     EVELYN
                         What do you suppose killed him?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you ever see him eat?

               O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Seems the Americans had a little 
                         misadventure of their own today, 
                         three of their diggers were killed.

                                     EVELYN
                         How?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. 
                         Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Maybe this place really is cursed.

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.

               The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous 
               look. Evelyn laughs.

                                     EVELYN
                         You two!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't believe in curses, huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I believe if I can see it and I 
                         can touch it, then it's real. That's 
                         what I believe.

               O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I believe in being prepared.

               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the 
               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY 
               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the 
               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN
                         WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

               Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch 
               and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Seagrams!

               Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside 
               out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, he may have been a stinky 
                         fellow,... but he had good taste.

               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then 
               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

               O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Stay here!

               He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately 
               gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the 
               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man 
                         just say -- !

               EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS 
               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as 
               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill 
               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps 
               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, 
               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Goin' somewhere?

                                     BENI
                         Just looking for you, O'Connell! I 
                         wanted to be with my friend!

               O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon, friend.

                                     BENI
                              (struggling)
                         Why do you like to fight so much?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         'Cause I look good doin, it.

               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down 
               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, 
               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to 
               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point 
               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, 
               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider 
               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises 
               his scimitar, about to strike.

               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant 
               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins.

               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune.

               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let 'em have it, boys!

               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, 
               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, bloody good show.

               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something 
               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, 
               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It 
               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two 
               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray 
               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE 
                         OR DIE!

               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after 
               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, 
               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn 
               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her 
               and holds her close.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You alright?

               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time 
               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's 
               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes,... fine,... thank you.

               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and 
               Burns help Daniels to his feet.

                                     DANIELS
                         See! That proves it! Old Seti's 
                         fortune's gotta be under this sand!

                                     HENDERSON
                         For them to protect it like this, 
                         you just know there's got to be 
                         treasure down there.

               O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These men are a desert people. They 
                         value water, not gold.

               Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

                                     EVELYN
                         Where's Jonathan?

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

               Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the 
               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

                                     EVELYN
                         Unlike my brother, sir, I know when 
                         to say no.

               O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Unlike your brother, Miss, you I 
                         don't get. You're a whole new brew.

                                     EVELYN
                         I know, you're wondering, what's a 
                         place like me doing in a girl like 
                         this?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Something like that.

                                     EVELYN
                         Egypt is in my blood. My father was 
                         a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so 
                         much that he married an Egyptian. My 
                         mother! Who was quite an adventurer 
                         herself

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, I get your father, I get your 
                         mother and I get your brother, but 
                         what are you doing here?

               Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                                     EVELYN
                         I may not be an explorer, or an 
                         adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or 
                         a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But 
                         I'm proud of what I am.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And what is that?

               Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins 
               and proudly lifts her head high.

                                     EVELYN
                         ...I am a librarian!

               She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm going to kiss you, Mister 
                         O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         No you're not.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm not?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not unless you call me Rick.

                                     EVELYN
                         Why would I do that?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Because that's my name.

               She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES 
               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                                     EVELYN
                         I can't believe I allowed the two of 
                         you to get me drunk.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Don't blame me, I don't even remember 
                         being there.

                                     EVELYN
                         Well neither do I, thank you.

               O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You don't?

               Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

                                     EVELYN
                         No... Why?... Should I?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Gee, yeah, you told me it was the 
                         best time you ever had.

               O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF 
               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and MOAN.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.

               Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out 
               the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.

               Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         There is a curse upon this chest.

                                     DANIELS
                         Curse my ass.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, who cares.

               The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         In these hallowed grounds, that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times, is 
                         as strong today, as it was then.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

               The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         "Death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest".

               A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER 
               All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.

               The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         It says, there is one, the undead, 
                         who if brought back to life, is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, well, let's just make sure we 
                         don't bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then, huh?

               The three Americans laugh.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         He will kill all who open this 
                         chest,... and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids.

                                     DANIELS
                         Assimilate their organs and fluids? 
                         Ya mean eat 'em?

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         And in so doing he will regenerate. 
                         And no longer be the undead, but a 
                         plague upon this earth.

               The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and 
               the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just 
               shrugs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next 
               to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, I've dreamed about this 
                         ever since I was a little girl.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You dream about dead guys?

               Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and 
               cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

                                     EVELYN
                         Look, all the sacred spells have 
                         been chiseled off. The hieratics and 
                         hieroglyphs that protect the deceased 
                         on his journey into the afterlife, 
                         they've been removed. This man was 
                         cursed,... doomed.

               O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Tough break.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see 
                         who's inside, shall we?

               Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box 
               into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a 
               HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs

               the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan 
               helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.

               And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT 
               INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN
                         AHHHHH!!!

               They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 
               'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years 
               have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
               chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background, 
               Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                                     BENI
                         The curse,... beware the curse!

               Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

                                     DANIELS
                         Stupid superstitious bastard.

               And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT 
               OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and 
               carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Is he supposed to look like that?

                                     EVELYN
                         No. I've never seen a mummy look 
                         like this. He's, he's still...

                                     JONATHAN
                         Juicy?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. He's more than four thousand 
                         years old and still decomposing.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         And look at this.

               O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there 
               are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh my god, he was buried alive.

               This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

                                     EVELYN
                         And he left a message.

               WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

                                     EVELYN
                         It says: 'Death is only the 
                         beginning.'

               Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's my gun?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What are you going to do? Shoot him?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book 
               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         I have heard told of this book, but 
                         I never truly believed it existed. 
                         This, good gentlemen, is a most 
                         priceless treasure.

               Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

                                     HENDERSON
                         I wouldn't trade ya for a brass 
                         spittoon!

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta 
                         pure gold!

               Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL 
               ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What is this stuff? It smells like 
                         our late friend, the Warden.

               O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You did not!?... We're not!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Rat gizzards. They smell bad and 
                         taste worse, but that's the best the 
                         desert has to offer.

               The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Say O'Connell, whadaya think these 
                         honey's'll fetch back home?

                                     BURNS
                         We hear you gentlemen found yerselves 
                         a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

                                     DANIELS
                         Ya know if ya dry him out, you can 
                         sell him for firewood.

               The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a 
               pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

                                     EVELYN
                         Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them 
                         inside our friend's coffin. They can 
                         stay alive for years living off the 
                         flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

               She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                                     EVELYN
                         Famished.

               O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are you saying somebody threw these 
                         things in with our guy, and they 
                         slowly ate him alive?

                                     EVELYN
                         Very slowly.

                                     JONATHAN
                         He certainly was not a popular fellow 
                         when they planted him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Must of got a little too frisky with 
                         the Pharaoh's daughter.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to my readings, our friend 
                         suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of 
                         all ancient Egyptian curses, one 
                         reserved for only the most evil 
                         blasphemers. In all of my research, 
                         I've never read of this curse actually 
                         having been performed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That bad huh?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, they never used it because they 
                         feared it so. It's written, that if 
                         a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever 
                         arise, he would bring with him the 
                         ten plagues of Egypt.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The ten plagues?... You mean all ten 
                         plagues.

                                     BENI
                         Like what that Moses guy did to that 
                         Pharaoh guy?

                                     EVELYN
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Let's see, there was frogs, flies, 
                         locusts...

                                     BURNS
                         Hail and fire.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The sun turning black.

                                     DANIELS
                         Water turning to blood.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And my personal favorite: people 
                         covered in boils and sores.

               All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just 
               laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                                     EVELYN
                         Fried gizzard anyone?

               EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the 
               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn 
               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over 
               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You sure you outta be playin, around 
                         with that?

                                     EVELYN
                         It's just a book, no harm ever came 
                         from a book.

               Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell 
               share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

               Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's 
               chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN 
               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards 
               Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills 
               FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!

               Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

               The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, 
               sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

               He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard, 
               coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all 
               leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

               The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the 
               darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops 
               everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their 
               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid 
               vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

               The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The 
               Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.

                                     EGYPTOLOGIST
                         What have we done?

               The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth, 
               slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! 
                         Billions of grasshoppers!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's one of the plagues, right? 
                         The grasshopper plague!

                                     EVELYN
                         This is not a plague. It's 
                         generational. Every so many years 
                         the locusts of Egypt have a population 
                         explosion and they all take flight.

               Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers 
               his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... and what about frogs?

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.

               Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, 
               they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet, 
               squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels! Henderson!

               INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to 
               SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF 
               CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start 
               scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.

               Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul 
               ass.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out 
               in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything.

               Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps 
               out.

                                     BURNS
                         Daniels?... is that you?

               Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

                                     BURNS
                         Henderson?

               Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands 
               reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns 
               jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at 
               them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts 
               to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just 
               ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

               O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next 
               to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of 
               the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send 
               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then 
               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

                                     JONATHAN
                         EVY!?

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully 
               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels 
               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft 
               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A 
               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards 
               him.

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh thank goodness, you're one of the 
                         Americans, aren't you?

               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF 
               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, 
               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around 
               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is 
               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, 
               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Anck-su-namun?

               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! Must be a trap door around 
                         here or somethin'.

               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, 
               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

                                     HENDERSON
                         RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly 
               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and 
               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as 
               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through 
               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels 
               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already 
               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul 
               ass.

               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to 
               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

                                     EVELYN
                         Help me,... please,... help me.

               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because 
               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the 
               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a 
               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his 
               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying 
               around the corner and runs right up to her.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Would you quit playin, around! Let's 
                         get outta here already!

               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at 
               the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         WHOA!

               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering 
               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts 
               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops 
               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial 
               SHRIEK.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his 
               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Ahhhhhhhh!!

               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the 
               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his 
               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN 
               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson, 
               Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, 
               hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I told you to leave or die, you 
                         refused, and now you may have killed 
                         us all. For you have unleashed the 
                         creature that we have feared for 
                         more than four thousand years.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Relax, I got him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         No mortal weapons can kill this 
                         creature. He is not of this world.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Are we talkin, about the same 
                         creature? The walking corpse? Really 
                         big mouth? Really bad breath?

               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He 
               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs 
               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but 
               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his 
               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly 
               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

                                     BENI
                         May the good Lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock. And may Satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever.

               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them 
               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his 
               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a 
               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and 
               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for 
               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses 
               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand 
               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (subtitled)
                         The language of the slaves.

               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (in Hebrew -- subtitled)
                         I may have use for you. And the 
                         rewards will be great.

               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out 
               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, 
               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a 
               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises 
               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Where are the other sacred jars?

               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

               Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant 
               sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

                                     DANIELS
                         You bastards!

                                     HENDERSON
                         What did you do to him!?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We saved him! Saved him before the 
                         creature could finish his work. Now 
                         leave, all of you, quickly, before 
                         he finishes you all.

                                     JONATHAN
                         You're not going to kill us?

               Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         We must now hunt him down, and try 
                         and find a way to kill him, before 
                         he consumes the earth. Allah be with 
                         us.

               Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.

               O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I told ya, I already got him!

               Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Know this, the creature will be coming 
                         for you. He must consummate the curse. 
                         And until he does, he will never 
                         eat, he will never sleep, and he 
                         will never stop.

               Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,

               EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels 
               and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist, 
               still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.

               They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...

               And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY 
               PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC, 
               PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --

                                     IMHOTEP
                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

               A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front 
               gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty 
               camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

               INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

               A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

               O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I thought you didn't believe in this 
                         stuff!?

               O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

                                     EVELYN
                         Having an encounter with a four 
                         thousand year old walking-talking 
                         corpse tends to convert one.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Forget it, we're out the door down 
                         the hall and gone.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, we are not.

               O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yes we are.

               O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues 
               to UNPACK them:

                                     EVELYN
                         No we are not. We woke him up, and 
                         we must try and stop him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We?! What we?! You didn't read that 
                         book. I told you not to play around 
                         with that thing.

                                     EVELYN
                         Alright then, Me, I,... I read the 
                         book, I woke him up and I intend to 
                         stop him.

               O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         How!? You heard the man, no mortal 
                         weapons can kill this guy.

               Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                                     EVELYN
                         Then we'll have to find some immortal 
                         ones.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         There goes that belief again. Not 
                         me, I am outta here!

               O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking 
               his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

                                     EVELYN
                         According to that Book, once this 
                         creature has been reborn, his curse 
                         will spread, and as he grows in 
                         strength, so will his curse grow, 
                         infecting the people until the whole 
                         of the earth is destroyed.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

                                     EVELYN
                              (incredulous)
                         It's everybody's problem!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Look lady, I appreciate you saving 
                         my life and all, but when I signed 
                         on, I agreed to take you out there 
                         and bring you back, and I did, now 
                         were even, end of job, end of story, 
                         contract terminated.

                                     EVELYN
                         That's what I am to you? A contract?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You can either tag along with me, or 
                         you can stay here and play around 
                         with Mister Maggot.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm staying.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         FINE.

               O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the 
               door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a 
               handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni 
               coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his 
               face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Beni ya little stinkweed, where did 
                         you slink off to?

                                     BENI
                         You left me! You left me in the desert 
                         to rot.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
                              (gestures to Imhotep)
                         So who's this guy?

                                     BENI
                         This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest 
                         of Osiris.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

               O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils 
               O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

                                     BENI
                         The Prince does not like to be touched 
                         by other humans. A Silly eastern 
                         superstition, I'm afraid.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Yeah, well, we all got our little 
                         problems today don't we?

                                     BENI
                         He has come to help Mister Burns. 
                         Somehow I feel responsible.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't gimme that, you never had any 
                         scruples.

                                     BENI
                         Do you know where I can steal some?

               O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives 
               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         See ya around, Padre.

               Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and 
               hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a 
               walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

               He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm the last of the Royal Force still 
                         stationed here, you know? All the 
                         other laddies died in the air and 
                         were buried in the sand.

               The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to 
               O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                                     WINSTON
                         Ever since the end of the Great War, 
                         there hasn't been a single challenge 
                         worthy of a man like me.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I've heard it before, Winston.

               O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I just wish I would've chucked it 
                         with the other laddies, gone down in 
                         a flame of glory, instead of sitting 
                         around here, rotting from boredom 
                         and booze!

               Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods 
               Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

               Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

                                     BURNS
                         The drawer there, spectacles.
                              (tries to laugh)
                         As you see, I won't be needing them.

               Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He 
               puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins 
               broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                                     BENI
                         Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks 
                         you for your spectacles, -- and for 
                         your eyes,... and for your tongue.

               The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                                     BENI
                         But I am afraid more is needed, the 
                         Prince says he must finish the job, 
                         consummate the curse which you and 
                         your friends have brought down upon 
                         yourselves.

               A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly 
               backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the 
               sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing 
               his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

               INT. CASBAH - DAY

               Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and 
               Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT 
               OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

                                     HENDERSON
                         Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... 
                         like...

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Blood.

               They all look at each other, even more nervous.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "And the rivers and waters of Egypt 
                         went red and were as blood."

               A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here.

               He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Who's here!?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

               LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound, 
               knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

               EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

               Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops 
               half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We got problems.

               And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the 
               courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain 
               bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and 
               CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         He's here! I saw him! That thing is 
                         here!

                                     EVELYN
                         The creature!? Are you sure!?

               O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the 
               HAIL and FIRE.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Pretty sure!

               The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

               O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

               INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

               O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant 
               who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they 
               spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- 
               HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

               Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are 
               shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his 
               gun.

               Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful 
               new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and 
               REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and 
               CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

               The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We are in serious trouble.

               Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Back off, creep.

               Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep 
               Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

               Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're 
               all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

               O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep 
               in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND 
               GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, 
               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of 
               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist 
               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as 
               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, 
               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that 
               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, 
               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         You saved me from the undead. For 
                         this, I shall make you immortal.

               He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

               And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins 
               into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

               Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

                                     HENDERSON
                         The curse. The curse.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn 
               across the Ramesseum.

                                     EVELYN
                         There's only one person I know who 
                         can possibly give us some answers.

               They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is 
               talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         YOU!

               O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth 
               Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

                                     CURATOR
                         Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

                                     EVELYN
                         What is he doing here?

                                     CURATOR
                         Do you truly wish to know? Or would 
                         you prefer to just shoot us?

               Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I just saw my fist vanish into some 
                         guy's head.

               He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I'm willin, to go on a little faith, 
                         here.

                                     CURATOR
                         You will not believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Try me.

               INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

               Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The 
               First.

               We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits on Seti's 
               throne.

                                     CURATOR
                         We are part of an ancient secret 
                         society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and 
                         we have a sacred mission, passed 
                         down through thirty-nine generations. 
                         For over four thousand years we have 
                         guarded The City Of The Dead. we are 
                         sworn at manhood to do any and all 
                         in our power to stop the High Priest 
                         Imhotep from being reborn into this 
                         world.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And because of you, we have failed.

                                     EVELYN
                              (appalled)
                         And you think this justifies killing 
                         innocent people!?

                                     CURATOR
                         To have stopped this creature? Yes!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's 
                         afraid of cats, what's that about?

                                     CURATOR
                         According to the ancients, cat's are 
                         the guardians at the gates of the 
                         underworld. Imhotep will fear them 
                         until he is fully regenerated, and 
                         then he will fear nothing.

               Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

                                     DANIELS
                         Right! And ya know how he gets fully 
                         regenerated?! By killing everybody 
                         who opened that chest and sucking us 
                         dry! That's how!

                                     CURATOR
                         Yes, the creature must first try and 
                         regenerate, and then he will attempt 
                         to resurrect the one he has loved 
                         for more than four thousand years.

                                     EVELYN
                         Anck-su-namun.

               The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

                                     EVELYN
                         In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
                         alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
                         su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' 
                         quarters he tried to kiss me.

                                     CURATOR
                         It is because it was you who read 
                         from the Book. He has chosen you to 
                         be the human sacrifice needed to 
                         regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

               Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                                     JONATHAN
                         This is not good. Not good at all.

               Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Tonight is the full moon. The moon 
                         of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

               Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we 
               can see the SUN, -- which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         "...and he stretched forth his hands 
                         towards the heavens, and there was 
                         darkness throughout the land of 
                         Egypt."

               EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning 
               the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.

               EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

                                     EVELYN
                         We must stop him from regenerating.

               She turns to Daniels and Henderson.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who opened that chest?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Well, there was me and Daniels here 
                         and then poor Burns of course, oh 
                         yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

               O'Connell turns from the window.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What about my buddy, Beni?

                                     DANIELS
                         Naw, he scrammed outta there,

                                     EVELYN
                         We must find the Egyptologist and 
                         bring him back here to the safety of 
                         the fort, before the creature can 
                         get to him.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you 
                         two come with me.

               All three of them pounce on him at once --

                                     HENDERSON
                         The hell with that! I'm not goin' 
                         nowhere! We're safe here.

                                     DANIELS
                         Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for 
                         nothin'.

                                     EVELYN
                         Who put you in charge? You can't 
                         just leave me behind like some old 
                         suitcase. I'm the one responsible 
                         for this mess and I intend to be the 
                         one to clean it up.

               O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.

               Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room 
               we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

               O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Keep an eye on her. If you leave her 
                         door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon, 
                         Jonathan.

               Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Me?

               CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking 
               haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and 
               his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking 
               him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed 
               face.

               He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers 
               his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading 
               into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --

               THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files 
               and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket 
               watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he 
               starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                                     O'CONNELL (O.S.)
                         Well, well, well.

               Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

               Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a 
               chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into 
               a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up 
               the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Where's your new friend?

                                     BENI
                         What friend? You're my only friend.

               O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Then you got no excuse for living. 
                         What the hell you doin, being buddies 
                         with this creep, Beni? What's in it 
                         for you?

                                     BENI
                         It is better to be the right hand of 
                         the Devil,... than in his path. As 
                         long as I serve him, I am immune.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Immune from what?

                                     BENI
                         You shall see.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What are you looking for? Lie, and 
                         I'll slit your throat.

               O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

                                     BENI
                         The book! The black book they found 
                         at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. 
                         Said to me it would be worth it's 
                         weight in diamonds.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What does he want the book for?

                                     BENI
                              (shrugs)
                         Something about bringing his dead 
                         girly-friend back to life. He needs 
                         the book...
                              (looks at Jonathan)
                         And your sister.

               O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES 
               O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.

               Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

                                     JONATHAN
                         That looked rather painful.

                                     O'CONNELL
                              (wincing)
                         Ya know, ever since I met you, my 
                         luck has been for crap.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes, I know, I do that to people.

               And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming 
               from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to 
               the window and look out --

               EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

               Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing 
               away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

               A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's 
               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and 
               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

               EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Damn-it! That's two down and only 
                         two to go.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And then he'll be coming after Evy.

               They turn and race out of the office.

               BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

               Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at 
               the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Ten o'clock! All is well!

               The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair 
               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with 
               fear.

                                     DANIELS
                         The hell with this. I'm goin, 
                         downstairs to get me a drink. You 
                         want somethin'?

                                     HENDERSON
                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a 
                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, 
               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his 
               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes 
               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS 
               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is 
               SUCKED out of him.

               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the 
               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a 
               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

               And then it's over.

               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps 
               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, 
               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large 
               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO 
               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is 
               Imhotep.

               INT. FOYER - NIGHT

               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, 
               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth 
               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the 
               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's 
               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.

               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Nice lips.

               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I figured you might be here, so I 
                         brought a friend.

               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively 
               catches it.

               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound.

               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the 
               floor... and drops the martini glasses.

               INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You called me your girl?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, 
                         you know, figure a speech.

                                     EVELYN
                         I think you were jealous

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see 
                         that guy's face?

               Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                                     DANIELS
                         Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do 
                         somethin'! we gotta do somethin, 
                         NOW! Before it's too late!

               They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

               EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins 
               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people 
               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS 
               AND SORES.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

               O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray 
               follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

                                     EVELYN
                         Last month I came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned The Book 
                         Of The Dead.

                                     DANIELS
                         That book we found at Hamunaptra?

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. A notion I was unwilling to 
                         believe.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Believe it, sister. That's what 
                         brought our buddy back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And now he's going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And if he succeeds, the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse.

               The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         The plagues we have seen so far, are 
                         merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. 
                         Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible.

               They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

                                     EVELYN
                         I'm thinking that if the black Book 
                         Of The Dead can bring people back to 
                         life --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of 
                         The Living can return them to the 
                         underworld.

                                     EVELYN
                         Exactly --

                                     O'CONNELL
                         So your sayin', if we find the book 
                         made outta gold --

                                     CURATOR
                         -- And read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You think it'll send this guy back 
                         to hell?

                                     CURATOR
                         Correct, And that's when --

               LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large, 
               CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING 
               up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!'

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         It has begun. The beginning of the 
                         end.

                                     EVELYN
                         Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

               Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

               EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

               The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are 
               locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while 
               CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

               The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the 
               Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

               The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                                     EVELYN
                         Got it!

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got what?

               The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                                     EVELYN
                         Since the black Book of The Dead was 
                         found inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         then according to this, the golden 
                         Book of The Living should be inside...

               Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         What?

                                     JONATHAN
                         What?

                                     DANIELS
                         WHAT!?

                                     EVELYN
                         The golden Book Of The Living, is 
                         inside the statue of Horus.

                                     CURATOR
                         Which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the Anubis statue.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't tell me we gotta go back out 
                         there?

                                     CURATOR
                         If we want to kill the creature, 
                         yes.

               TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway, 
               SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them 
               over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into 
               the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN, 
               The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass 
               across the balcony and down the staircase.

               EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

               Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
               convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob 
               comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs 
               his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

               The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
               of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it 
               up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump 
               inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                                     BENI
                         Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

               Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points 
               a finger at Beni as they race past him.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You're gonna get yours, pal!

               Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

               His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

               EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the 
               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, 
               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He 
               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a 
               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! 
               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them 
               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He 
               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through 
               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE 
               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 
               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the 
               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses 
               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his 
               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way 
               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth 
               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse.

               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring 
               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

                                     EVELYN
                         He's gorgeous.

               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He 
               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it 
               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives 
               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

                                     THE CURATOR
                         He has consummated the curse, now 
                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun 
                         from the dead, then it will be the 
                         end of us, and the beginning for 
                         them.

               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell 
               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, 
               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The 
               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on 
               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Koontash dai na.

               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

                                     BENI
                         Take his hand and he will spare the 
                         others.

               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty 
               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, 
               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, 
               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

                                     EVELYN
                         Any bright ideas?

               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Sorry, fresh out.

               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to 
               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- 
               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Don't do it, Evelyn.

                                     EVELYN
                         I have no choice.

               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes 
               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

                                     BENI
                         Come with me my princess. It is time 
                         to make you mine, forever.

               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

                                     EVELYN
                         All eternity, idiot.

               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

                                     EVELYN
                         You better think of something, because 
                         if he turns me into a mummy, you're 
                         the first one I'm coming after.

               O'Connell almost smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got guts, lady.

                                     EVELYN
                         Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep 
                         them.

               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- 
               RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hey that's mine -- !

               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of 
               Ardeth Ray's grip.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Evelyn!

               The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Be calm. There is still time. We can 
                         stop him yet.

               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep 
               stops and looks back at O'Connell.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         Pared oos.

               Evelyn SCREAMS.

                                     EVELYN
                         NOOO!!

               Beni smiles.

                                     BENI
                         Kill them.

               Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's 
               grip and stumbles forward.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         EVELYN!

               But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

               O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE 
               COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after 
               him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

                                     CURATOR
                         Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

               The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth 
               Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator 
               apart.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a 
               LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

               O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

               The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air, 
               followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE...

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         We gotta get her back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I'm with you, old man. No one touches 
                         my sister like that and gets away 
                         with it.

               O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You know where he's taking her?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the 
                         ritual.

               Jonathan looks worried.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And what ritual would that be?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
                         su-namun back to life.

                                     JONATHAN
                         And how does one do that?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         By reading the Book Of The Dead.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         And then killing your sister.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me?

               Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Imhotep is now able to cross the 
                         desert with great haste.

               Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Begging your pardon, but I wasn't 
                         quite clear on that last part.

               Ardeth Ray ignores him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         If he arrives before us, it will be 
                         too late.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Did you say 'kill' my sister?

               O'Connell smiles.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I know how to beat him to it.

               And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN 

               Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with 
               R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

                               HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

               EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston 
               Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's your little problem got to 
                         do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Not a god-damned thing.

               Winston looks intrigued.

                                     WINSTON
                         Is it dangerous?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         You probably won't live through it.

               This really interests him.

                                     WINSTON
                         By Jove, do you really think so?

                                     JONATHAN
                         Everybody else we've bumped into has 
                         died, why not you?

               Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                                     WINSTON
                         So what's the challenge then?

                                     O'CONNELL
                         To save the damsel in distress, kill 
                         the bad guy and steal his treasure.

               A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives 
               them a snappy salute.

                                     WINSTON
                         Winston Havlock at your service, 
                         sir!

               SAHARA - DAY

               Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the 
               dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to 
               dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it, 
               they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS 
               INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

               Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

                                     EVELYN
                         What just happened?

                                     BENI
                         All I remember is him turning into a 
                         blast of sand,... and then I remember 
                         nothing.

               Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

               INT. BIPLANE - DAY

               The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

               Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

               EXT. SAHARA - DAY

               Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size, 
               he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And 
               a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

               BIPLANE - DAY

               O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise 
               up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees 
               what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the 
               plane into a dive.

                                     WINSTON
                         Hang on, men!

               WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting 
               biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

               O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT 
               FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

               O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and 
               FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the 
               sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw 
               unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

               Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

                                     WINSTON
                         We're going down!

               The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. 
               Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston 
               Havlock LAUGHING.

                                     WINSTON
                         Here I come, laddies!

               O'Connell braces himself for impact,

               SAHARA - DAY

               Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         Stop it! You'll kill them!

               Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare 
               into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes 
               herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

               EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

               The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
               down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls 
               out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed 
               into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Excuse me... A little help would be 
                         useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH 
                         TROUBLE!!

               O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to 
               the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's 
               mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a 
               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell 
               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

               A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the 
               sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and 
               look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides 
               away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane 
               vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

               HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the 
               volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay, now what the hell does this 
                         Horus guy look like?

                                     JONATHAN
                         He's a big fellow with pointy ears 
                         and a face like a falcon.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Got it.

               HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

               Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make 
               their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading 
               into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

               NECROPOLIS - DAY

               Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She 
               stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through 
               the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his 
               rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                                     BENI
                         Keep moving.

               Evelyn gives him a look.

                                     EVELYN
                         You know, nasty little fellows such 
                         as yourself, always get their 
                         comeuppance.

               Beni suddenly looks worried.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah?

                                     EVELYN
                         Oh yes, always.

               Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on 
               his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
               disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I say, look at that.

               He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in 
               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to 
               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Say, gents! You should come have a 
                         look at this.

               The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into 
               Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The 
               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's 
               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being 
               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and 
               Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years 
               ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

               Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC 
               JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking 
               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         From now on, don't touch anything. 
                         Not a damn thing. Keep your hands 
                         off the furniture, got it?

               Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni 
               holds his gun on her, translating:

                                     BENI
                         Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

               Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                                     EVELYN
                         Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but 
                         that it's already taken.

               Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

                                     BENI
                         He wants your heart and your brain, 
                         your liver, your kidneys...

               Evelyn's eyes widen.

                                     BENI
                         ...and how do you say? Those slimy 
                         things, in your stomach?

                                     EVELYN
                         Intestines.

                                     BENI
                         Yeah! Them.

               Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

                                     EVELYN
                         You only want me for my organs?!

               Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

               Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, 
               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and 
               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his 
               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting 
               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a 
               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his 
               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning 
               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT 
               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM 
               FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.

               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. 
               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's 
               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Who the hell are these guys?

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Priests. Imhotep's priests.

               O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         I never killed a priest before.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         They are evil, cursed, they matter 
                         not.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Well, okay then.

               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips 
               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, 
               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the 
               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Oh come on, gimme a break here.

               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning 
               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing 
               out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of 
               Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and 
               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage 
               from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

                                     IMHOTEP
                              (ancient Egyptian -- 
                              subtitled)
                         Kill them! Kill them all! And bring 
                         me the Book Of The Living!

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor 
               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         My turn.

               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit 
               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels 
               and rolls about.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She 
               blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the 
               ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

               The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into 
               the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a 
               passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This whole place is comin, alive!

               The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around 
               another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. 
               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray 
               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         I'm out.

               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of 
               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

                                     JONATHAN
                         There he is!

               They run up to the base of the statue,

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hello Horus old boy.

               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the 
               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a 
               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Allow me.

               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to 
               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes 
               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way 
               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth 
               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         These guys just don't quit.

               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Keep digging!

               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND 
               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST 
               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another 
               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL 
               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

               INT. CEMETERY

               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD 
               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                                     ARDETH RAY
                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!

               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         That's the last one, we better get 
                         lucky.

               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door.

               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock 
               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and 
               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and 
               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty 
               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with 
               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then 
               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

                                     IMHOTEP
                         With your death, my love and I will 
                         be invincible!

               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and 
               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I found it, Evy! I found it

                                     EVELYN
                         Shut-up and get me off of here!

               O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

               The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests 
               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

               EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

                                     EVELYN
                         Open the book, Jonathan! Open the 
                         book! That's the only way to kill 
                         him!

               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, 
               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly 
               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles 
               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I can't open it! It's locked or 
                         something!

               O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his 
               sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along 
               the binder. It hits him like lightning --

                                     JONATHAN
                         We need the key!

               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain 
               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

                                     JONATHAN
                         What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

                                     EVELYN
                         Read the inscription on the cover!

               O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now 
               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell 
               force him back.

               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, 
               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.

               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching 
               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding 
               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES 
               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares 
               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh boy.

               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         This just keeps gettin, better and 
                         better.

               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, 
               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, 
               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her 
               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in 
               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for 
               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

                                     JONATHAN
                         You have got to be joking?

               Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Finish the inscription, idiot!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Oh.

               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best 
               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on 
               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

                                     JONATHAN
                         Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now 
                         what is this last symbol here?

                                     EVELYN
                         What's it look like!?

               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis 
               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's 
               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares 
               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                                     JONATHAN
                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little 
                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, 
                         a stork! on either side.

               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

                                     EVELYN
                         Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

                                     JONATHAN
                         Yes,... I see.

               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!

               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks 
               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell 
               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, 
               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to 
               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily 
               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels.

               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for 
               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden 
               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still 
               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and 
               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you 
                         are without your right arm.

               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him 
               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a 
               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes 
               it off.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Alright,... so he's left handed.

               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up 
               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

                                     JONATHAN
                         I got it!

               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep 
               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS 
               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage 
               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS 
               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in 
               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with 
               him.

               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed 
               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn 
               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, 
               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and 
               casually flings it away.

               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan 
               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something.

               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed 
               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, 
               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About 
               to die.

               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

                                     EVELYN
                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! 
                         PARED OOS!!

               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror 
               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which 
               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out 
               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits 
               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, 
               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of 
               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like 
               he's about to cry.

               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's 
               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One 
               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, 
               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword 
               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across 
               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog. The sword still in his stomach.

               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as 
               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And 
               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at 
               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               Evelyn translates:

                                     EVELYN
                         Death is only the beginning.

               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, 
               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF 
               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons 
               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

               CEMETERY - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         C'mon!

               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick 
               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure 
               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of 
               the sinking walls is deafening.

               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn 
               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a 
               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already 
               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet 
               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, 
               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of 
               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

                                     BENI
                         O'CONNELL!!

               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch.

               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's 
               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over 
               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

                                     BENI
                         Go away.

               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE 
               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the 
               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind 
               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the 
               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

                                     JONATHAN
                         Well,... I guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                                     O'CONNELL
                         Wouldn't say that.

               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, 
               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

                         TUK-TUK-TUK!!

               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag 
               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

 THE NEVERENDING STORY   Based on the book by Michael Ende Screenplay by Wolfgang Peterson 1984   FADE IN:   Limahls The Neverending Story plays as the CREDITS PLAY OVER a dazzling display of some great clouded storm. THE NOTHING. Great masses of clouds swirl and churn and collide on the screen.             As the FINAL CREDITS play we   CUT TO: Bastians bedroom   Our story begins as our young friend awakes from a dream. Bastian quickly sits up as if awakening from a nightmare. He looks at a picture of his mom with a sigh and then he picks up the book beside him and marks his spot.   CUT TO: Kitchen.   Bastians father is working on some sort of concoction in the kitchen blender, while Bastian sits at the dining table straining to open jelly for his toast. They exchange a good morning between each other, but they are relatively quiet.   Father: Morning Bastian   Bastian: Morning Dad   Bastian continues to struggle with the jar until his hand hurts. His father turns to him and gives him a hand. He seems to easily open the jar. As Bastians father returns to his task of the morning drink concoction Bastian breaks the silence.   Bastian: I had another dream Dad, about Mom.   His father pauses at the blender, but doesn't look at him and then he continues creating his drink.   Father: I understand son, but we have to get on with things, right? (Bastian looks dejected at this answer.) Bastian we each have responsibilities. We can't let Mom's death be an excuse for not getting the old job done, right ?   Bastian half-heartedly smears butter on his toast. His father approaches the table and sits down. Time for a father to son talk.   Father: Son, I think it's time you and I had a little talk. I got a call from your math teacher yesterday. She says you were drawing horses in your math book.   Bastian: Unicorns. They were unicorns.(mimics a unicorn)   Father: What ?   Bastian: Nothing.   Father:             She also says that you haven't been turning your homework       in on time. And I'm very disappointed you didn't even try out for           the swim-team.           ( Pause )         As for those riding lessons you've been wanting                                you say you love horses yet you seem to be afraid to get on a real                          one. Now, Bastian, you're old enough to get your head out of the                             clouds and start keeping both feet on the ground. Alright ?                                                         (he takes a sip of drink.)   Bastian: Ok.   Father: Stop daydreaming and start facing your problems.                  Ok ? (ruffles Bastians hair)   Bastian: Ok (he says with a half hearted smile)   Father:                                             Ok. Right I think we've had a nice little talk we should have more. (he gulps down his drink and gets up to leave.) Have a nice day and don't be late to school again.   Bastian: (Bastian turns to him) But yesterday I wasn't   END SCENE   FADE IN: City street   Out on the street 3 bullies are laughing. As Bastian walks out, they stop.   Bully 1: Hey look it's the weirdo.   Bully 2: Hey weirdo, got any cash for us today ?   Bastian turns and runs.   Bully 1: Hey follow! That's it weirdo. You can't get away               you jerk ! You're dead chicken!   They yell chasing after him. They chase him down an alley where they corner him and catch him.   Bully 3: Where's you're money man ?   Bastian: I don't have any!   Bully 1:      No money? Momma's little boy is holding out     on us. You ain't got any money on ya, you go in the garbage can   All three bullies shove Bastian into a nearby dumpster.   Bully 3: Maybe chicken can lay an egg in there. (They laugh as they return to the street.)     Bastian comes out of the dumpster and enters the street brushing garbage off himself. The bullies see him and stand up straight.   Bully 1:              style="mso-spacerun: yes">                  Hey man, who said you could get out of the garbage ? Get back in there. class=MsoBodyText2>  (They smile at each other and start towards him.)   Bastian: Oh no not again. No not again! (He starts running)   Bully 2: Where do you think you're going wimp? (They chase after him, He ducks into a bookstore and the boys run by. )   NEXT SCENE: Coreanders Book store   Bastian watches from inside the store as the three bullies go running by. He sighs felling relief, but is suddenly startled by a ruff bulldog voice from somewhere in the store.   Coreander: Get outta here. I don't like kids.   Bastian walks toward the area he heard to voice from, and finds an old man siting in a chair reading. He turns and looks at him.   Coreander: You still here boy? Didn't you hear what I said?   Bastian: Um, I was.. (he stutters motioning to the door.)   Coreander: You're hiding aren't you?   Bastian: No I was just... (he stutters more)   Coreander: The video arcade is down the street . Here we just sell small rectangular objects that are called books. Require a little effort on your part and make no b..b..b..beeps. On your way please     Bastian: I KNOW books. I have 186 of them at home!   Coreander: Bah. Comic books.   Bastian: No. I've read Treasure Island, Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz, Lord of the Rings, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan   Coreander: Whoa whoa whoa. Who are you running away from? (he says with new interest.)   Bastian: Just some kids from school.   Coreander: Why ?   Bastian: They wanna throw me in the garbage.   Coreander: Why don't you give them a good punch in the nose, eh?   Bastian: Oh, I dunno.(he looks down at his shoes)     The man turns away from him again. Bastian looks at the book he has. His interest has been aroused.   Bastian: What's that book about?   Coreander: Oh, this is something special.   Bastian: (Bastian moves in closer.) Well, what is it ?   Coreander: Look. You're books are safe. While you're reading them you get to become Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.   Bastian: But that's what I like about them.   Coreander: Yes, but afterwards you get to be a little boy again.   Bastian: What do you mean?   Coreander: Listen (he motions for him to come nearer.)   Coreander: Have you ever been Captain Nemo, trapped inside your submarine while the giant squid was attacking you ?   Bastian: Yes.   Coreander: Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape ?   Bastian: But it's only a story.   Coreander: That's what I'm talking about. The ones you read are safe.   Bastian: And that one isn't ?   Coreander: Don't worry about it.   Bastian: But, but you just said it was.... (the phone rings and Coreander puts the book under a newspaper to try and hide it.)   Coreander: Forget about it. This book is not for you. (he gets up and gets the phone.)    Bastian watches him. As he talks on the phone Bastian uncovers the book. The title on the book reads, The Neverending Story. above these words is a symbol on the cover. The symbol is two snakes intertwined with each other and biting each other's tail. As the old man hangs up the phone, Bastian grabs the book and runs out. The old man smiles to himself and looks down at his desk proud to have finally gotten rid of the annoying child.   ANGLE: Coreanders desk   On his desk in place of the book is a note pad barely legible writing on it, it reads: class=MsoBodyText2>  " Don't worry, I'll return your book."   END SCENE   NEXT SCENE: Bastians school.   With the book under his shirt Bastian runs through the hall of his school. He stops outside his classroom, then cautiously looks through the small slit of a window in the classroom door. What he sees is his class already started on a very important math test. class=MsoBodyText2>  Bastian: The Math test, oh no.   CUT TO: school attic   Bastian runs up the stairs leading to the  school's attic, finds the key and goes inside. There are all sorts of old scholastic objects in the attic. He finds a stack of old gym mats and pulls one out. He sits down and pulls out the book, then he begins reading.   ANGLE- Bastian- CLOSE UP:   Bastian: It was midnight in the Howling forest. The wind whistled through the tops of the ancient trees. Suddenly, something enormous crashed and rumbled through the eerie woods.   FADE OUT TO: Fantasia   WIDE SHOT: View of small camp.    We see a snail look up and there's a small man beside him. There is a Nighthob and his sleeping bat nearby. Suddenly the calm of the camp is interrupted by a great rumbling similar to an earthquake.   Nighthob: What's that ?  (the ground shakes.)   ANGLE: Rockbiter   A huge tricycle comes to a stop in front of them. It is made entirely from stone, as is the giant riding it. The Rockbiter speaks to them in a deep, friendly voice.   Rockbiter:  Excuse me, would it be alright if I joined you this evening?   Tiny:                       Uh huh. .   Rockbiter:  You see I've been traveling all day.   (he climbs off his tricycle.He rolls it backward and then sits down. The ground beneath him shakes. He sniffs the air and then says, as if he has discovered a secret of theirs)    Ah hah ! Now I see why you picked this camp. "   He picks up a large rock and sniffs it.   Rockbiter:  A delicious looking limestone rock. Nice bouquet, must be a real vintage here.   Nighthob:  Yes, you're right. Those delicious rocks are the reason we camped here alright.   Then he runs over to the little man.   Nighthob:            Psst. is he a nutcase?   Tiny:                          No, he's a Rockbiter.   Nighthob:      Oh a Rockbiter. A Rockbiter!?     The Rockbiter starts eating the limestone he is holding. Pieces fall all over the place. One piece falls on the snail.   Rockbiter: Ooops, sorry.   Then he burps.   Oh, pardon me !     Nighthob:  Pardoned.   Rockbiter: Mmm. That was limestone, with a dash of quartz. Very tasty. Where I come from in the north we used to have exquisite gourmet rocks, only now...now they're all gone.   Nighthob:       Huh, I know how it happened.     The Rockbiter makes a boyscouts honor sign.   Rockbiter: I swear it wasn't me.   Nighthob: Hah ! Heck no.   Tiny: I think I know what it was, tell us more.   Rockbiter: Near my home there used to be a beautiful lake, but then it was gone.   Tiny:  Did the lake dry up?         Rockbiter: No, it just wasn't there anymore. Nothing was there anymore. Not even a dried up lake.     Tiny:  A hole ?   Rockbiter:  No, a hole would be something. Nah, it was nothing. And it got bigger and bigger. First there was no lake anymore and then finally, no rocks.   Nighthob:  Hah! If he keeps stuffing his face like that, soon there won't be any rocks left here either!    (Nighthob complains to the little man. As he starts to walk away, the little man grabs him.)   Tiny: Nighthob, this could be serious!   Rockbiter, what you have told us is also occurring where I live in the west ! A strange sort of Nothing is destroying everything.   Nighthob: Yes, we Nighthobs live in the south. And it's there too. . Rockbiter: So, so it's not just in our part of Fantasia?   Nighthob:  Maybe, it's already everywhere...   (Nighthob hisses looking around suspiciously smelling the air.)   Maybe our whole land is in danger. What can we do?   Rockbiter:  My people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress for help   Nighthob and Tiny:  We are..   Tiny:  We are on the same mission. After all, if the Empress can't save us, who could?   Nighthob:  Then why are we all just standing around here instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?   Tiny:  Right, what are we waiting for ?     The little man climbs on his snail while the Nighthob tries to wake up his bat. Nighthob: Hey wake up! We can't just hang around here. Prepare for take off! Stupid bat!   Rockbiter:  We, we can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?   Tiny:  Don't worry, it's a racing snail.     Rockbiter: Oh, but we can't even wait for a racing snail.   The little man goes peddling off on the snail. Nighthob finally wakes up his bat and climbs on as   Rockbiter:          It really is a racing snail.   Nighthob: And nobody gives a hoot about me and my stupid bat.   CLOSE UP: Rockbiter Rockbiter: Maybe I'll take a few of these yummy gourmet rocks, eh.. for the road. class=MsoBodyText2>  class=MsoBodyText2>  class=MsoBodyText2>  As he bends down to pick some up, he stands straight up again and realizes he hears the nothing coming.             style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Rockbiter:  Oh no. The nothing! class=MsoBodyText2>  CUT TO: A golden sunset   View of the sky and Nighthob on his bat.   Nighthob:  Look there it is. The heart of Fantasia.             View of Rockbiter and little man. They stop as they see the Ivory Tower.   Rockbiter:  I never knew it was that beautiful. Oh.   EXT. VIEW-Ivory Tower   Wide angled view of the nearing Ivory Tower. It shimmers in its only light as the sun sets behind it. class=MsoBodyText2>  Nighthob:  Stay awake. I told you to stay awake.   We span the whole length of this Ivory Tower. It is said to be as big as a city. We pass over the base of the tower, then its mid section, and finally we near the very top of the structure. It is very intricate here. We begin to zoom in on the Magnolia pavilion. The very tip of the Ivory Tower, the place that the Empress lives.     Nighthob:      The home of the Empress. She's our only hope.   FADE OUT:   INT. VIEW- Ivory Tower- The Empresses court   The door to the Empress's room opens into the courtyard. Lots of creatures from Fantasia await help from the Empress. The Empress's head servant comes out of her room and speaks to them all.   Carion:  Friends, I know why you are all here. The nothing is destroying our world. I also know that you have come to beseech the Empress for help. But I, I have terrible news. The Empress herself has become deathly ill. There seems to be a mysterious link between her illness and the nothing. She is dying. So she cannot save us...   There is much commotion among the creatures gathered there, but he continues.                But there just might be one chance. The plains people who  hunt the purple buffalo have among them a great warrior and he alone has a chance to fight the nothing and save us. He is our only hope. His name is Atreyu.   CUT TO: School attic- Bastian   View of Bastian. He looks up from the book and grabs his school bag. He looks at the Indians on the front.   Bastian:  Atreyu..   Bastian: The Empress had already sent for the great warrior. When he finally            style="mso-spacerun: yes">              appeared on the terrace of the Ivory Tower, he carried with him the hopes of all            Fantasia."   View of a young Indian boy walking up the stairs to the old man.   Bastian:  A little boy   Close up of Atreyu as the old man speaks to him.   Carion: I'm sorry, but this is not the time nor place for children. I must ask you to leave.   Atreyu:  If you don't want me here, you shouldn't have sent for me.   Carion:  It was not you we sent for. We wanted Atreyu.   Atreyu:  I am Atreyu.   Carion Not Atreyu the child, Atreyu the warrior.   Atreyu:  I am the only Atreyu with the plains people, but I'll be happy to go back to hunting the purple buffalo.    Carion:        No wait !   Atreyu pauses as the old man continues..    Come back please.   Atreyu walks back up the stairs. The old man looks at him more urgently now.   Carion:  If you truly are the Atreyu we sent for, you                                                          would be willing to go on a quest?   Atreyu:  Yes of course, what kind of a quest?   Carion:  To find a cure for the Empress .....and to save our world. No one can give you any advice except this, you must go alone and you must leave all your weapons behind. It will be very dangerous.   Atreyu:  Is there any chance of success?   Carion:  I do not know, but if you fail the Empress will surely die and our whole world will be destroyed.   Atreyu's eyes grow large and he closes them and hangs his head down. Then he opens them back up and looks at the old man determinedly. He takes off his bow and quiver of arrows.   Atreyu:  When do I begin ?    Carion:  Now and you must hurry Atreyu, the nothing grows stronger everyday.     He motions him to come nearer. Carion:  Take this. (He holds up a necklace that has the same symbol as the front of the book. He fastens it on Atreyu.)   " The Auryn" Could be heard whispered throughout the court filled with creatures.   Carion:  He who wears the Auryn speaks for the Empress. It will guide and protect you.   END SCENE: view of Atreyu and his horse galloping away from the ivory tower. Fade out   FADE IN: Dark cave   View of a dark cave and we hear   Bastian:  At the same time, elsewhere in Fantasia, a creature of darkness also began his quest.   We see two evil eyes open abruptly followed by a horrid howl in the cave and then a wolf as black as night runs out.   CUT TO: Atreyu & Artax   View of Atreyu and Artax near a stream.               Atreyu is sleeping and we hear   Bastian: They had been traveling aimlessly for almost a week, but they could not find a cure for the Empress. Neither Atreyu or his horse, Artax, had the vaguest suspicion that the creature of darkness, the G'mork, was already tracking them down.   Artax crosses the small stream and wakes up Atreyu by nuzzling him.   Atreyu:  Wha ? What is it Artax. Is it time to go already    Oh, I know what you want. It's time to eat, huh? Good idea.   Bastian:  No, it's a great idea!   Bastian looks up from the book with a smile and grabbs his lunch from his back pack and begins to devour it.     VIEW of Bastian holding half the sandwich. He looks at it.   Bastian: No, not too much. We still have a long way to go.   VIEW of Atreyu and Artax traveling again.   G'mork arrives were they had been and catches their scent, and takes off following their trail.   CUT TO: Swamps of Sadness Bastian:         Atreyu and Artax had searched the Silver Mountains, the Desert of Shattered Hopes, and the Crystal Towers without success. And so, there was only one chance left. To find Morla, the ancient one, the wisest being in Fantasia whos home was the Shell Mountain somewhere in the deadly Swamps of Sadness.   Atreyu jumps off Artax and pulls him along through the swamp.   Bastian:  Everyone knew that whoever let the sadness overtake him would sink into the swamp.     Atreyu pulls his horse along saying reassuring things the whole time.   Atreyu:  That's it. Youre doing fine Artax.   Suddenly Artax stops and Atreyu pulls on the reigns. Artax doesn't budge   Atreyu: Come on Artax, what's the matter? What's wrong? Come on boy!   I understand, it's too difficult for you. (He tries pulling him in a different direction and steps into a puddle up to his waist. Suddenly he notices that Artax is sinking)   Atreyu: Artax you're sinking! Come on turn around, you have to! Now ! Come on! Artax !   He goes closer to him and hugs him. Atreyu:  Fight against the sadness Artax. Artax, please. You're letting the sadness of the swamps get to you. You have to try, you have to care. For me, I'm your friend, I love you.   (Artax doesn't move and Atreyu slaps the puddle sending water flying toward the horse. He yells at him again.)   Artax, you're sinking! Come on, turn around, you have to, now! Come on! Artax! Fight against the sadness, Artax. Artax, please, you're letting the sadness of the swamps get to you. You have to try. You have to care, for me, you're my friend, and I love you. Artax! Stupid horse! You've gotta move or you'll die! Move, please! I won't give up! Don't quit! Artax! Please!   (then he pleads with him.)   Move please. I won't give up! Jump quick! Artax please!   FADE OUT:     FADE IN:   SPLIT VIEW: of Atreyu sitting on a log crying as he looks at the spot where Artax had once been, and of Bastian looking up from the book. Both have tears streaming down their face, Bastian blows his nose on his handkerchief. Bastian turns the page.   VIEW: of Atreyu walking through the swamps crying. He stops suddenly and we see a mountain.                 style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">                 Atreyu: The Shell Mountain.   VIEW: of Bastian as he looks up from the book.               style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 2">                            Bastian:       Morla the ancient one. class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>  WIDE VIEW: Atreyu climbs up the muddy mountain and calls for Morla several times. The mountain      starts moving and he grabs a tree branch. The branch breaks and he slides down the mountain, hurting his shoulder. He lands in the swamp ground below and turns and crawls away to a tree nearby that faces the mountain. He climbs it and sees a giant turtle head coming out of the mountain. Bastian screams and Atreyu and Morla look around.   Bastian sits up SURPRISED. Bastian: But that's impossible, they couldn't have heard me.   Atreyu: Are you Morla, the ancient one?   Morla: Not that it matters but yes.   Atreyu: Please help me Morla. Do you recognize this?               Morla: Well, we haven't seen the Auryn in a long time.   Atreyu: We ? (he looks around) Is there someone else here too?   Morla: We haven't spoken to anyone else for thousands of years, so we started talking to ourselves.   (she sneezes and blows Atreyu out of the tree.)   Atreyu: Morla, I bring terrible news. Did you know that  the Empress is very ill?               Morla: Not that it matters, but yes. Actually we don't care.               Atreyu: If I don't save her, she'll die! There's a terrible nothing sweeping over the land. Don't you care about that? !               Morla: We don't even care whether on not we care.               Atreyu: Do you have a cold?   Morla: No, we're allergic to youth.   Atreyu: You know how I can help the Empress don't you?   Morla: Not that it matters, but yes.             Atreyu: If you don't tell me and the nothing keeps coming, you'll die to! Both of you!             Morla: Die ? That at least would be something.   She starts to sneeze again, but doesn't so Atreyu relaxes his grip on the tree. Unknowing that she can sneeze at any moment.               Atreyu: Please tell me. You said you knew the answer.             She sneezes and blows him out of the tree. She becomes agitated.               Morla: We're tired of sneezing, go away. Nothing matters.               Atreyu: (He climbs back up the tree)   That's not true. If it didn't really matter to you then you'd tell me.               Morla:         Hah hah, clever boy.   Atreyu:         Tell me please !               Morla: We don't know, but you can ask the Southern Oracle.   Atreyu:        How can I get there?               Morla: You can't . It's ten thousand miles away.               Atreyu:         But that's so far.               Morla:       That's right. Forget it. Good night.     CUT TO: School hallway   The school bell rings and Bastian sits up with a start. The school day Has ended and everyone is leaving. Bastian walks out as the lights turn off. The attic is spooky, it is dark and stormy. Bastian grabs his stuff and runs out of the attic, but then comes back, shaking his head.               Bastian:                  No. Atreyu wouldn't quit now.   He starts back towards the mat, but lightning followed by a loud clap of thunder Startles Bastian prompting him to leap backwards. A wolf head from an old school festival falls down in front of him and he screams in terror.   CUT TO: Swamps   View of Atreyu stumbling, exhausted through the swamp. He falls several times and has to stop for rest. His shoulder really hurts him. Atreyu stumbles into a puddle up to his neck and we see the wolf running after him. As Atreyu starts to faint he looks up and sees a dragon coming towards him from high in  the sky. The wolf reaches him right as the dragon picks him up. The wolf howls in anger as he misses the boy.   END SCENE:   FADE IN: Attic- Bastian   Bastian flops down on his back and sighs. Relieved that Atreyu escaped the Gmork and the swamps, but what was that creature that saved him? Bastian sits back up and starts reading again.               Bastian: After days and nights of unconsciousness, Atreyu slowly opened his eyes and found himself in strange surroundings. He was clean and his wounds were dressed.   VIEW: - Atreyu waking up. His is asleep behind the arm of the dog-like dragon. He lifts it's arm so he can get away. The dragon opens one eye, then closes it.               Atreyu: Shew.               Falkor: The dragon wakes up as Atreyu runs away. Leaving so soon, hmm?               Atreyu: Uh, I was just going..... I have to ...... I was trying to ... (he stutters.)               Falkor:             Sneak away?   Atreyu: Yea..... I mean no. No!               Falkor: I like children.               Atreyu: For breakfast?               Falkor: Never ! I'm a luck dragon. My name is Falkor.               Atreyu: And my name is..               Falkor: Atreyu. And you're on a quest.               Atreyu: How'd you know that?               Falkor: You were unconscious and you talked in your sleep.   Atreyu: Wha?               Falkor: (Falkor starts straining to reach his ear, but his leg is to short.) Could you get round and scratch behind my right ear?               Falkor: I can never quite reach it.               Atreyu: (Atreyu starts scratching a spot.) Here?               Falkor: Oh yea. Huh huh huh, oh. That's so good. Thank you.               Falkor: So little fella, you're on you're way to the Southern Oracle?               Atreyu: Yes, but it's hopeless. It's too far away!               Falkor: Oh, I wouldn't necessarily say that.               Atreyu: Do you know how to get there?               Falkor: Why sure, it's right around the corner.               Atreyu: How'd all this happen?!                 Falkor: With luck !               Atreyu: You've already brought me the entire Ten thousand miles?               Falkor: No, only nine thousand eight hundred and ninety one, as the dragon flies.               Atreyu: You're amazing!               Falkor:                       Having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a                      Quest. Things will work out fine Atreyu. Never give up hope and           style="mso-spacerun: yes">       Good luck will find you.               Atreyu: It's good to have a friend again.               Falkor: You have more than one. Look.   (motioning behind Atreyu.)     Atreyu goes to a small entrance and bends down to look in. A tiny old man sits writing in a book and an old lady comes in humming a tune. She throws some worms into a pot and stops to eat one. Atreyu closes his eyes disgusted. Atreyu smile as they start fighting.             Engywook: Get out of my light wench. You're disturbing my scientific work.               Urgl: You and your scientific work. What the boy needs now is one of my potions.               Engywook: The boy will need my scientific advice much more.               Urgl: Yes, yes, but not until he's well. Get back to your own place. I'm always finding you in my place!               Engywook: I'm going.   Atreyu clears his throat to get their attention               Engywook: He's well! Now it's my turn with him.                 Urgl: Oh no you don't! I decide when he's well. It's your turn when I say it's your turn.   VIEW -She gets a cup full of the mixture in the pot and comes to stand in front of him.   Urgl: Well, little man, still in pain ?   He puts a hand on his shoulder as he speaks to her. Testing the bandage.               Atreyu:          Um, a little, but it's all right.               Urgl: I like that. The patient telling the doctor it's all right. It has to hurt if it's to heal.   (She stops and sniffs the cup then holds it out to him.)   Here. Drink that.          (He takes it from her and starts drinking.)               Urgl: Good, huh? That's my batwing broth. There's eye of newt in there, tree mold, old lizard brains, scales from a rancid sea serpent.   Atreyu looks at the cup like he's sick. The old man stands and speaks to him.               Engywook: Just where did you and your dragon come from? What are you onto? Anything of interest to the scientific community?               Atreyu: My name's Atreyu. I came here to find the Southern Oracle.               Engywook: Oh, you've come to the right place my boy.               Urgl:            Here we go again.               Engywook: I am somewhat of an expert on the Southern Oracle.               Urgl:         It's my scientific specialty.        (she mocks Engywook)               Engywook:             It's my scientific specialty.                             Urgl: Why don't you sit down and be quiet for once ?!               Engywook: You keep quiet wench.               Urgl: Oh !               Engywook: It's now my turn.               Engywook:  My name is Engywook. Uh, she's Urgl. Ever heard of me?               Atreyu: I don't think so.               Engywook: You don't move in scientific circles.     Atreyu smiled apologetically and shook his head no.               Engywook: I am the expert on the Southern Oracle. Oh you've come to the right place my boy.               Urgl: There's no fool like an old fool.               Engywook: Wait. Stay here. To the observatory. he says stopping her. To the winch ,wench !   CUT TO: View of Urgl turning a handle of a large machine that pulls a Basket carrying Engywook to the top of a high ledge on one of the surrounding rocks. Atreyu follows him on the ground.               Engywook: Come on lazy bones, can't you go any faster ?   I've been studying the mystery of the Southern Oracle for years, someday I'll publish my book : A Century of Studying The Southern Oracle by Professor Engywook, volume one The Early Years.   Atreyu: Have you ever been to the Southern Oracle ?               Engywook: Well, what do you think? I work scientifically.   As Atreyu pulls himself up on the ledge he sees 2 great sphinx-like statues. The man looks into a improvised sort of telescope and then tells Atreyu to do the same.               Atreyu: Is that the Southern Oracle ?               Engywook: Well, no. It's the first of the 2 gates you must pass through before you reach the Southern Oracle and get me the final information for my book. Of course, most people never get that far.   Atreyu: Why?               Engywook: The sphinx's eyes stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth tries to pass by. Ah ! Here comes one that looks fancy.   VIEW of a man in fancy armor approaching the gate.               Engywook: Let's see what he really thinks of himself   (Atreyu watches through the telescope. The man starts to hesitate.)   Go on scaredy cat. Oh, go on!               Engywook: Oh, it's my turn, let me see.   (Atreyu ignores him.)   I'm the scientist.               Atreyu: He's going on. I think he's gonna make it.               Engywook:                         style="mso-tab-count: 1">            The sphinx's eyes, are they open are shut? Let me see !               Atreyu: They're shut.   (he looks back and forth between them.)   No wait ! The eyes are open !   Rays of pure light shoot out of the sphinx's eyes and zap the man. Atreyu looks up, shocked at the sight he had seen.             Engywook: Oh no! Did he make it ? Did he?             Atreyu: (Atreyu shakes his head.) No.             Engywook: Fancy armor doesn't help much. The sphinxes can see straight into your heart. Listen boy, next time let me see what happens ! It's my telescope.               Atreyu: (Atreyu sets his jaw determinedly.) I'm gonna try it.             Atreyu starts climbing down as Engywook calls after him               Engywook: No ! Don't go yet. I haven't told you about the next gate. It's even worse than this one. Atreyu ! Atreyu !   Atreyu continues on and approaches the gate. As he walks up the eyes stay closed.               Engywook: He'll never make it. He'll never make it.   Atreyu does fine until he sees the fallen man, who is just a charred skeleton. He panics and starts looking back and forth between the 2 sphinxes.               Engywook: (The old man cries out.) Don't start to doubt yourself now ,be confident !               Bastian: (Bastian cries out ) Be confident , be confident.   The eyes open and Bastian cries out.             Bastian: Run Atreyu run !               Engywook: Run Atreyu !   Atreyu looks straight ahead and Bastian calls out.               Bastian: Run now!   Atreyu runs through the gate and just barely makes it. He turns and looks back, then sighs.   Engywook is so happy he jumps in the basket and falls out when he gets back to where Falkor and Urgl are.             Engywook: He made it ,he made it !             View: Urgl is giving Falkor a shot.             Urgl: You could do with a dose of juicy vitamins too.               Engywook: He made it, Atreyu, he made it through the sphinx gate. I always said he could do it.             Urgl:  Oh good ! But that's no reason for you to go falling out of the Basket again?   Engywook: Oh hogwash!               Falkor: I knew he would be safe.               Engywook: Nonsense ! You don't understand anything! The worst one is coming up. Next is the Magic Mirror gate. Atreyu has to face his true self.               Falkor: So what ? That won't be too hard for him.               Engywook: Oh ! That's what everyone thinks. But kind people find that they are cruel, brave men discover that they are really cowards. Confronted with their true selves most men run away screaming ! VIEW: of Atreyu in a blizzard. He approaches the Mirror gate and looks into it.  After a while, he sees Bastian reading the story. Bastian looks up then throws the book across the room.             Bastian: No. This is going too far.   (He pauses and looks at the book.)   What if they really do know about me in Fantasia?   (He picks the book back up.)     VIEW: of Atreyu. He sticks his hand through the Mirror and then pulls it back out. Then he walks through the gate.             Bastian: (Bastian lights a candle) The Southern Oracle?   Atreyu approaches another two sphinxes. As he approaches they start speaking to him.               Oracle:                  Do not be afraid. We will not harm you.                     We have been waiting for you a long time Atreyu.   (they speak in unison.)               Atreyu: Are you the Southern Oracle?                 Oracle: Yes, we are.               Atreyu: Then you must know what can save Fantasia !               Oracle: Yes we do.               Atreyu: Well, what is it ? I have to know.               Oracle: The Empress needs.... a new name.               Atreyu: A new name. Is that all ? But that's easy ! I can give her any name she wants.               Oracle: No one from Fantasia can do it, only a human child.               Atreyu: A human child ? Where can I find one?               Oracle: They can only be reached beyond the boundaries of Fantasia. You must hurry Atreyu. We do not know how much longer we can withstand the nothing.   (The sphinxes start crumbling. Atreyu runs away calling for Falkor.)   VIEW - Falkor with Atreyu on his back. They are flying over Fantasia.               Atreyu: Hurry Falkor, the nothing's everywhere.               Falkor: Don't worry. We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.               Atreyu: Do you know where they are ?               Falkor: I have no idea.               Atreyu: Then how are we supposed to find them?               Falkor: With luck.               Atreyu: Faster Falkor, faster.                 style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 2">                            Falkor: All right ! Hang on tight! VIEW- Falkor carrying Atreyu over many different lands of Fantasia. A beautiful display of landscapes play over the screen then we   CUT TO- Attic window  CLOSE UP of Bastian.                 Bastian: What a shame they don't ask me. My mother, she had such a wonderful name.   He closes the window and goes back to reading the book.   On and on they flew until they reached the Sea of Possibilities where they could go no further.   VIEW of Falkor and Atreyu. The sky is gray and is incredibly windy. Great storm clouds can be seen all around churning and expanding. It is the Nothing, the force destroying fantasia, and Falkor and Atreyu Have ended up right in the center of part of it.               Falkor: Look Atreyu, the nothing.   Falkor is tossed around in all directions, Atreyu tries to hold on as best as he can. The wind blows wilder and wilder until finally it tosses Falkor onto his back, and knocks his passenger into the air. Atreyu falls, but Falkor cannot get to him before he disappears into the chaos below.   CUT TO- Attic   The window bursts open and Bastian climbs up and closes it. Against a torrent of rain and wind. Finally he gets the window closed and he looks down at the book, he is soaked, and a bit winded at his experience. Then he remembers the story hero.               style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">             Bastian:            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">             Atreyu ! FADE TO- View of Atreyu on a lying on a beach. Atreyu wakes with a start, and discovers that the Auryn is gone. He stands up and looks at  the sky, searching frantically for his friend Falkor, but Falkor is not there.               Atreyu: Falkor !Falkor !Where are you? Falkor !   Somewhere in the heavens Falkor is searching for Atreyu.               Falkor: View of Falkor calling for Atreyu." Atreyu ! Atreyu !             Atreyu: Falkor !   Atreyu reluctantly gives up on calling Falkor. He turns his eyes to the beach, he finds a trail of foot prints in the sand, but they were not his, but that of a large beast. Atreyu follows them and Finds himself following a path to a city that has seen better days.On his way he stopps to rest leaning against the remains of what seems like a stone wall, but he soon finds that it was not a wall at all, but a Rockbiter. The giant looks down at atreyu and holds  out his hands.               Rockbiter: They look like big, good, strong hands. Don't they?          (Atreyu looks down saddened.)                      I always thought that's what they were. My little friends.       The little man with his racing snail, the Nighthob, even     the stupid bat. I couldn't hold on to them. The nothing pulled them right out of my hands. I failed.   Atreyu looks down, feeling terrible.             Atreyu: No you didn't fail. I'm the one who was chosen to stop the nothing. But I lost the Auryn, I can't find my luck dragon, so I won't be able to get past the boundaries of Fantasia.               Rockbiter: Listen, the nothing will be here any minute. I will just sit here and let it take me away too. They look like big, good, strong hands. Don't they?   Rockbiter starts crying as Atreyu shakes his head yes and fights his own tears. He continues along the trail again, and finds himself in a different part of the city. Ahead of him is a larce mostly intact building, Atreyu dodges falling rocks and enters an opening.   On the walls are paintings of everything that's happened during his Quest. The Empress giving the Auryn to Carion, Carion giving the Auryn to Atreyu,  Atreyu trying to save Artax in the Swamps of Sadness, Morla, and Falkor, and more.   As Atreyu turns a corner he sees a painting of a wolf, then he turns another  corner and sees the wolf hiding in a smaller opening. It growls wildly at Atreyu as he approaches               Gmork: If you come any closer I will rip you to shreds.   Atreyu squats down where he's at and looks at the wolf.               Atreyu: Who are you?               Gmork: I am G'mork. And you, whoever you are, can have the honor of being my last victim.               Atreyu: I will not die easily. I am a warrior.               Gmork: (G'mork laughs.) Brave warrior, then fight the nothing.               Atreyu: But I can't ! I can't get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.   G'mork laughs and Atreyu grows angry.             Atreyu: What's so funny about that ?               Gmork: Fantasia has no boundaries.   A storm grows closer to the city, slowly shaking it to pieces  Rocks fall here and there.             Atreyu: That's not true. You're lying.               Gmork: Foolish boy. Don't you know anything about Fantasia? It's the world of human fantasy. Every part ,every creature of it, is a piece of the dreams and hopes of mankind. Therefor, it has no boundaries.   There's a crash and more rocks fall.             Atreyu: But why is Fantasia dying then ?               Gmork: Because people have begun to loose their hopes and forget their dreams. So the nothing grows stronger.               Atreyu: What is the nothing ?!               Gmork: It's the emptiness that's left. It's like a despair, destroying this world. And I have been trying to help it.                 Atreyu: But why ?               Gmork: Because people who have no hopes are easy to control. And whoever has control has the power.   A large crash shakes the ground. Atreyu loses his balance for a moment, but quickly regains it and turns back to the wolf. He gives him a cold look then asks him,             Atreyu: Who are you really ?               Gmork: I am the servant of the power behind the nothing. I was sent to kill the only one who could have stopped the nothing. I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness. His name was Atreyu.   The ground shakes and Atreyu falls over backward. He grabs a long, sharp piece of broken stone and stands up. He then yells at G'mork.               Atreyu: If we're about to die anyway, I'd rather die fighting. Come for me G'mork ! I am Atreyu!   G'mork growls and jumps at him. Atreyu plunges the sharp rock into the beasts heart, killing the Gmork. As Atreyu pulls himself from the carcass of the Gmork,  Atreyu finds that the beast managed to inflict a wound on Atreyu. He stands and  winces at the deep gash across his chest. Another crash echoes through the ruins as Atreyu makes his way out of the ruins.   CUT TO- Ocean Falkor under water   Falkor dived deep into the Sea following a slight ray of light from beneath the waves. As he swims deeper and deeper more and more bubbles form around his body, finally he reaches a coral reef, and finds that the ray of light was coming from the lost necklace. Falkor opens his mouth, and plucks the Auryn  from the coral with his teeth.   Driven by a will much like his own he headed straight for the abandoned city. Below him he could barely make out the form of Atryeu leaving a collapsing building.   Atreyu comes out of an opening and latches onto a tree as the Nothing consumes more and more the surrounding land. Atreyu calls out for Falkor and this time Falkor calls back.                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Falkor:      Atreyu, hang on!   Atreyu holds tight to the tree as strong winds threaten to rip him from the branches. Almost as he was losing his grip Falkor plucked him out of the tree, and headed for  safer skies. But that was all there was left, below them the Nothing enveloped the remaining pieces of land. Fantasia was gone.                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Bastian:                         style="mso-spacerun: yes">       That was the end of Fantasia. Only a few fragments remained     of this once rich and beautiful world had been left by the nothing.   VIEW  Falkor flies through a belt of fragments still remaining after the Nothing. The sky is  graveyard of left over pieces of Fantasia. Atreyu wakes from his exhaustion and looks around with a heavy heart.               Atreyu: Good old Falkor, can you see anything ? Anything at all ?               Falkor: No, all the land is gone.               Atreyu: I know, and all because I failed.               Falkor: You tried.               Atreyu: Do you suppose the Ivory Tower is still standing?               Falkor: Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.   Atreyu looks down at the amulet dangling from his neck, and gets an idea  that might just help them.               Atreyu: Let the Auryn guide you.   (He clutches the medallion with his hands )   If the Ivory Tower still stands take us there. CLOSE UP-   VIEW- The Auryn starts glowing and the fragments move, behind them standing  in all its glory is the ivory tower.               Atreyu: Falkor ! The Ivory Tower !   They approach the tower. And it appears to have been spared by the Nothing. We span over all its beautiful features before we come to rest at the court before the Empresss chamber.   VIEW-  Bastian. He leans forward and whispers                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 2">                            Bastian: The Empress       VIEW- Atreyu walks up the stairs that lead to the Empress's room. The chamber door begins to open. He pauses and looks back at Falkor.               Falkor: Go on.   He enters the room and the door closes behind him. Before him was the Childlike Empress in person. She sits silently on her bed, her gaze never leaves Atreyu.               Childlike Empress:                         style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-spacerun: yes">        Atreyu, why do you look so sad?   He takes off the Auryn and hands it to her.

The one who can save us all.               Atreyu:                You knew about the Earthling child ?!               Childlike Empress:                         Of course. I knew everything.               Atreyu: (Atreyu grows angry with her)   My horse died, I nearly drowned, and I just  barely got away from the nothing. For what ?! To find out what you already knew ?!               Childlike Empress:                                            It was the only way to get in touch with an Earthling.               Atreyu:                                                   But I didn't get in touch with an Earthling !                    Childlike Empress:                                                                            Yes, you did.   Bastian sits up slowly as we hear what she's saying.               Childlike Empress:                                     He has suffered with you. He went through everything you went                                      through. And now, he has come here with you. He's very close.                                                        Listening to every word that we say.             Atreyu looks around, as does she.                           style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            Bastian:                         style="mso-tab-count: 2">                        style="mso-tab-count: 1">            style="mso-tab-count: 1">            What ?!   Two fragments of Fantasia collide and explode shaking the Tower Violently.                         style="mso-spacerun: yes"> Atreyu:  Where is he ?

                    REVISED SECOND DRAFT

                    February 27, 2003

FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN
CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.

DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR
and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.

ANGLE ON THE SHRUB
where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER
from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
in the front door and sees...

DREW'S POV
The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
it close:
                           SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL
             Where are you going, Jelly Bean?
                                                CUT TO:

                                                      2.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)
which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW
WAGGING.
From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20
T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:
THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.
Parker snickers, types her return from...
NOTATWIN:   CONFESS
THOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.
NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.
THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE
COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.
This makes her smile.
NOTATWIN:   A CAREER MAN.   I LIKE THAT.
                                            CUT TO:

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says, "tweezers."
She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                         3.

CONTINUED:
She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
psychotic.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
them.
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.
                           PARKER (O.S.)
             Morning.
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water
pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off
the water pick, dries her face.
                           PARKER
             Why the young executive look?
                           DREW
             I have my interview at NYU today.
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new
belly ring.
                           DREW
             No way Mom knows about that.
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt
down.
                           PARKER
             And she never will. At least
             until after I'm married.
                           DREW
             Didn't it hurt?
                           PARKER
             Like hell.
Drew shivers.
                           DREW
             Piercings are so... unhygienic.
A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        4.

CONTINUED:
                           DREW
             Breakfast.
Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her
Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-
apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear
line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the    Koreas.
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry:
THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?
NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?
THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.
NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET.
THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL
NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D
LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.
Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes
downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein
model-type.
                           PARKER
                     (suddenly wide-awake)
             Hellooo, Warren.
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces
off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
nah.
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
her open DAYBOOK.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         5.

CONTINUED:
DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously
together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he
takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.
                             DREW
             Morning, Dad.
                             CHARLEY
             Morning, baby.
                           DREW
             How's the book coming?
                            CHARLEY
                     (sigh)
             Well, sweety, my writing process
             is a lot like a giant
             hydroelectric dam. For a long
             time I just let the great ideas
             build up and build up until the
             sheer weight of them spills over
             and the words just come pouring
             out.
                           DREW
             Still stuck, huh?
                             CHARLEY
             Not a word.
Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her
pop, then takes a sat.
Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
Drew.
Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker
can turn it over.
                           DREW
             Another one for the trophy room,
             huh?
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         6.

                            PARKER
             Boys can be fun. You should try
             one some time.
                           QUINN
                     (to Drew)
             You ready for your interview?
                           DREW
                     (funny you
                      should ask)
             I've prepared a color-coded
             itinerary based on dividing the
             day into fifteen minute increments
             alternating blue/red, double-
             checked the train schedule,
             confirmed with the Weather Channel
             and rehearsed a couple of
             alternate scenarios last night,
             you know, just to account for all
             the possible glitches.
                           PARKER
             We'll take that as a yes.
                           CHARLEY
             I'm proud of you for sticking to
             your plan all these years, sweety.
                           PARKER
             I still don't understand why you
             want to finish college in two
             years? What's the big hurry?
                           DREW
             I want to hit the ground running.
             All those football games and the
             partying and the whole dating
             scene. It just seems like a lot
             of wasted time that could be spent
             more productively.
                           QUINN
             The Accelerated program would look
             great on your med school
             application.
                           PARKER
             Football games I get. But
             partying? A waste of time?
Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                           CHARLEY
             To each her own.
                            QUINN
             Well, Drew.   I have a surprise.
Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.
                           QUINN
             I took the day off.
                     (excitedly)
             I'm going into the City with you.
                           DREW
                     (panicked)
             What -- ?!
Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out
her nose.
                           QUINN
             Isn't that great! We can do some
             shopping, have lunch, real girl
             stuff. Won't that be fun?
                           PARKER
             If you want to have fun, I'm the
             one who should go, not Mother
             Teresa over there.
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.
                           PARKER
             Let me know if you want me to do
             the Heimlich. It'd be cool to
             have you owe me your life.
WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air.
                           QUINN
             You okay?
                           DREW
                     (still clearing)
             No... I mean, it's... impossible.
             I've got every minute accounted
             for right up to the interview.
             Blue and red! It won't work.
                           QUINN
             I just thought... you know... I've
             been working and we haven't had a
             chance to spend much time
             together...

Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up.
                           QUINN
             ... and both my babies are going
             away to college next Fall.
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker
follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.
                           PARKER
             Don't be sad, Mom. Just think,
             when Drew leaves for school, you
             won't be losing a daughter, you'll
             be losing an anal-retentive social
             misfit who will be voted most
             likely to die a virgin.
Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.
                           DREW
             I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet
             of you. But don't worry. Parker
             will be living here with you
             forever since no college on earth
             will ever take her.
                           QUINN
             Stop it, you two.
Mom blows her nose.
                           PARKER
             It's not fair you guys get to go
             into the City and I don't.

             Don't you have a chem test, young
             lady?
                           PARKER
             Chemistry? Please. Name one time
             you ever used chemistry in your
             life.
                           CHARLEY
                     (beat)
             Good point.

             going to    be a doctor. I can't
             even say    the word 'orifice,' let
             alone put    a finger up one.
The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.
Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
news that her mother's going to accompany her.
                           DREW
                     (worried)
             Time to go.

INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING
Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost
trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits
down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
present DATE:
CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR-
CODED AND ACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT UP TO...
2:07 -- PROFESSOR QUE SPAULDING, CHAIR, NEW YORK
UNIVERSITY ACCELERATED STUDIES PROGRAM, ADMINISTRATION
BUILDING, SUITE 101.
                           QUINN (O.S.)
             Come on, honey! Let's tear up
             Manhattan!
With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the
mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
and tries some self-reassurance.
                           DREW
             You're smart. You're resourceful.
             You'll find a way to make it work.
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.


EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING
Quinn hops in her Saab.
ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.

                                                   10.

INT. QUINN'S SAAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
RING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed,
checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and
prays.
                         QUINN
                  (to phone)
          Doctor MacLeod...
                  (beat; winking
                   at Drew)
          I'm sorry, but my itinerary is
          booked solid today. Call Dr.
          Wessels. He's covering for me.
                  (beat)
          He did?
                  (beat)
          Are you sure it's the baby's head?
                  (beat)
          All right. I'm coming.
Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound
disappointment, turns to Drew.
                         QUINN
          I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light
          special in Maternity. Every bed's
          full and some poor woman is about
          to give birth in the gift shop. I
          have to go in.
Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.
                        DREW
          Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.
          It's like fate is conspiring
          against us.
                        QUINN
          I know.
                        DREW
          You absolutely, positively have to
          promise me we'll do it another
          time.
                        QUINN
          I promise. I better hurry. Have
          Parker drop you at the train
          station on her way to school, will
          you?
Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                         11.

CONTINUED:
                           QUINN
             Kill 'em in that interview.
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             Mom, you know, I might not get in.
                           QUINN
             Are you kidding me? You're Drew
             MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody
             works harder and nobody, and I
             mean nobody, is ever more
             prepared.
Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in
her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course
her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.
                            DREW
             Hey!   Stop!
Drew takes off running after the car!
                            DREW
             PARKER!!

EXT. PHILADELPHIA TRAIN STATION - MORNING
Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station.


INT. THE GIRLS' HONDA - MORNING
Parker pulls up to the curb at the station.       Drew
collects her bag.
                           PARKER
             Good luck with your interview.
Drew pauses, holding the door open.
                           DREW
             You know, Parker. Chemistry is
             important. When you think about
             it, everything's made of
             chemicals.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         12.

CONTINUED:
                           PARKER
             Oh, I'm interested in chemistry.
             Just not the kind with all the
             numbers and stinky test tubes.
Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the
seat next to her.
                           PARKER
             Ah, chemistry.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
Drew finds a seat.     She neatly folds her jacket and sets
it next to her.
She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen
goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.
After laying out her interview materials, she turns to
her reflection in the window.
                           DREW
                     (low; rehearsing)
             Professor Spaulding. Good
             afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.
An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his
Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.
EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring
off into their own world, wondering why their life has
lead them to this sad moment when...
... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE
singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,
wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
train car.
Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.
                           DREW
             What do you think you're doing?
                           PARKER
                     (too loud; with
                      headphones on)
             Looking for a seat.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        13.

CONTINUED:
                           DREW
             This can't be happening. Wait, I
             know. This is one of those Ground
             Hog Day dreams, isn't it?
Drew pinches herself too hard.
                           DREW
             Ow!
                     (to Parker)
             I'm awake now. You're supposed to
             disappear.
                           PARKER
                     (still too loud)
             You know, I just got this itch.
                           DREW
             Then scratch it and get back to
             school.
                           PARKER
             I couldn't concentrate anyway.
             I'm too... distracted today.
                            DREW
             You're permanently distracted.
             It's called Attention Deficit
             Disorder.
                     (spotting her
                       Blackberry)
             Is this about that chat room guy?
             It is, isn't it?
A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and
she pulls them off.
                           PARKER
             No! It's about spontaneity, which
             you obviously wouldn't know
             anything about.
                           DREW
             I swear to God, Parker, you go
             through boyfriends like Junior
             Mints. It's pathetic.
                           PARKER
             Pathetic? You want to talk about
             pathetic?! At least I don't count
             getting accidentally felt up in
             dodge ball as my first date!
                           (MORE)

CONTINUED:
                           PARKER (CONT'D)
             You're going to be eighteen and
             you've never even HAD a boyfriend!
The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?
                           DREW
             Is this any of your business?
He goes back to his paper.
                           DREW
             This is ridiculous. I don't    have
             time for this today. Fine.      Don't
             graduate from high school.     Make a
             mess of your life over some
             complete stranger. I don't     care.
             But leave me out. I have
             something important I need    to
             accomplish today, so please    go
             away.
                            EXECUTIVE
                     (to Parker)
             Would you like this seat so you
             two can fight?
                             DREW/PARKER
             No thank you.
Drew's ALARM WATCH BEEPS.
                           DREW
             I have to mentally preview my day
             now. I can't talk anymore.
Parker turns to go, then remembers something.
                           PARKER
             Uh, Drew? Do you have any money?
             I don't have enough for a ticket.
Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her
sister.
The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with
the old paternal reprimand look.
                            PARKER
             Please.   Like you never ditched
             school.
                                                 CUT TO:

                                                    15.

INT. SECOND TRAIN CAR - MORNING
Parker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle
Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.
                        PARKER
          'You don't know how you met me...'
But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of
the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and
slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.
                        PARKER
          Excuse me.
Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-
taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.

INT. THE TRAIN - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
the coast is clear.
Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.
                        CONDUCTOR
          Ticket, please.
                         PARKER
          Why don't I save the b.s. story
          and just ask you to cut me a break
          this one time because I know
          you've got a big heart and you
          remember what it was like when you
          were young and... and...
                  (off the Conductor's
                   look)
          ... randy?


EXT. TRENTON STATION PLATFORM - MORNING
Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on
the train into the FIRST CAR.
                        PARKER
                  (calling after)
          I guess you were never young and
          randy!
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,
smiling and giving her a little victory wave.

                                                     16.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take
when he sees Drew.
                           CONDUCTOR
          Very funny.
                           DREW
          Excuse me?
                           CONDUCTOR
          Let's go.
He takes her by the arm.
                        DREW
          What are you doing?
Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.
                        CONDUCTOR
          I tried to be nice about it, but
          if you want the police involved,
          this is the way to do it.
                           DREW
          Police?     I didn't do anything.
                        CONDUCTOR
          No ticket, no train ride.
                        DREW
                  (realizing)
          No! That's not me! That was my
          twin sister you threw off!
                        CONDUCTOR
          Young lady, in thirty years I have
          heard every possible line but
          that's the lamest ever.
                        DREW
                  (pointing)
          She's right there!

ANGLE ON THE PLATFORM
No Parker.
He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,
SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAIN
CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS,
OUCH!
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       17.

CONTINUED:
IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANT
IN TIME WITH DREAM GUY?
BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES.     He smiles:
                            DREAM GUY
             You okay?
                            DREW
             I'm... ouch.
                           CONDUCTOR
             She's fine, considering she should
             be in jail.
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
Dream Guy share a last look before she's...
... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her
wits about her.
                             DREW
             This   can't be happening! I have
             a...   a... little paper thingy.
             What   are they called? Ticket! I
             have   a ticket! It's right...
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her
hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
in the mess.
The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.
Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor
spots    her. He looks from one sister to the other --
oops,    mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs
inside    and the train is gone.
                           DREW
                     (to the gods)
             AARRGGH! PARRR... KERRR!
Parker steps up from behind her.
                           PARKER
             You get kicked off, too? Why
             didn't you just buy a ticket?
Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but
Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.
                                              (CONTINUED)

             Don't.
                           PARKER
             What happened to your head?
                           DREW
             Oh, just a minor concussion I
             sustained while the Conductor was
             throwing me off the train because
             he thought I was you sneaking back
             on the train!
                             PARKER
             Sorry.
                             DREW
             I'll bet.
Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the
ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a
doozey.
                             PARKER
                       (calling after)
             I am!    Where are you going?
                           DREW
             To see when the next train
             leaves.
                             PARKER
             I already --
But Drew's inside the stationhouse.
                          PARKER
             -- did. They said something about
             a delay.
Parker follows into the stationhouse.

INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew's standing in a
long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold
shoulder on...
... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.

                                                   19.

EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - STREET SIDE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION
Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She
scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
"Wilcox."
                        EXECUTIVE #2
          That's me.
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
Parker raises an eyebrow.    Hm.
The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.

INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION
Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK
who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of
angry commuters.
                        DREW
          That can't be.  I have to be there
          before two!
                        TRAIN CLERK
          Well, maybe if you flap your arms
          real fast you can fly there,
          because you won't get there on a
          train.
                        DREW
                  (about to explode)
          What did you just say?
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                         20.

Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.
                            PARKER
             Come on.   Hurry. I got us a ride.
                           DREW
             Let go of my arm.
But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at
the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.

EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.
                            DREW
             What's this?
                            PARKER
             A car service.
                           DREW
             Car service? You couldn't have
             called for a...
But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a
thousand times.
                            BENNIE
             Morning, miss.
                           PARKER
             Good morning. Thank you.   My
             sister's coming, too.
Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only
got this instant to consider. She glances at the
STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,
engulfing it.
                           PARKER
             You want to make that interview,
             or not?
Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the
door and waddles around to his side.


INT. TOWN CAR - MORNING
Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and
afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.
                                                (CONTINUED)

             So you're headed to the Teamster's
             Hall on Second Street?
                           PARKER
                     (chewing a lip)
             You know, Mister...
She checks his Chauffeur's License up front:        Benjamin
Loyola.
                              PARKER
             ... Loyola.
                              BENNIE
             Bennie.
                           PARKER
             Mr. Bennie? We have a slight
             change of itinerary. We need to
             go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th
             will be fine.
Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.
                              BENNIE
             It's pre-paid.     No skin off my
             nose.
                           DREW
                     (whispering
                      throughout)
             Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?
                              PARKER
                        (whispering
                         throughout)
             Barneys.
                              DREW
             Not Barneys.
                           PARKER
             We've got five hours.     Relax.
He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go.
Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's
going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.
                           DREW
             This was supposed to be someone
             else's car, wasn't it?
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        22.

CONTINUED:
                            PARKER
             So?
Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on
the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can
read:
                            DREW
             'Scarpelli'?   We're supposed to be
             Italian?
                           PARKER
             Northern Italian.
                           DREW
             This is so... wrong.
                           PARKER
             What? You need to get to that
             interview. We now have a ride.
             We will pay for the ride. End of
             big deal.
This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.
                            BENNIE
             Yeah?
                     (beat)
             No.  The city.
                     (beat)
             What'a you talkin' about?
Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the
girls...
                           BENNIE
             I already got 'em.
... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he
listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets
worse.
                           BENNIE
             They're right here in the car.
                     (to girls)
             'Scuse me.
Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's
left the intercom button on so they can still hear his
half of the conversation.
The girls are PETRIFIED.

                     (swallowing)
             What's happening?
                            BENNIE
                      (to phone)
             Don't you think that's a little
             severe? I mean, they didn't see
             nothin' yet. They can't hear
             nothin'.
YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.
                             BENNIE
             You're the boss.
                      (beat)
             Take it easy. I'll fix it.
                      (beat)
             No, I don't have a shovel. Not
             today. It'll be a big mess.
             Besides, I just had this suit
             cleaned.
The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR!
                           BENNIE
             I'll take 'em to the wharf, what
             difference does it make?
Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.
                            DREW
                      (whispered terror)
             Parker, I think maybe we should
             get out.
Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.
                            PARKER
             I agree.   How about... NOW!
Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her
door open and pulls Drew into the street!
An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for
the sidewalk.
                            BENNIE (O.S.)
             Hey?!   Where you goin'?!

                                                     24.

EXT. JERSEY SIDEWALK - MORNING
They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race
around the first corner, looking back over their
shoulder.
                         PARKER
           He's stuck at the light!
VRROOOM!   Here comes the Lincoln storming around the
corner.
                         DREW
           He has no respect for traffic
           laws!
They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a
GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back
out, the same way they came.
SCREECH!   Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS!
They round the same corner going the opposite way and
Parker pulls them into the first door...

INT. MINI-MART - MORNING
... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the
magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese
Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR
DEFENDS CROWN."
Parker peers over the top and out the window.
PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street,
Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.
                         DREW
           Is he gone? I can't believe this.
           What did you get us into?
                           PARKER
           We lost him.    Wow. That was a
           rush.
                          DREW
           A rush?   Are you out of your mind?
                          BUM (O.S.)
           Hey.   Give me a quarter, will ya?
Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY
with a Slushee in his hand. They stand. Parker reaches
in her pocket.

             I don't have any change, but here.
Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew
reaches over to stop her...
                            DREW
             Parker, you're only feeding the
             poor man's disease. Buy him a
             healthy snack.
... just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and
the SLUSHEE IS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND.
We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE
CAP FALLING OFF AND THE STICKY, CHERRY RED MESS FANNING
OUT UNTIL...
... BACK TO FAST MOTION -- SPLAT!     IT CATCHES DREW FULL-
FACED, DRENCHING HER.
The Homeless Guy snags the dollar.
                           HOMELESS GUY
             I gotta go.
And he EXITS.     Parker SNIFFS.
                          PARKER
             Ew. That stinks. That's not just
             Slushee.
The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.
                           MINI-MART CLERK
             It's Mad Dog. Look at that mess.
             It's gonna smell up the store all
             day.
Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker
speaks for her.
                           PARKER
             May we use your bathroom please?
The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down
Drew's blank face.
                           MINI-MART CLERK
             Gas station at the end of the
             block. Have a nice day.

INT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING
BURT, who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to
the girls. The key is attached to a full-sized STEERING
WHEEL. Burt SNIFFS, wrinkling his nose.
                        BURT
          You know, it's not my place to
          say, but you young girls got your
          whole lives ahead of you. You
          shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour
          of the day.
                        PARKER
          That's what I keep telling her.

          'Round the side.

EXT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING
The girls practically have to drag the key around to the
restroom on the side.
Parker puts the key in and slowly... slowly...
CREAKING... opens the GATES OF HELL
ON THE GIRLS -- WHO STARE IN HORROR INTO THE ABYSS FOR A
BEAT, THEN:
                         GIRLS
          AHHHHHHH!!!!
                                            CUT TO:


INT. BUS - MORNING
Sitting side by side. A YOUNG MOTHER sits in front of
them with her NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY who's standing on the
seat facing the girls.
Drew's BUMP on her forehead is large and inflamed, her
hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number
four and glucose. She is in a REALLY BAD MOOD, only
staring straight ahead.
Parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to
lighten up her sister's mood.
                        PARKER
          Everything's going to be fine.

             ... we'll both look back on this
             and laugh our butts off.
BLECCH! The BABY PUKES all over Drew.       She looks
sideways at her sister.
                           DREW
             I will never, ever, forgive you.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING
The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on
the sidewalk.
                            PARKER
             See?   New York. We made it.
                           DREW
             I could be arrested for vagrancy
             looking like this.
                            PARKER
             Listen.   I've got an idea.
                           DREW
             No. No ideas. I'm going straight
             to that interview and wait,
             without moving or speaking,
             especially to you, for four hours.

             get a nice room, you can take a
             shower and I'll swap clothes with
             you! Simple as that!

Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.

                      (dawning realization)
             Oh.   My. God.
                           PARKER
             Where's your, uh, stuff?
                           DREW
                     (near coma)
             I left it in his car.
                             PARKER
             Oh.
                           DREW
             He knows where I live. He's going
             to hunt me down and kill me.
                            PARKER
             Come on, Drew. I don't think even
             the Mafia kills people just for
             scamming a ride. Quit being
             paranoid.
                     (beat)
             So, we don't do the Plaza. I've
             got...
Parker digs in her pockets.
                           PARKER
             Six dollars and thirty-two cents.
                           DREW
             That won't get me hosed down at a
             car wash.
                           PARKER
             What are we thinking? You've got
             your secret-safety twenty!
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             My secret-safety twenty. Of
             course. But it's only for
             emergencies.

Parker looks her sister right in the eye.
                             DREW
             Yeah.
Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls
out a twenty, then realizes:
                           DREW
             Hey, how'd you know about my
             secret-safety twenty?
                           PARKER
             That's not important now. But
             let's just say that it's a good
             thing for you I think those shoes
             are so ugly I never borrowed them.
                     (pointing)
             Hey, how about there?
Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:
THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.
                           DREW
             No. I want to get clean, not
             contract hepatitis.
                           PARKER
                     (sotto voce)
             Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six
             cents.
                           DREW
             We touch nothing.
Parker leads them inside.

INT. THE RITZY PLAZA
This looks like a good place to get your throat cut
fighting over a dime's worth of crack.
There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the
"desk" which is       behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a
rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead
houseplant. An        old easy chair leaks stuffing.
                             PARKER

Above, a BABY SCREECHES. Something BREAKS.        Then a

             Keep your pants on. What'dya

The girls look behind them, nobody.       Behind the bars?
Still nobody. What the hell?
                           DESK CLERK (O.S.)
             I don't got all day.

             We need a room... with a shower.
             Just for an hour.
There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor
and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the
counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know
what he was doing behind the counter.
                            DESK CLERK
             Sixty bucks.

             for half an hour.
                           DESK CLERK
             Maybe if you two were in school
             you could figure out that half a
             sixty is thirty.
                           PARKER
             We've only got twenty-five.

             I had a little accident, okay?

             All right, all right, don't    get
             your underwear in a bunch.     As a

             twenty-five.
He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach
between the bars.
                           DESK CLERK
             Ten-dollar deposit on key.

             What part of 'That is all the

             next thing you know, you two are
             telling everybody, hey, this
             midget was a real sap. We gave

                               DREW
             Not a word.      Girl Scout's honor.
He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it
and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out.
ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet
where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her
shoes.
There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in,
then:
                              DREW
             AHHHHHH!!!!
Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.
                              PARKER
             Drew?!   DREW?!
Parker follows her.
                           DESK CLERK
             Come back with my key!
The Desk Clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and
follows them into the street.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL - DAY
Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and
the Desk Clerk in tow.
Laying the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker
-- he's a midget, but he's got wheels.

THEM BOTH INTO THE LINE OF AUDIENCE MEMBERS, WHO THEN
TOPPLE LIKE DOMINOES.

Parker pulls Drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key,
tossing it away from them, sending the Desk Clerk
scrambling after it.
The two girls HIGH TAIL IT around the corner.       Winded,
they stop.

             Parker, it was not 'our' money and
             this is not 'our' day in New York.
             What it is, is quite possibly the
             most important day of my life.
             I've resigned myself to the fact
             that you don't give a crap about
             what you do with yours, but if you
             could find it in your heart, your
             tiny, cold steel heart, to respect
             what this means to me, I would
             appreciate it.
But Parker's not listening.       She's staring intently...
... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked,
the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.
Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee.       Parker spots him
and freezes.
                           DREW
             You're not even listening. That's
             typical. Look, we're splitting
             up. Give me back my secret safety
             money.
                             PARKER
                     (still looking past
                       Drew)
             You know how I told you not to be

             Paranoid?

             What I meant was, it isn't
             paranoia if someone really is
             chasing you.
Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew
should look across the street.
                           DREW
             What's wrong with your eyes?

Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.
                            PARKER
             Quiet.   Don't run. He'll see us.
Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off
quickly down the street.
ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them
out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his
coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.
                           DREW
             HE SAW US!
The girls break into a run.
                           DREW
             How'd he find us?
                           PARKER
             Maybe it's just coincidence!
                           DREW
             Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE
             GOING!!
She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.   Oops.
                           PARKER
             Come on!
Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they
weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE
CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
Parker spots a fresh pile of...
... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,
however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her
eyes.
                           PARKER
             Jump!
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,
we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors.

                                                    36.

INT. THE PLAZA - GIRLS' POV - DAY
IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap
off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he gives it an Italian
salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb
it's clear: He's lost the girls.

DREW AND PARKER
                        DREW

                           DREW
             Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is
             shot to hell! Blue, red --
Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS.
                           DREW
             I don't even know what that means!
             I'm running out of time.
                     (noticing)
             Is that guy looking at me?
Parker starts to look.
                           DREW
             Don't look.
                           PARKER
             When you ask a question like that,
             the person is going to look.
Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the
lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY
(MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on
them.
                           DREW
             I think he was.
                           PARKER
             Drew, we haven't done anything.
                           DREW
             Yeah, but I'm standing in the
             lobby of the Plaza looking like a
             deranged street person who might
             attack at any moment. In fact, I
             might attack at any moment.
The ELEVATOR behind them opens.
                           PARKER
             Let's go.
The girls slip into the elevator.     When it closes,
Morty's watching.

INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA - DAY
The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end
of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the
corner.

                           DREW
                     (whispering)
             What are we doing? And why am I
             whispering?
                           PARKER
             We're getting you a shower. Blake
             Greer pulled this at the Sheraton
             after the prom.
                           DREW
             Great. Now we're emulating Blake
             Greer, voted most likely to commit
             a felony before having to shave.
                           PARKER
             We're not going to steal anything.
             We're just going to sneak in, use
             a little soap and water and get
             out.
                           DREW
             Oh, we're not going to steal
             anything. Super. Just a little
             'breaking and entering.'
                            PARKER
             We're not going to break anything.
                     (beat)
             We are going to enter, however.
                               DREW
             No.   No.   No.
                           PARKER
             Shhh... here comes somebody.
DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO
BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.

ANOTHER ANGLE
REVEALS -- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and
Drew aren't the only ones watching. A PAINTER with one
lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully
peeks around the corner.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             It's the New York Kennel Club,
             Emile, not the New York
             Knickerbockers. Please call the
             caterer and cancel the beer.

                                                          39.

CONTINUED:
The ELEVATOR OPENS       for them and they step in. Parker
RUNS LIKE HELL for       the door of their suite... it's just
about to close when       she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST,
just getting a hand       on it.
She lies there on the floor, holding the door and
WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.
                                PARKER
             Hurry up!
                                DREW
             No!
                            PARKER
                     (beat)
             I didn't want to have to do this,
             but... look in the mirror behind
             you.
ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.
                                                CUT TO:

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - DAY
Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the
suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.
                           PARKER
                     (tentatively)
             Housekeeping?
                                                CUT TO:


INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
At the end of the hallway, the PAINTER watches the suite
door close. Hm. What are those girls doing?

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE
It's lavish, yaddada yaddada.
                           DREW
             I can't do this.
                           PARKER
             Drew, you're not a criminal. You
             just smell like one. This way.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                    40.

CONTINUED:
Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master
bedroom and slowly OPENS them.
There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of
the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED
HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he
may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply
eyes them. He might even be smiling.
                           DREW
             Oh, no.  Oh my god. A... a...
                     (puzzled)
             What the hell is it?
                           PARKER
             A dog?
                           DREW
             I'm itching already.   See?   Are my
             arms red?
Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.
                           PARKER
             Key down. I'll take him in the
             living room and keep a lookout.
             You just get in that shower.
Parker approaches The Emperor.
                           PARKER
                     (baby talk)
             Hi, little guy. You don't look so
             tough, huh? You don't look much
             like a dog, actually. More like
             Woody Woodpecker.
Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps
into Parker's arms.
                           PARKER
             You're cute, aren't you, in a
             freakazoidal kinda way.
She takes him into the living room and moves to the door.
                           PARKER
             Was your daddy a rat? Is that it?
             Well, I still like you.
Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to
keep a lookout.

                                                       41.

PARKER'S POV
The hallway's empty.
But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into
the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's
play!

BACK TO SCENE
                        PARKER
          Come back here, little ratdog.
          Come to Mommy Parker.
Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to
keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to
spook him into running away from her, she steps into the
hallway.


INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA
But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and
dashes down the hallway.
                           PARKER
          Bad ratdog!
She chases him down the hallway     and then around the
corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder,
until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic
sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is
COVERED.
Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see
the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his
arms.
                         PARKER
                   (breathless)
          Wow.   Thank you.
                          ROGER
                 Thank you. Bye bye.
          No.
He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked
EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after
him:
                        PARKER
          That's not your dog!      Hey!

                                                        42.

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER
as they open   and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY (Morty) steps
out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry...
... a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos'
suite.
                                              CUT TO:

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - MASTER BATH - DAY
Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky
clothes and gets ONE FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS:
                       HOUSE SECURITY GUY (O.S.)
          Hello? Mrs. Lo Biancho? House
          security!
POOR NAKED DREW FREEZES. THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING ON ITS
AXIS. Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling
it off its hanger and covering herself.


INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
The SECURITY GUY snoops toward the bedroom doors. Just
as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open,
SHADOCK, clocking him and dropping him.
Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the
living room. Just as she reaches the hallway, Parker's
there, also at a dead run and they don't even break
stride.

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
                        DREW

          There's a man in there!
                        PARKER
          Somebody took the dog!
They reach the end of the hallway and are TRAPPED.
Only one out. Parker HUFFS OPEN the window to the fire
escape and they climb out...

EXT. PLAZA ALLEY FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
... and scurry down the stairs only to find that THE
LADDER DOESN'T REACH.

Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a DUMPSTER
with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the
alley.
                             PARKER
             Hurry up!
But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters,
she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around
herself.
                           DREW
             I'll, uh, go around.
                           PARKER
             Are you out of your mind?!    It's
             only a little ways! JUMP!

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers
down the hallway.
BEHIND HIM Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho get out of the
elevator:
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
                     (peeved)
             When competing in a dog show, best
             to bring one's dog along, yes?
                           MR. LO BIANCHO
             I thought you had him, dear.
                            MRS. LO BIANCHO
                      (holding up her hands)
             See?   Empty.
But now they both notice the DOOR to their suite is wide
open.
                             MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Oh, dear God!
The elderly couple do their version of a panicked run
inside.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO (O.S.)
                     (screeching)

             KIDNAPPED MY BABY!

ON MORTY -- making an abrupt halt. Baby?!          He turns
around and lopes back to the suite.

Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape.

             Yes you can!


ANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY
where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised        to see
the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but
they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he
quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the       back and
sides: "Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece         every

Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention.
She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears
around the corner into traffic.
Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the
dumpster.

                     (astonished)
             I did it.
Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for
it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK --
nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE
ALLEY at Parker's feet.

             OW!
                           PARKER
             Get out of there!
                            DREW (O.S.)
                     (beat)
             Give me... my... curtain.
Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They
hurry off down the alley.
IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears.
                             MORTY
             Stop!    Bring back that dog!
MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A
small dog could easily be concealed under that shower
curtain.
ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker.
                           DREW
             He thinks we have the dog!
                           PARKER
             A painter took it!
                              DREW
             A pain --
WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a
BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her,
brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands
RIGHT ON TOP OF       HER.

CONTINUED:
It's DREAM GUY from the train and for a confused BEAT
they look into each other's familiar faces where we read
recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:
                           DREAM GUY
             You know, one of us is gonna get
             hurt if we keep doing this.
O.S. SIRENS signal that the police are now involved.
                           PARKER
             Hey, complete stranger!      Get off
             my sister!
Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.
                           DREW
             I'm, uh, late for this place,
             thing, where I'm supposed to be.
             College. Interview!
                             DREAM GUY
             Where at?
But Parker's got her by the arm and she can only call
back over her shoulder...
                             DREW
             NYU!
... before disappearing into the CROWD on the sidewalk.
                              DREAM GUY
                        (too late)
             Me, too!
AROUND THE CORNER comes Morty who, without time to react,
trips headfirst over Bike Messenger Guy.

EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF PLAZA - DAY
The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP
CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly
take a left into...


EXT. THE OTHER ALLEY ADJACENT THE PLAZA - DAY
Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door --
locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine
providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out
while the girls step inside.

                                                     48.

INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE - DAY
Chaos. MODELS, DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, "I ONLY DATE
MODELS" GUYS and the famous couture fashion designer,
BOBO, are mid-show and friggin' frantic.
                        BOBO
                  (French accent)
          Where are they?! No more breaks!
          Do you hear me! We have a show to
          do, you nitwits! Models! BAH!
          You have hollow gourds for heads!
          The kind they make those Mexican
          rattles out of!
                           SHOWRUNNER
                     (always at his elbow)
          Maracas.
                        BOBO
          Maracas! Maracas that take coffee
          breaks when I am paying them a
          FORTUNE!
Bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and
physically grabs them both, pushing them at the
Showrunner.
                          BOBO
          Hair!  Makeup!
                   (Parker)
          Daywear!
                   (Drew)
          Clubbing! Vite!
This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair,
running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.
Hm. Does he like it?
                        BOBO
                  (confess)
          Is that Helmut Lang?
                  (recovering himself)
          Go!
The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other --
Drew looks at her -- what the hell? Parker CLEARLY
MOUTHS: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS
virtually surround them.
INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the HAIR
STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES.
The rest of the team stops, watching him make his
decision. He shrugs.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                           HAIRSTYLIST
             Perfection.
He excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into
couture.
                                              CUT TO:

DRESSING TEAM - A MOMENT LATER
And   the DRESSING TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing
her   in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit.
She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls
her   eyes. Boring.
The DREW TEAM parts and    we are stunned to see they've
chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW
OUTFIT that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix
and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini.
ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in
the movie, speechless.
                           DREW
             Why does this not surprise me?
THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs
Drew...
                           DREW
             Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be
             going to my college interview.
                          SHOWRUNNER
             That's rich. A model going to
             college. What next? Talking
             monkeys?
... and pushes her through the curtains and...


INT. RUNWAY - DAY
FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles
forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk.
ON THE AUDIENCE -- ALSO SPEECHLESS.
This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a TV
MONITOR at the end of the walk.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           50.

CONTINUED:
Her first instinct is to RUN, but suddenly THE AUDIENCE
HAS DECIDED -- IT'S A SMASH! THEY APPLAUD MADLY! BRAVO!
BRAVO!
Drew recovers herself a bit.        Wow.   They're clapping for
me?

INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE
Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots
Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN)
through the back door. Uh-oh.
The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her
onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker
takes the initiative and...


INT. RUNWAY
... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she
was born to it.
Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the
APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...
... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy
executive! and leans into her sister:
                           PARKER
                     (whispering)
             The hotel guy's here.
The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS
draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into
PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the
artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!
BRAVA!
Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing
kisses and heading for the girls.
                           PARKER
                     (louder)
             And the police.
Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their
hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty
peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off
the front of the stage into the audience like punks
jumping into the mosh pit.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they CROWD SURF
toward the rear of the room.
                           DREW
             Everybody washed their hands,
             right?

ANGLE ON MORTY
Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the
catwalk. Realizing he'll never get through the crowd,
he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but...
THE CROWD ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE
PLANT.
                           HOGAN
             I guess that explains why he's a
             security guard.


ANGLE ON THE GIRLS
who bust out the back doors of the large room and
unwittingly...

INT. THE PLAZA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
... right back into The Plaza lobby.
                              DREW
                        (realizing)
             Perfect.
                           PARKER
             Is this what they call 'returning
             to the scene of the crime'?
Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they
have to pass by...
... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT,
BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs. Lo
Biancho.
When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind
them, however, there's no choice.
The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible
heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         52.

CONTINUED:
                           PLAZA MANAGER
             I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo
             Biancho, The Plaza will do
             everything in its power to see
             that The Emperor is safely
             returned and that the criminals
             are brought to justice.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Justice?! I want them executed!
             Tortured first, slowly, and then
             beheaded!
                           PLAZA MANAGER
             The Plaza's policy is of course to
             serve you in any capacity we can.
Morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach
the revolving doors.
                             MORTY
                       (calling)
             Bruce!    10-80 at the wagon wheel!
Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but
Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees...
THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets
there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is
tossed headlong into the lobby.
Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of
the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward
and sandwiching her in the revolving door.
                             DREW
                       (no breath)
             Park...
OUTSIDE -- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce,
Morty and the cops close in. Quickly, Parker pushes the
door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.

EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Then, Parker HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning
it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in.


INT. LOBBY OF THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The four men all stand there, watching the spinning door.

CONTINUED:
                           MORTY
             Damn it!
Then, just    to their right, an ELDERLY WOMAN walks through
the regular    door just adjacent the revolving doors. All
four share    a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have
thought of    that -- then BOLT outside.

EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The police and security look left, right, across the
street.
                           BRUCE
             Where'd they go?
                           HOGAN
             They couldn't have gone very far.
             We'll split up.
                     (pointing)
             You go that way! You take Fifth!
             Come on, get on your horse!
Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in
separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner
moves.
                           WILLIAMSON
             Coffee?
                           HOGAN
             Sure.
Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up
next to a NEWSPAPER STAND.
                           WILLIAMSON
                     (to hot dog vendor)
             Two black.
                           HOGAN
             Where do you think those two went?
                           WILLIAMSON
             Beats me. They didn't have any
             stupid dog with them from what I
             could see.
                           HOGAN
             Might have stashed it.

                           WILLIAMSON
             Maybe they ate it.
The cops giggle at this.
                           WILLIAMSON
             The rent-a-cop said the mutt's
             worth like 50 G's. That makes it
             grand theft, my friend. Five to
             ten.

ANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND
where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two
policemen.
                            HOGAN
                      (to blind cashier)
             Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a
             couple of blondes run past here,
             did you?
                           SPEEDY
             Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real
             criminal types. Looked like they
             were headed to Mexico.
                           HOGAN
             That's where they all go.


ANOTHER ANGLE
REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter
right next to Speedy.
                           WILLIAMSON
             See you around.
                           SPEEDY
             Not if I see you first.
The cops head back to The Plaza.
                           HOGAN
             I say we put Abbott and Costello
             on the ransom watch. I don't want
             to be stuck in the same room all
             day with Leona Helmsley's nasty
             stepsister.

With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and

                           DREW
             We didn't steal it, I swear.
                           PARKER
             A painter did.
                           SPEEDY
             You girls best give yourselves up
             and tell 'em the story.
                            DREW
                     (torn)
             He's right, Parker.
                           PARKER
             Of course he's right. We're going
             to march in there and give
             ourselves up right this minute.
             They will, of course, take us down
             to the precinct, call Mom and Dad,
             we'll give our statement, they'll
             grill us under hot lights for a
             few hours, force us to confess
             with some tricky good cop/bad cop
             routine and the next thing you
             know we're doing five to ten in
             Attica.
Drew checks her watch.
                           DREW
             So we'll turn ourselves in right
             after the interview.
                           SPEEDY
             May I make one suggestion?

             We're facing felony charges,

             Oh my God. Warren works in the
             city.
                           DREW
             Warren? WARREN?! So you lied,
             right to my face. No, Drew, this
             isn't about the chat room guy.
             Nah!
But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on --
she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a
newspaper peers down at the strange sight.
                           SPEEDY

             Parker, you have completely lost

Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe,
Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his

Nicholson in THE SHINING, just keeps typing "All        work and
no play..."
When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his
chair. He hunts it down through the MAELSTROM on his

             I'm going into the City to meet

             I'll swing by NYU afterwards and

He hangs up and of course veers into the other lane

          Do you see him?
Parker consults the JPEG PIC on her Blackberry, then
scans the group.
                         PARKER
          No.
At the head of the group, the U.N. TOUR GUARD, geeky in a
Clark Kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not
a male model, leans into a petite BRUNETTE and her LITTLE
SISTER.

                  (conspiratorially)
          I can't tell you how much I've
          looked forward to this.
The Brunette looks at him like he's a serial killer.
                         BRUNETTE
                   (in Russian)
          Momma?
Her fierce-looking BABUSHKA MOM gets in the Tour Guide's
face.

          Sorry.   My mistake.
This is when Drew notices Williamson and Hogan ENTERING
and approaching a U.N. SECURITY GUIDE, flashing their
badges.
                         DREW
          Oh, shit.   What now?
                         PARKER

          Warren? Does anyone know Warren
          Collier?

The Tour Guide, WARREN COLLIER, looks over at them.
                           WARREN
             Parker?
Warren moves back to Drew and Parker.
                           PARKER
             Gee, Warren. Isn't that strange?
             I didn't recognize you from your
             picture.
                           WARREN
             Yeah, I, uh...
                           DREW
                     (urgently)
             We don't have time for this now.
                           PARKER
             Do you have an office or someplace
             private we could go?
                           WARREN
             I just have to do this tour and...
But Williamson and Hogan, led by the U.N. Security Guy,
ENTER the lobby.
Drew grabs Warren by the arm and turns him.
                           DREW
             We'll get back to that.
                           WARREN
             What's going on?
Parker looks Warren right in the eye.     This is a test.
                           PARKER
             It's important.
                            WARREN
                     (beat)
             Okay. Let me get somebody to
             cover for me.
Warren leads them into a small adjoining office...

                             ANGIE (TOUR GUIDE)
             No way.    Judge Judy's on.
Drew grabs Angie by the collar, lifts her up.
                             DREW
             Angie?    Take the 11:00.

                     (to Warren)
             You owe me, Warren.
Angie heads out to take the tour.        Parker turns on
Warren.
                           PARKER
             Are you a lying sack, or what?
                           WARREN
             What was I supposed to do? I
             liked you. If I'd sent a real
             picture, would you have met me?
                           PARKER
             That's not the point.
                           WARREN
             That means no. At least this way
             I got to see you before you blow
             me off.
                           DREW
             No one is blowing you off, Warren.
             As a matter of fact, we're very
             happy to see you, aren't we,
             Parker?
                             PARKER
             I guess.
                           DREW
             And we're grateful for your help.
                           PARKER
             This is my sister, Drew.

                           WARREN
             Yeah, well. I guess everybody
             would like the world to see them a
             little bit differently than they
             are.
                           DREW
                     (quickly interjecting)
             Super. Now that that's all
             settled, is there a restroom I can
             get to without going out there?
                           WARREN
             What's wrong with going out there?
                           PARKER
             Police, for one thing.
                            WARREN
             Police?   I thought you guys were
             joking.
                           PARKER
             It's the kind of joke that will be
             a lot funnier a few years from now.
                            WARREN
             Well that door's the only way out.
             There's a restroom at the end of
             the main hall.
Parker opens the office door, peeking out.
                            DREW
             They there?
                           PARKER
             I don't see 'em.

by the office door.

             They must be searching the

                            DREW
             Let's go.
With Warren leading the way, they EXIT the office.

INT. U.N. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
The three make their way across the vast lobby, but
before they reach the main hall...
                            HOGAN (O.S.)
                      (spotting them)
             Hey!   You two! Stop!
                            WARREN
             This way!
Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS,
Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right.
Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn,
another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth.
Even while running frantically, she tries to smile
politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S
room and quickly ditches inside.


INT. U.N. - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and
puts her feet up. She tries to catch her breath.
GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her.
Somebody's in BAD SHAPE.      Another HEART-RENDING GROAN
can't be ignored.

             Drew.
                           CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             Drew... it's vitally important.
A FILE FOLDER comes skidding from under the stall.
                             CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             Please.    You have to take this to
             Canada.
                             DREW
             Uh, Canada?    It's sort of far away.

                     (struggling)
             In the Assembly. Give the file to
             Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian
             representative.
                     (GROANNN!!)

Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door.

                             CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             To the left.    Run!
Drew peeks out the door.       It looks clear.   Out she goes.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MAILROOM
On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked
MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan appears from around the
corner.

INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vacant and quiet. The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan
ENTERS. It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks
piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies.
An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty
ASSEMBLY ROOM.
Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of
the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up.
                           WARREN
          He's gone.
Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's
an awkward moment of attraction between them.
                        WARREN
                  (no better idea)
          You have nice breath.

          Thank you.

          Maybe we should get out of this
          sack.

INT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY
Drew peeks in through the door, reading the COUNTRY
IDENTIFICATIONS on the desks... Bangkok, Borneo,
Bulgaria... Canada.
The REPRESENTATIVES are in the middle of a heated DEBATE
that we hear being translated (and we see in subtitles).
                        CHINESE REP
                  (Chinese; subtitles)

The CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE is sitting gingerly in his
chair, shifting uncomfortably. He looks pale, shaky.
Drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his
desk with the file.

                      (whispering)
             Sir?
He puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling.

                      (ugh; groan)
             Yes...
                           DREW
             Oh, no. You didn't have the
             mussels at lunch, too, did you?
Even as she holds out the file, he races past her,
puckering his bum.
She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE
PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE U.N. SECURITY GUY IN THE
DOORWAY.
Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she can do to
make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian
Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of
the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files
around.
Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone
else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one
on.

ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVE
Williamson's gaze comes to rest on...
... THE BACK OF DREW'S HEAD.         Hm.   That looks familiar.
This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points
an accusatory finger at Drew!
                           CHINESE REP
             This crisis falls at the feet of
             one nation and one nation only!
             CANADA!
ALL EYES TURN TO DREW.

             How do you defend such a position!
             The world is waiting to hear!
These are fighting words. The Assembly grows SILENT.
Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet.
She gulps air. Glances left, right.
BUT SHE KNOWS THE DETECTIVE'S EYES ARE ON THE BACK OF HER
HEAD AND SO SHE CLEARS HER THROAT AND:
                           DREW
             Well, I'm not certain...
This furrows some brows.

                     (recovering)
             ... that I NEED to defend our
             position!
Ah, yes, some knowing nods.

with the NORWEGIAN REPRESENTATIVE:

             Beats me.
                             NORTH KOREA
             She's hot.

             Weird hairdo.

             Absurd?!
Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the
bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for
emphasis.

This draws a CHORUS OF MURMURS throughout the hall. The
Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to
confer with his ASSOCIATE.

             And besides, who said absurd is
             necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd
             is good! For instance, absurd can
             be sort of... funny! In conclusion,
             I propose that all of you should
             talk amongst yourselves.
                     (quickly)
             Thank you.
Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the

INT. LOBBY OF THE U.N. ASSEMBLY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker
come running with the Detectives chasing them. The three
of them make for the front door but a TOUR GROUP comprised
of a hundred young JAPANESE GIRLS blocks their EXIT.
Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE.
                        WARREN
          Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT!
SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, the Japanese Girls all pour
outside, Warren and the Girls following.

EXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY
Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN.
                        WARREN
          Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!
The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE
DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT.
The three of them run for the line of taxis.
                        PARKER
          You speak Japanese?
                        WARREN
          I may not look like an underwear
          model, but I'm smarter than a
          hundred of them put together.
Warren grabs a Taxi door.
                        WARREN
          Come on!
                        PARKER
          We don't have any money!
                        WARREN
          I'm smart AND rich!
Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through
the little Japanese Girls.
Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they
head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just
ahead of...
Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar-
chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab
up ahead.

                                                      76.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION
They jump into the back seat, Warren in the middle.
Parker leans urgently into the DRIVER:
                        PARKER
          Follow that... uh...
                        DREW
          They're following US, Parker!
                         PARKER
          Oh, yeah.   JUST GO!
The TAXI pulls away from the curb.

INT. DETECTIVE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Williamson FIRES UP the CRUISER.
                        WILLIAMSON
          Maybe we should give them a little
          leash and see what they do with
          it.
                        HOGAN
          Fine. But we're gonna have to
          stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause
          I'm getting heartburn.
They pull into traffic, following the Cab.
In a BEAT, Bennie's Town Car follows, too.


INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Parker leans across Warren to Drew.
                        PARKER
          Excuse me, what were you doing?
                        DREW
          Someone was sick in the bathroom
          and they asked me to -- hold on, I
          don't owe you any explanation.
                        PARKER
          You're the one all 'I gotta get to
          this interview or I'm gonna have a
          nervous breakdown' and yet you
          have time to address the United
          Nations?

             You know, technically, you have to
             have security clearance to enter
             the Assembly.
                           PARKER
             Not now, Warren.
                           DREW
             You have a lot of nerve, Parker.
             It was you that got me tossed off
             the train! You had to give the
             bum that dollar! You get the
             suit, I get the leather bikini!

             Which isn't so bad.
                           DREW
             And you got Bernie Lipscomb while
             I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad!
                           WARREN
             Who's Bernie Lipscomb?
                           PARKER
             I told you, I didn't know you
             liked him! It was no big deal!
                             DREW
             It was to me!
                           PARKER
             How could I know? You never tell
             me anything!
                           DREW
             There's a good reason for that!
                           PARKER
             What's that supposed to mean?
                            DREW
             You know very well what it means,
             Ms. Big Mouth!

             Oh yeah? Well, the joke's on you,
             because there isn't any interview!
Oops. This just slipped out in anger.        Parker's brain
has to adjust, then:
                           PARKER
             What?
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             No interview. I screwed up.
                           PARKER
             You screwed up what?
                           DREW
             Scheduling the interview.    You
             deaf?
                           PARKER
             You're Drew. Drew doesn't screw
             ANYTHING up, let alone scheduling.
             You're the Iron Chef of
             scheduling.
                           DREW
             I missed the deadline.
                           PARKER
             How?
                           DREW
             After they made the first cut from
             the preliminary application, we
             were supposed to send in a form to
             secure our interview time and I
             filled it out and had everything
             ready to go in the mailbox and
             then...
Drew is near tears.
                           PARKER
             And then what? Earthquake?
             Tsunami? Nuclear winter?
                           DREW
             I forgot.
                           PARKER
             Forgot?

CONTINUED:
                           DREW
             Yes. I just forgot. When I found
             it in my bag a week later, I'd
             missed the deadline.
                            PARKER
             So today?   All this?   What are you
             doing?
                           DREW
                     (humiliated)
             I... I was going to try to meet
             Professor Spaulding and...
                           PARKER
             You were just going to jump him?
                           WARREN
             Sort of a guerilla interview?     You
             know, I'm a big Michael Moore
             fan...
A look from Parker quiets Warren.       Drew's choked up.    She
just nods, yes.
                           DREW
             I called and the secretary said
             there were no exceptions to the
             deadline so I was going to try to
             see him when he finished the other
             interviews. I knew it was
             hopeless, but... I was so...
             embarrassed.
Drew wipes her tears, then:
                           DREW
             Oh, to hell with it.
She opens the door and jumps out!
                            PARKER
             Drew?!   Drew, get back in this
             taxi!
Parker starts to open her door on the TRAFFIC SIDE! HONK
HONK! It's nearly SHEARED OFF by a passing truck and she
closes it just in time.
                           WARREN
             She's pretty upset.

                           PARKER
             Gee, you really are a genius.
As the taxi bogs down in traffic, Drew disappears around
the corner up ahead.
                           PARKER
             Talk about spontaneous.

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one
stupid shoe. She nearly turns her ankle.
                            DREW
             Darn it!   DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT!
This is when she sees, parked just down the block...
ROGER'S VAN with "Michelangelo's Painting" across the
back door.
                           DREW
             That's... that's the painter.
Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep
out of sight and watch the van.

             Maybe that's what they want us to

             not interfere. In any case,
             little man, we just want the dog
             back before showtime, do you
             understand?

             Okay.
                             MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Ciao.
She hangs up.        Roger does, too.
                           ROGER
                     (to The Emperor)
             No wonder you look so happy. As
             far as you're concerned, you've
             escaped from the Wicked Witch of
             the West.

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN
Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the
street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs
The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag.
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York
Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.
Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The
Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in.
The dog pokes it back out.
                           ROGER
                     (to Emperor)
             Knock it off.
Whoosh! From behind, DREW GRABS THE EMPEROR and takes
off running.
                             ROGER
             Hey!    Give me that dog!
Holding The Emperor at arm's length, Drew makes a run for
it with Roger after her.
ON DREW -- LOOKING RIGHT INTO THE SMILING MAUVE FACE OF
THE EMPEROR.
                           DREW
             I just want you to know that I'm
             allergic to you AND cynophobic!
She and Roger race right past...
... Mr. Lo Biancho, holding out the Saks bag of money.

             I can't stop!    I have to return
             this dog!
                           ROGER
             I'll be right back!
Puzzled, Mr. Lo Biancho falls in line behind Roger,
keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut.

             these girls don't have anything to
             do with this dog.
Drew blows past them, holding The Emperor. The
Detectives exchange glances -- nice hunch -- and they
LEAP OUT OF THE CAR TO JOIN THE CHASE.

The Emperor's having the time of his life. He licks

DREW'S DOG-SLOBBERED POV
REVEALS A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN doing security at the
DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where SHOW PARTICIPANTS,
wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by two
SHOW OFFICIALS.


BACK TO SCENE
Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN, determined to reach
him and hand over The Emperor:
                         DREW
          Officer?!   Officer?!
But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the
Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.   He
turns and goes through the door just as...
... Drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the
stairs.
                           DREW
          Officer?!
She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking in
CONTESTANTS.

A GROOMER combing a HOUND DOG points toward the CURTAINS

CLOSE ON THE HOUND DOG -- lifting his big nose in the
air, he sniffs mightily and then...
BAYING LIKE HE'S COON HUNTING UNDER A KENTUCKY MOON, the
Hound Dog leaps off his table, heads after Drew.

EXT. LOADING DOCK (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN) - CONTINUOUS

CHAOS.
The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS,    sporting nifty sweaters and
manicures, are prepared    to sacrifice their lives to block
the door. In addition     to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get
inside, they're holding    off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho,
Williamson and Hogan.
                           SHOW OFFICIAL #1
                     (quite disturbed)
             No entry without official

At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE. He
slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.

             I'm so sorry, Mr. Lo Biancho. Go
             right in.
AT THE CORNER, Parker and Warren keep their distance, not
wanting to be seen by the Detectives.
                           WARREN
             You think she made it?

She holds up The Emperor.
                           DREW
             I, uh, just wanted to return him.
As the other OWNERS and HANDLERS gather their dogs,
Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs. Lo Biancho while
Hogan handcuffs Drew.

             interview. I'd never lie to the
             police...
                     (it's over)
             ... never mind.
Just as they push her head down into the car, she
glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad GAWKERS
-- it's the Bike Messenger. For just an instant they
lock eyes before the car pulls away.

DOWN THE STREET
Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time
to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back
window.
                           WARREN
             What now?
                           PARKER
             We have to go to the jail and tell
             them what happened.
                           WARREN
             What on earth did happen?
                           PARKER
             Poor Drew. She wanted to get into
             that program more than anything in
             the world.
With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into
Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.
                           BENNIE

She's paralyzed with fear.

             anything and I'll swear to that in
             a court of law!
Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying
to meet death with dignity.
                           PARKER
             Just not in the face.
                           BENNIE
             What's the big idea? You two a
             couple a nutbags or somethin'?
She opens one eye.
                           PARKER
             Nut bags? No. I mean,    yes. Is
             there a right answer to  that?
             See, my sister had this  interview
             which turned out not to  be an
             interview, really and I  sort of
             messed things up because  I wanted
             to meet him.
Indicating Warren.
                            WARREN
             Really?   You came into town just
             for me?   Wow.
                           PARKER
             Not now, Warren.
                     (back to Bennie)
             Drew was going to be late even
             though technically she wasn't
             going to be late since there
             wasn't an interview and that's
             when we got in your car. I
             promise we meant to pay. It was a
             true emergency.
                           BENNIE
             I meant, why you runnin' when I'm
             trying to give you your bag back?
Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag.      Parker takes it,
still trying to comprehend.

             pretty badly for that big
             interview. Listen, I gotta go.
             It's my mother-in-law's birthday

             bush and then take her out to
             dinner at the Pier. See ya

Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in.

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY
Red points at Drew's one shoe.
                            RED
             Do you mind?   I'm a fanatic for
             Jimmy Choo.
                           DREW
             It's all yours.
She hands the high heel to Red, who enthusiastically
pulls it on and models it.
                            HOGAN (O.S.)
             MacLeod?
Hogan ENTERS, opens the cell door.
                           HOGAN
             You're free to go.
                           DREW
             No thanks. I'll just stay here
             with the girls.
                           HOGAN
             An eyewitness says he saw who took
             the dog. Didn't realize the guy
             was stealing it until he saw us
             grab you.
Hogan takes her by the arm in a fatherly way and leads
her out.



INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY
Hogan leads her into the lobby where Bike Messenger Guy
is waiting. He stands up when he sees Drew. Her
dissonance is even more confounded now.

             I don't even know him.
                           HOGAN
             That's what he said. Go home.
             Get cleaned up, a good night's
             sleep. None of this will seem so
             bad in the morning.
Hogan leaves them alone.       Bike Guy steps over.
                             BIKE GUY
             You okay?
As an answer, Drew merely points to herself -- look at
me? Now answer for yourself.
                           BIKE GUY
             I'm Jim Wessler.
                             DREW
             Thanks, Jim.    How'd you know?
                           JIM (BIKE GUY)
             Who could forget that face?
Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face.
                             DREW
             Huh.    No hives.
Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew
becomes self-conscious.
                             DREW
             Well... bye.
She walks past him out the door.
                             JIM
             Wait.    Where are you going?
EXT. NYPD STATION HOUSE - DAY
Jim catches up to her.
                           DREW
             Thanks for getting me out of jail
             but I have to go home now because
             my entire life is ruined.

             You turn understatement into an

             Please?

                     (sigh)
             I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who
             won't be going to the NYU
             Accelerated Program.
                             JIM
             Why not?
Drew looks at her watch.
                           DREW
             Because short of flying, there's
             no way to get from here to NYU in
             five minutes.
                             JIM
             Sure there is.

EXT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING
Parker's on the stairs with Drew's DAYBOOK open, staring
into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes
but forgot to show up for the semester.
Warren's looking over her shoulder.
                            WARREN
             Wow.   And I thought I was anal.
                           PARKER
             This is no good. I don't do too
             well with the whole rehearsal
             thing. I'm more of a 'wing it'
             person.
Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass.
Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a
conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.

             You know, I've always had a thing
             for librarians.
                           PARKER
             Warren, honesty is fine. But you
             could edit a little, you know?
                             WARREN
             Got it.
                             PARKER
             Wish me luck.

INT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - CLOSE ON A HAND
about to knock on a door that reads "Professor Que
Spaulding, PhD" when the door suddenly opens and the last
INTERVIEWEE steps out in a suit and tie, confidence
oozing.
Parker nods primly as he passes, then steps inside.


INT. OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
A SECRETARY sits at her computer.        She looks over her
glasses at Parker.
                           SECRETARY
             May I help you?
                           PARKER
             I'm here to see Professor
             Spaulding.
                           SECRETARY
             You don't have an appointment.
                            PARKER
                     (beat)
             Um, no. However...

CONTINUED:
This is when the inner office door swings open and the
PROFESSOR himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the
other, steps out.
Parker positions herself directly in front of him,
cutting off his EXIT.
                           PARKER
             Professor Spaulding?
                             PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Yes?
                           PARKER
             May I have a moment of your time?
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             I'm sorry, but I have a plane to
             catch.
He tries to make a move.      Parker blocks him.
                          PARKER
             I know. But this is very
             important.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             What is this about?
                           PARKER
             Life and death, if you must know.
The Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving
Parker her opening. She grabs his hand, giving it a
vigorous, Young Republican shake.
                           PARKER
             I'm Drew MacLeod.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Ms. MacLeod, I hope this is
             interesting.

The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling
across campus with Drew clinging for life to his
handlebars.
Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the
brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the
puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.
                           JIM
             You okay?
The old Drew is back.     She scrambles out of the
shrub...
                           DREW
             Fine.
... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.
                            DREW
             Wait right there.
                     (beat)
             I mean, I don't want to be bossy.
             You don't have to stay right
             there, if you don't want to.
                           JIM
             I'll be right here.
                           DREW
             Great.
She launches herself into the building.

INT. PROFESSOR SPAULDING'S OFFICE - DAY
Parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed
just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap.

                      (primly)
             I promise you, though my missing
             the deadline seems to suggest
             otherwise, my studies would never
             suffer on account of my being
             unorganized. This was, and I
             think anyone who knows me would
             vouch for this, a complete
             anomaly.

             I was so thrown when my sister
             asked Bernard to the dance that I
             simply failed to post the schedule
             request and seeing it already
             checked off on my to-do list, I
             over-looked it until after the
             deadline had passed.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Ms. MacLeod, I recall your
             application being one of the
             strongest we received. Not seeing
             your name on the interview list
             surprised me. I assumed, of
             course, that you'd changed your
             mind.
                           PARKER
             No. Not at all. This program is
             my number one priority.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Yes, well, I'm sure you can
             appreciate that with so many
             applicants for so few spaces there
             must be rules to govern the
             selection process.
A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly
the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN:
                           DREW
             Professor Spaulding? I can't
             apologize enough for barging in
             like this.
The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but
by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             No. Please. It looks like I'm
             taking the red-eye now anyway.
Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a
face full of Parker, already there.
                           DREW

             Oh, the Professor and I have had a
             wonderful talk about how important
             this program is to me and how it
             was my sister, Drew, who screwed
             things up.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             I'm having a little trouble
             following this.
                           DREW

Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip
trembles.

             Parker, consider, just for a
             moment, whether this is the
             appropriate time and place.
                           PARKER
             Okay, I considered.     What I want
             to say is, I didn't    purposefully
             set out to ruin your    day, but that
             doesn't mean I'm not    a little...
             jealous.
                             DREW
             Jealous?
                           PARKER
             I'm not like you. I don't have
             your intensity, your focus, your...
                             PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Fashion sense?
                            PARKER
             I just mean, maybe, even if I
             don't intend to, maybe that
             jealousy, you know, gets in the
             way sometimes.
                           DREW
             You mean subliminally you're
             undermining me?
                           PARKER
             I don't know if I'd get that
             technical about it. But yeah.
                           DREW
             Well, thank you for saying that.
                            PARKER
             You're welcome.
                     (beat)
             Aren't you going to confess now?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

             Confess what?
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             There's got to be something. Like
             how you lost your shoes?
                           PARKER
             How you're secretly jealous of me?
                           DREW
             Why would I be jealous of you?
                           PARKER
             Oh, let me see. Because I don't
             have a stick up my butt? Because
             I know how to have fun? Because
             I'm spontaneous and creative and
             men are all my love slaves?
Drew stops, ponders this deeply.
                             DREW
             Nope.
Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.
                           DREW
             Well, maybe about the love slaves.
This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters
share a smile. Drew turns to the Professor.
                           DREW
             Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Are you certain?
                           DREW
             I wanted more than anything in the
             world to be a part of your
             program. I still do. But I
             failed. I didn't follow the
             rules. And honestly, before
             today, I didn't know how I was
             going to live with that. How to
             live with failure. I'm not good
             at it. I haven't done it much.
             But today I realized that I've
             lived in fear of it too long.

             I hope my application was a strong
             one and I came here today to ask
             your indulgence and to place my
             name back into consideration. If
             you won't, I'll understand.
             Better yet, I'll get over it.
             Maybe I shouldn't be in such a
             hurry after all. Maybe it would
             be best for me to just take
             this...
Drew takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the
wastebasket.
                           DREW
             ... and lighten up.
Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in
the trash and fishes it out.
                           DREW
             Thanks for your time. Sorry if
             you missed your plane.
He shakes her hand.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             It was worth it, I assure you.
             Now, could you clear up one thing
             for me?
                           DREW/PARKER
             Sure.

             What's this about jail?

Warren and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out,
smiling.
Drew turns to Parker.

             Yeah?
                              PARKER
             Gotta go.
Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the
corner just as...
Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on,
half off the curb.
He leans over, waving to Drew.
                              CHARLEY
             Hi, baby!
Drew goes over to the truck.
                           CHARLEY
             I was in the city. I tried to
             call you. Thought you might want
             a ride home.
                              DREW
             Sure.

             First I want to take a shower.
             For about a week.
Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek.         Then she
reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.
                            DREW
             Call me, okay?
                           JIM
             You have a card? Aren't you in
             high school?
She smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. They
pull away, leaving Jim waving. When they're out of
sight, Parker and Warren come back around the corner of
the building.
                           PARKER
             Oh, man. I'm doomed.     I'll never
             get home before them.
                            WARREN
             Sure you will.
Warren pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.
                             WARREN
             Dad?   Hey.   I need a favor.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
Passing over the City, Warren and Parker are strapped in,
headphones on, and have to talk above the DIN.
                           PARKER
             Warren, something tells me you're
             spoiled!

Both girls are putting on makeup, getting ready to go
out. Everything appears the same as before, Drew's side
neat and clean, Parker's a wreck.

Quinn steps in, grimfaced.
                           QUINN
             How naive do you think I am?
The Girls share a look.       Busted.
                           PARKER
             We, uh, don't think you're naive,
             Mom.
                          DREW
             No. Honestly, it was all an
             accident.
Quinn holds out her hand revealing a BELLY RING.
                           QUINN
             I know what this is.
There's almost a palpable sense of relief between the
girls. They BOTH LOOK DOWN and pull up their shirts --
Parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced --
Drew does, too.
                           QUINN
             Parker, I'm disappointed you'd do
             something like this without
             consulting me, but Drew? What got
             into you? Do you know how
             unhygienic those places are?
                           DREW
             It was... spontaneous.
                          QUINN
             Yeah. Obviously. Oh, by the
             way...
She holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.
                           QUINN
             This came in the mail.
They stare at the envelope -- NYU ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT.
                              PARKER
             So?   Open it.
There's a HONK.

             Come on!
                           DREW
             It doesn't really matter one way
             or the other. Maybe I shouldn't
             be in such a hurry. Why don't we
             go out and have some fun.
             Besides, if this isn't good news,
             I don't want it to ruin our night.
Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare.

INT. MacLEOD LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Charley's laying on the couch with some chips on his
stomach watching the game.
Jim and Warren are watching, too.
                           CHARLEY
             So, how'd you two meet the girls?
Jim and Warren share a look.        This is a story best left
untold.

             Dance class, huh? Stupid    me. I
             figured it had to be that   day in
             New York when Parker blew   off her
             chem test and Drew was in   jail.
Charley smiles.       He's not as out of it as he appears.
Suddenly, all three women SCREAM JOYFULLY O.S.

"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"


 

			 "O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"

					  By

			   Ethan Coen and Joel Coen

	BLACK

	In black, we hear a chain-gang chant, many voices together, 
	spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock. A 
	title burns in:

	O muse! 
	Sing in me, and through me tell the story 
	Of that man skilled in all the ways of contending... 
	A wanderer, harried for years on end...

	On the sound of an impact we cut to:

	A PICK

	splitting a rock.

	As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at 
	work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, 
	chained together, working under a brutal midday sun.

	It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road 
	stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
	patrol the line.

	The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.

	We slowly fade out, returning to

	BLACK

	The last of the voices fades.

	After a long beat we hear the guitar introduction to Harry 
	McClintock's 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain.'

	A WHEAT FIELD

	A road cuts across the middle background. Noonday sun beats 
	down.

	We hear the distant picks and shovels of men at work and 
	see, rising above ground level, the occasional upraised pick 
	and spade heaving dirt. Men are digging a ditch alongside 
	the road.

	After a long beat, three men pop up in the wheat field in 
	the middle foreground. They wear faded stripes and grey duck-
	billed caps. They scurry abreast toward the camera, throwing 
	an occasional glance back at the ditch-diggers. A clanking 
	sound accompanies their run. Oddly, the wheat between them 
	sweeps down as they run. After a brief sprint they drop back 
	down into the wheat.

	In the background a man enters frame left, strolling along 
	the road, wearing a khaki uniform and sunglasses, a shotgun 
	resting against one shoulder. He glances idly down into the 
	ditch and strolls on out of frame right.

	The three men rise back up from the wheat and, clanking, 
	resume their sprint.

	THREE PAIRS OF EYES

	They are topped by three cap bills, and peer out from behind 
	a blind of greenery. We hear distant whistling.

	The men are looking at a weathered barn. A young boy, 
	whistling, is heading down the road that leads away from the 
	barn, jiggling the traces of the old plough horse that leads 
	him. He turns a corner and is gone.

	BARNYARD

	The three clanking men (we can now see their leg irons) are 
	awkwardly chasing a chicken around the yard. The squawking 
	yardbird doesn't need to move much to elude the three bunched 
	men.

	COUNTRY LANE

	It curves in a gentle S into the background. It is sun-
	dappled, pretty.

	We hear clanking footsteps approaching at a trot.

	The three men enter in the foreground and trot on down the 
	lane. The leftmost has a flapping chicken tucked under one 
	arm.

	AFTERNOON CAMPFIRE

	The three men sit in a side-by-side arc around a dying fire, 
	one of them contentedly picking his teeth with a small chicken 
	bone, another wiping grease off his chin with a sleeve, the 
	third idly poking at the fire with a spit.

	Each of them, still bound by chains, clinks as he moves.

	One of them abruptly cocks his head, listening.

	The others notice his attitude and also freeze, listening.

	We hear the distant baying of hounds.

	ROLLING HILLS

	From high on a ridge we see the three chained men running 
	toward us.

	In addition to their clanks we hear a distant chugging sound.

	TRACKING

	Laterally with the clanking, running feet.

	The chugging sound is very loud.

	RUNNING

	Next to a freight train. A boxcar door is open.

	INSIDE THE BOXCAR

	The lead convict hooks an elbow in and starts hauling himself 
	up, his two clanking friends keeping pace outside.

	Six hobos sit in the boxcar, lounging against sacks of 
	O'Daniel's Flour. They impassively watch the convict clamber 
	in as his two confederates run to keep up.

	The convict hauls himself to his feet. In spite of his stubble 
	he has carefully tended hair and a pencil mustache. He is 
	Everett.

	As he dusts himself off:

				EVERETT
		Say, uh, any a you boys smithies?

	The hobos stare.

	Everett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second 
	convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third 
	convict still keeping pace outside.

				EVERETT
		Or, if not smithies per se, were you 
		otherwise trained in the metallurgic 
		arts before straitened circumstances 
		forced you into a life of aimless 
		wanderin'?

	The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and 
	disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately 
	after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in 
	turn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the 
	open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves 
	on the boxcar floorboards.

	The hobos impassively watch.

	OUTSIDE

	The three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment.

	Squush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom.

	They shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the 
	muck and watch the train recede.

	Its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds.

				EVERETT
		Jesus - can't I count on you people?

	The second con is Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Sorry, Everett.

	Everett looks desperately about.

				EVERETT
		All right - if we take off through 
		that bayou-

	The third con, Pete, bald but also with beard stubble, angrily 
	cuts in.

				PETE
		Wait a minute! Who elected you leader 
		a this outfit?

				EVERETT
		Well, Pete, I just figured it should 
		be the one with capacity for abstract 
		thought. But if that ain't the 
		consensus view, hell, let's put her 
		to a vote!

				PETE
		Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!

				EVERETT
		Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!

	Both men look interrogatively to Delmar.

	He looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably.

				DELMAR
		Okay - I'm with you fellas.

	Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen.

	The baying of hounds is louder now, but through it we hear a 
	distant scrape of metal against metal, like the workings of 
	a rusty pump. The men turn in unison to look up the track.

	A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward 
	them.

	As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. 
	An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw 
	handle.

	The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to 
	show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs.

	The flatcar draws even and slows.

				EVERETT
		Mind if we join you, ol' timer?

				OLD MAN
		Join me, my sons.

	The three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping.

	The three men exchange glances; Delmar waves a clanking hand 
	before the old man's milky eyes. No reaction.

				DELMAR
		You work for the railroad, grandpa?

				OLD MAN
		I work for no man.

				PETE
		Got a name, do ya?

				OLD MAN
		I have no name.

				EVERETT
		Well, that right there may be why 
		you've had difficulty finding gainful 
		employment. Ya see, in the mart of 
		competitive commerce, the-

				OLD MAN
		You seek a great fortune, you three 
		who are now in chains...

	The men fall silent.

				OLD MAN
		And you will find a fortune - though 
		it will not be the fortune you seek...

	The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the 
	blind prophet.

				OLD MAN
		...But first, first you must travel 
		a long and difficult road - a road 
		fraught with peril, uh-huh, and 
		pregnant with adventure. You shall 
		see things wonderful to tell. You 
		shall see a cow on the roof of a 
		cottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many 
		startlements...

	The cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the 
	track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame.

				OLD MAN
		...I cannot say how long this road 
		shall be. But fear not the obstacles 
		in your path, for Fate has vouchsafed 
		your reward.  And though the road 
		may wind, and yea, your hearts grow 
		weary, still shall ye foller the 
		way, even unto your salvation.

	The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate 
	his words.

	Loud and sudden:

				OLD MAN
		IZZAT CLEAR?

	The men start, then mumble polite acknowledgement.

	The railroad tracks wind to the setting sun. Reek-a reek-a 
	reek-a - the flatcar rolls, in wide shot, toward the golden 
	horizon.

								FADE OUT

	DAY

	A hot dusty road leading up to a lone farmhouse.

	The three men walk, clanking and abreast.

				DELMAR
		How'd he know about the treasure?

				EVERETT
		Don't know, Delmar-though the blind 
		are reputed to possess sensitivities 
		compensatin' for their lack of sight, 
		even to the point of developing para-
		normal psychic powers. Now clearly, 
		seein' the future would fall neatly 
		into that ka-taggery. It's not so 
		surprising, then, if an organism 
		deprived of earthly vision-

				PETE
		He said we wouldn't get it! He said 
		we wouldn't get the treasure we seek!

	Everett grows testy:

				EVERETT
		Well what does he know - he's an 
		ignorant old man! Jesus, Pete, I'm 
		telling you I buried it myself, and 
		if your cousin still runs this-here 
		horse farm and has a forge and some 
		shoein' impediments to restore our 
		liberty of movement-

	Bang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men.

				CHILD'S VOICE
		Hold it rah chair!

	The front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front 
	porch and a dark screen door.

	The screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the 
	porch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost 
	bigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years 
	old, wears tattered overalls.

				CHILD
		You men from the bank?

				PETE
		You Wash's boy?

				CHILD
		Yassir! And Daddy tolt me I'm to 
		shoot whosoever from the bank!

	He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands.

				DELMAR
		Well, we ain't from no bank, young 
		feller.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I'm also suppose to shoot 
		folks servin' papers!

				DELMAR
		Well we ain't got no papers.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I nicked the census man!

				DELMAR
		There's a good boy. Is your daddy 
		about?

	THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

	Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted 
	bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm 
	implements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly 
	at a stick.

	He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, 
	then returns to his whittling.

				WASH
		'Lo, Pete. Hooor yer friends?

				EVERETT
		Pleased to make your acquaintance, 
		Mister Hogwallop. M'name's Ulysses 
		Everett McGill.

				DELMAR
		'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.

				PETE
		How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, 
		thirteen year'n?

	Still looking sourly at his whittling:

				WASH
		You've grown chatty.

	He tosses the stick aside and sighs.

				WASH
		I expect you'll want them chains 
		knocked off.

	THE HOGWALLOP KITCHEN

	The four men and little boy sit around the kitchen table 
	eating stew. A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair 
	brings him to table height. The cons are now rid of their 
	chains and are dressed in ill-fitting farmer's wear.

	WASH

	They foreclosed on Cousin Vester. He hanged himself a year 
	come May.

				PETE
		And Uncle Ratliff?

				WASH
		The anthrax took most of his cows. 
		The rest don't milk, and he lost a 
		boy to mumps.

				PETE
		Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

	Wash glances at the little boy.

				WASH
		Couldn't say. Mrs. Hogwallop up and 
		R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

				EVERETT
		Mm. Must've been lookin' for answers.

				WASH
		Possibly. Good riddance, far as I'm 
		concerned...

	The three men slurp their stew.

				WASH
		I do miss her cookin' though.

				DELMAR
		This stew's awful good.

				WASH
		Think so?

	He sniffs dubiously at his spoon.

				WASH
		I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday; 
		'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

	LIVING ROOM

	Later. The four men sit about listening to a big box radio. 
	Wash is whittling once again; Everett dips his comb into a 
	pomade jar and carefully works on his hair; Pete is digging 
	around with a toothpick; Delmar dreamily waves one hand in 
	time to the music.

	The music ends.

				ANNOUNCER
		Well, that's the last number for 
		tonight's 'Pass the Biscuits Pappy 
		O'Daniel Flour Hour.' This is Pappy 
		O'Daniel, hopin' you folks been 
		enjoyin' that good old-timey music, 
		and remember, when you're fixin' to 
		fry up some flapjacks or bake a mess 
		a biscuits, use cool clear water and 
		good pure Pappy O'Daniel flour for 
		that 'Pass the Biscuits, Pappy' 
		flavor.  So tune in next week folks, 
		and till then whyncha turn to your 
		better half and sing along with Pappy: 
		'You are my sunshine, my only 
		sunshine...'

	Everett clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Well, guess I'll be turning in...

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

				EVERETT
		Say, Cousin Wash, I guess it'd be 
		the acme of foolishness to inquire 
		if you had a hairnet.

				WASH
		Got a bunch in yon byurra.  Mrs. 
		Hogwallop's, matter of fact.  
		Hepyaseff; I won't be needin' 'em.

	THE THREE MEN

	Sleeping in a hayloft. Everett wears a hairnet over his 
	painstakingly arranged hair.

	Pete snores on the inhale. Delmar whistles on the exhale.

	A spotlight plays over the hayloft ceiling and a voice booms:

				BULLHORN VOICE
		All right boys, itsy authorities.

	The three men rouse themselves.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		We gotcha surrounded. Just come on 
		out grabbin' air!

	Everett shrugs his shoulders and peeks down into the barnyard.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	From high we see a foreshortened lawman holding a bullhorn 
	surrounded by armed deputies.

	Next to the man with the bullhorn, a tin-starred sheriff 
	watches impassively through mirrored sunglasses, a bloodhound 
	drooling at his side.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		And don't try nothin' fancy - your 
		sitchy-ation is purt nigh hopeless.

				DELMAR
		What inna Sam Hill...?

				EVERETT
		Pete's cousin turned us in for the 
		bounty!

				PETE
		The hell you say! Wash is kin!

	An unamplified voice echoes up from the yard:

				VOICE
		Sorry Pete! I know we're kin! But 
		they got this Depression on, and I 
		gotta do fer me and mine!

	Pete screams down from the hayport:

				PETE
		I'M GONNA KILL YOU, JUDAS ISCARIOT 
		HOGWALLOP! YOU MIS'ABLE HOSS-EATIN' 
		SONOFABITCH! YOU-

	RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT- Everett pulls Pete down as a tommy gun spits 
	lead into the hayloft.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	Pete is enraged:

				PETE
		Damn his eyes! Pa always said never 
		trust a Hogwallop-COME'N GET US, 
		COPPERS!

				BULLHORN VOICE
		So be it! You boys're leavin' us no 
		choice but to smoke you out.

				EVERETT
		Oh no! Lord have mercy!

	Men approach the barn with torches.

				DELMAR
		What do we do now, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Fire! I hate fire!

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY TIN-WEARIN' MOTHERLESS
		BARNBURNIN' COCKROACHES-

	Everett cuts in, his voice breaking:

				EVERETT
		NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD 
		OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK 
		THIS THING OUT!

				DELMAR
		Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

	The hayloft is filling with smoke. Flames lick downstairs.

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN 
		SKUNKS-

				EVERETT
		Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak 
		with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH 
		THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!

	Pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized 
	congregation.

	It lands harmlessly in some scattered straw.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		You choose it, boys - the prison 
		farm or the pearly gates!

	The straw curls, lights, and the fire scuttles over to a 
	parked Black Maria.

	With a loud airy WHOOOF! the undercarriage of the police van 
	pops into flame.

	The man with the bullhorn sees it.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Holy Saint Christopher - OUTA THAT 
		VEHICLE, CHAMP, SHE'S LICKIN' FAR!

	Tommy guns are stored in the back of the van. The drum of 
	one starts spinning.

	Flames lick up the outside of the van as - chinka-chinka-
	chinka - bullet holes walk across the body.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Take cover, boys, THAT AIN'T POPCORN!

	Yelling men scurry away.

	The vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many 
	tommy guns now firing inside. Tires pop, hiss and settle; 
	doors pop open; glass shatters.

				VOICES
		Who's that?

	An oncoming car is bouncing crazily across the yard, horn 
	blaring. Deputies leap out of its path.

	The car shoots past the chattering van which still bucks and 
	bounces on its shocks, its interior strobing and flashing as 
	if filled with trapped lightning.

	The speeding car heads directly for the flaming barn door 
	and crashes through in a shower of sparks.

	The car brakes inside the barn and the driver's door flies 
	open. The little Hogwallop boy yells over the roar of the 
	flames:

				BOY
		Come on, boys! I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-
		T!

	Pete, Everett and Delmar pile in.

				DELMAR
		You should be in bed, little fella.

	The doors slam shut and the boy grinds into gear. He has 
	wood blocks strapped to his feet so that he can reach 
	accelerator, brake and clutch. He sits on a Sears Roebuck 
	catalogue to give him a view over the dash.

				BOY
		You ain't the boss a me!

	The car speeds for the far wall, sheeted in flame, and bursts 
	through.

	COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	The little Hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the 
	middle of the empty road. His walk is unsteady, the wood 
	blocks still strapped to his feet.

	He turns to face us and hollers:

				BOY
		You candy-butted car-thievin' so's 
		'n so's! I curse yer names!

	Pete enters in the foreground and throws a dirt clod at the 
	boy. It lands shy as Pete yells:

				PETE
		Go back home'n mind yer pa!

	We pan Pete over to the shoulder where the car is stopped, 
	its hood propped open. Everett and Delmar are looking at the 
	engine.

				PETE
		What's the damn problem?

	DRYGOODS STORE

	The proprietor is a bespectacled middle-aged man wearing 
	sleeve garters and a visor. Behind him are stacked, among 
	other necessaries, sacks of O'Daniel Flour. He pushes a small 
	tin across the counter.

				PROPRIETOR
		I can get the part from Bristol; 
		it'll take two weeks. Here's your 
		pomade.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		Two weeks! That don't do me no good!

				PROPRIETOR
		Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

	Everett picks up the tin.

				EVERETT
		Hold on there - I don't want this 
		pomade, I want Dapper Dan.

				PROPRIETOR
		I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry 
		Fop.

				EVERETT
		No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I 
		use Dapper Dan!

				PROPRIETOR
		Watch your language, young fellow, 
		this is a public market. Now, if you 
		want Dapper Dan I can order it for 
		you, have it in a couple of weeks.

				EVERETT
		Well, ain't this place a geographical 
		oddity-two weeks from everywhere!  
		Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!

	PETE AND DELMAR

	On a wooded hillside. They sit at a twig fire, roasting a 
	small creature on a spit.

				EVERETT (O.S.)
		It didn't look like a one-horse 
		town...

	He stalks into frame and plops disgustedly down by the fire.

				EVERETT
		...but try getting a decent hair 
		jelly.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

				EVERETT
		And no transmission belt for two 
		weeks neither.

				PETE
		Huh?! They dam that river on the 
		21st.  Today's the 17th!

				EVERETT
		Don't I know it.

				PETE
		We got but four days to get to that 
		treasure! After that, it'll be at 
		the bottom of a lake!

	He grimly shakes his head.

				PETE
		We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

	Everett has taken out a can of near-empty Dapper Dan. He 
	scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his 
	hair.

	We hear distant singing - one lone tenor voice.

				EVERETT
		Well, you're right there, but the 
		ol' tactician's already got a plan-

	Everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to 
	Pete.

				EVERETT
		-for the transportation, that is; I 
		don't know how I'm gonna keep my 
		coiffure in order.

	Pete looks at the watch, puzzled.

				PETE
		How's this a plan? How're we gonna 
		get a car?

				EVERETT
		Sell that. I figured it could only 
		have painful associations for Wash.

	Pete pops the front and reads the inscription.

				PETE
		To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop.  
		From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie-
		dellis.

				EVERETT
		It was in his bureau.

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

	Delmar whistles appreciatively.

				DELMAR
		You got light fingers, Everett. 
		Gopher?

				PETE
		You mis'able little sneak thief...

	He lurches threateningly to his feet.

				PETE
		You stole from my kin!

	Everett scrambles up.

				EVERETT
		Who was fixing to betray us!

				PETE
		You didn't know that at the time!

				EVERETT
		So I borrowed it till I did know!

				PETE
		That don't make no sense!

				EVERETT
		Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in 
		the chambers of the human heart. 
		What the hell's that singing?

	We can make out the words now, sung by the lone tenor.

				VOICE
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you wanna go down...

	People in white robes are drifting down the hill, through 
	the woods behind the campsite. They join in with the lead 
	voice:

				VOICES
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, down to 
		the river to pray...

	Delmar gazes wonderingly at the white-robed figures as he 
	answers Everett:

				DELMAR
		Appears to be... some kinda... con-
		gur-gation. Care for some gopher?

	Everett too watches the white-robed people following in the 
	wake of the tenor. He answers absently:

				EVERETT
		No, thank you Delmar - a third of a 
		gopher would only rouse my appetite 
		without beddin' her back down.

	There are more and more white robes drifting through the 
	woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men.

				DELMAR
		You can have the whole thing - me'n 
		Pete already had one...

	There is an endless stream now, drifting through the 
	foreground, the background, the campsite itself.

				VOICES
		Oh, sisters, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you want to go down...

				DELMAR
		We ran acrost a gopher village...

	The drifting worshipers wear beatific expressions. One only, 
	a middle-aged woman, notices the three convicts around whom 
	the rest of the flock blindly drifts. She calls to them:

				WOMAN
		Come with us, brothers! Join us and 
		be saved!

	THE RIVER

	White robes stream down the hill, out of the woods, and down 
	the riverbank. The voices swell in a great chorus:

				VOICES
		We went down to the river one day, 
		Studying about that good old way, 
		And who shall wear that robe and 
		crown, Oh Lord, show us the way...

	We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground. 
	He stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man 
	back-down into the water. Behind him a line of robed singers 
	lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods.

	Pete, Delmar and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down 
	at the river. White-robed people continue to drift past them.

				EVERETT
		I guess hard times flush the chumps.  
		Everybody's lookin' for answers, and 
		there's always-

	Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line.

				EVERETT
		Where the hell's he goin'?

	Delmar has reached the minister and holds his nose as the 
	minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water.

				PETE
		Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's 
		been saved!

				EVERETT
		Pete, don't be ignorant-

	Delmar is slogging back through the water.

				DELMAR
		Well that's it boys, I been redeemed!  
		The preacher warshed away all my 
		sins and transgressions. It's the 
		straight-and-narrow from here on out 
		and heaven everlasting's my reward!

				EVERETT
		Delmar what the hell are you talking 
		about? - We got bigger fish to fry-

				DELMAR
		Preacher said my sins are warshed 
		away, including that Piggly Wiggly I 
		knocked over in Yazoo!

				EVERETT
		I thought you said you were innocent 
		a those charges.

				DELMAR
		Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to 
		say that that sin's been warshed 
		away too!  Neither God nor man's got 
		nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, 
		the water's fine!

	LATER

	The smoldering twig fire. A bloodhound on a leash circles 
	into frame, its tail fiercely wagging.

	We follow it as, nose to the ground and straining against 
	its leash, it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan 
	pomade.

				A VOICE
		All tight, boys! We got the scent!

	A CAR

	Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile. 
	Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both 
	dripping wet.

	Pete is sullen:

				PETE
		The preacher said it absolved us.

				EVERETT
		For him, not for the law! I'm 
		surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave 
		you credit for more brains than 
		Delmar.

				DELMAR
		But there were witnesses, saw us 
		redeemed!

				EVERETT
		That's not the issue, Delmar. Even 
		if it did put you square with the 
		Lord, the State of Mississippi is 
		more hardnosed.

				DELMAR
		You should a joined us, Everett. It 
		couldn't a hurt none.

				PETE
		Hell, at least it woulda washed away 
		the stink of that pomade.

				EVERETT
		Join you two ignorant fools in a 
		ridiculous superstition? Thank you 
		anyway.  And I like the smell of my 
		hair treatment - the pleasing odor 
		is half the point.

	He shakes his head and laughs.

				EVERETT
		Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a 
		bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're 
		my cross to bear-

				DELMAR
		Pull over, Everett - let's give that 
		colored boy a lift.

	A thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands 
	on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. He 
	grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and 
	trots up to the open window.

				HITCHHIKER
		You folks goin' through Tishamingo?

	Delmar pushes open the back door.

				DELMAR
		Sure, hop in.

	Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls 
	out.

				EVERETT
		How ya doin', boy? Name's Everett, 
		and these two soggy sonsabitches are 
		Pete and Delmar. Keep your fingers 
		away from Pete's mouth-he ain't had 
		nothin' to eat for the last thirteen 
		years but prison food, gopher, and a 
		little greasy horse.

				HITCHHIKER
		Thank you fuh the lif', suh. M'names 
		Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

	Delmar is genuinely friendly:

				DELMAR
		How ya doin', Tommy. I haven't seen 
		a house in miles. What're you doin' 
		out in the middle of nowhere?

	Tommy is matter-of-fact:

				TOMMY
		I had to be at that crossroads las' 
		midnight to sell mah soul to the 
		devil.

				EVERETT
		Well ain't it a small world, 
		spiritually speakin'! Pete and Delmar 
		just been baptized and saved! I guess 
		I'm the only one here who remains 
		unaffiliated!

				DELMAR
		This ain't no laughin' matter, 
		Everett.

				EVERETT
		What'd the devil give you for your 
		soul, Tommy?

				TOMMY
		He taught me to play this guitar 
		real good.

	Delmar is horrified:

				DELMAR
		Oh, son! For that you traded your 
		everlastin' soul?!

	Tommy shrugs.

				TOMMY
		I wudden usin' it.

				PETE
		I always wondered-what's the devil 
		look like?

				EVERETT
		Well, of course there's all manner 
		of lesser imps'n demons, Pete, but 
		the Great Satan hisself is red and 
		scaly with a bifurcated tail and 
		carries a hayfork.

				TOMMY
		Oh no! No suh! He's white-white as 
		you folks, with mirrors for eyes an'  
		a big hollow voice an' allus travels 
		with a mean old hound.

				PETE
		And he told you to go to Tishamingo?

				TOMMY
		No suh, that was mah idea. I heard 
		they's a man there pays folks money 
		to sing into a can. They say he pays 
		extra effen you play real good.

	Everett's eyes narrow as he studies the man in the rearview.

				EVERETT
		How much does he pay?

	TISHAMINGO

	The car is pulling into the parking lot of a single-story 
	cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a 
	handpainted sign:

	WEZY 
	LISTENING AIN'T NEVER BEEN 
	SO EASY NOR 
	SO FINE

	As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders.

				EVERETT
		All right boys, just follow my lead.

	INSIDE

	Everett strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears 
	dark glasses and holds a white cane.

				EVERETT
		Who's the honcho around here?

				MAN
		I am. Hur you?

				EVERETT
		Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers 
		and these here are the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi-
		Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. 
		We hear you pay good money to sing 
		into a can.

				MAN
		Well that all depends. You boys do 
		Negro songs?

	Everett grimaces, thinking.

				EVERETT
		Sir, we are Negroes. All except our 
		a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, 
		the fella that plays the gui-tar.

				MAN
		Well, I don't record Negro songs. 
		I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey 
		material.  Why, people just can't 
		get enough of it since we started 
		broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel 
		Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' 
		by, but-

				EVERETT
		Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been 
		steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, 
		you're silly with it, aintcha boys?

				PETE
		That's right!

				DELMAR
		That's right! We ain't really Negroes!

				PETE
		All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!

	THE STUDIO

	The three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, 
	who plays his guitar into a can microphone. They are 
	performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant 
	Sorrow'.

	When they finish Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back.

				EVERETT
		Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you 
		did sell your soul to the devil!

				MAN
		Boys, that was some mighty fine 
		pickin' and singin'. You just sign 
		these papers and I'll give you ten 
		dollars apiece.

				EVERETT
		Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll 
		have to scratch Xes - only four of 
		us can write.

	THE LOT

	A caravan of two oversize cars is pulling into the lot just 
	as Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station 
	door, whooping it up.

	A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by 
	suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly is 
	getting out of the first car. His face is familiar from 
	countless sacks of Pass the Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour.

	Delmar waves a fistful of money at him.

				DELMAR
		Hey mister! I don't mean to be tellin' 
		tales out a school, but there's a 
		man in there hands out ten dollars 
		to anyone sings into his can!

				PAPPY
		I'm not here to make a record, ya 
		dumb cracker, they broadcast me out 
		on the radio.

	A big shambling man of about thirty has followed him out of 
	the car. He has the sloping shoulders, the pasty skin, and 
	the aimlessly bobbing head of an intellectual flyweight.

				JUNIOR
		That's Governor Menelaus 'Pass the 
		Biscuits, Pappy' O'Daniel, and he'd 
		sure 'preciate it if you ate his 
		farina and voted him a second term.

	Two other members of the retinue, older men whose girth rivals 
	the governor's, are Eckard and Spivey.

				ECKARD
		Finest governor we've ever had in 
		M'sippi.

				SPIVEY
		In any state.

				ECKARD
		Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; 
		I was makin' the larger point.

	As Pappy brushes by them, Junior wheedles:

				JUNIOR
		Aintcha gonna press the flesh, Pappy, 
		do a little politickin'?

	Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'll press your flesh, you dimwitted 
		sonofabitch - you don't tell your 
		pappy how to cawt the elect 'rate!

	Pappy waves his hat at the radio building as singers in faux 
	hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get 
	out of the second car.

				PAPPY
		We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we 
		mass communicatin'!

				ECKARD
		Oh, yes, assa parful new force.

				SPIVEY
		Mm-mm.

	The men head for the station, with Junior lagging.

				PAPPY
		Shake a leg, Junior! Thank God your 
		mama died givin' birth-if she'd a 
		seen ya she'd a died of shame...

	A CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	Tommy sits in the background, playing and singing a slow 
	blues. The three convicts, holding coffee cups, gaze into 
	the fire.

	Over the dreamy song:

				DELMAR
		Why don't we bed down out here 
		tonight?

				PETE
		Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

				EVERETT
		Suits me...

	He stretches out.

				EVERETT
		Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but 
		feather beds'n silk sheets.

	Pete swishes his coffee as he stares into the blaze.

				PETE
		A million dollars.

				EVERETT
		Million point two.

				DELMAR
		Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

				EVERETT
		Four hundred, Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Izzat right?

				EVERETT
		What're you gonna do with your share 
		of the treasure, Pete?

				PETE
		Go out west somewhere, open a fine 
		restaurant. I'm gonna be the maider 
		dee.  Greet all the swells, go to 
		work ever' day in a bowtie and tuxedo, 
		an' all the staff'll all say Yassir 
		and Nawsir and in a Jiffy Pete...

	He gives his coffee a thoughtful swish and murmurs:

				PETE
		An' all my meals for free...

				EVERETT
		What about you, Delmar? What're you 
		gonna do with your share a that dough?

				DELMAR
		Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns 
		down at the Indianola Savings and 
		Loan and slap that cash down on the 
		barrelhead and buy back the family 
		farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man 
		if you ain't got land.

				PETE
		What about you, Everett? What'd you 
		have in mind when you stoled it in 
		the first place?

				EVERETT
		Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still 
		don't, really.

				PETE
		Well that hardly sounds like you...

	A distant Voice:

				VOICE
		All right, boys, itsy authorities!

	The three men tense up. Tommy stops singing.

				VOICE
		Your sitchy-ation is purt nigh 
		hopeless!

	Pete shovels dirt onto the fire as Delmar and Everett scramble 
	to peek over a low ridge.

	Their point-of-view shows a lone barn with their car parked 
	to one side. Various police vehicles have pulled up facing 
	the barn, and armed men, their backs to us, train guns on 
	it, some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars.

				EVERETT
		Damn! They found our car!

	The man with the bullhorn continues, directing his comments 
	at the distant barn:

				MAN
		We ain't got the time-and nary 
		inclination-to gentle you boys no 
		further!

	The three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands 
	impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a 
	leash against which a bloodhound strains.

				MAN
		It's either the penal farm or the 
		fires of damnation-makes no nevermind 
		to me!

	The sheriff makes a signal to a man holding a torch, who 
	skitters up to the barn and lights it.

				DELMAR
		Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

				EVERETT
		I left my pomade in that car! Maybe 
		I can creep up!

				DELMAR
		Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R-
		U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!

				EVERETT
		Where's Tommy?

				PETE
		Already lit out, scared out of his 
		wits. Let's go!

	DAYTIME ROAD

	The three men shuffle down the dusty road.

				PETE
		The hell it ain't square one! Ain't 
		no one gonna pick up three filthy 
		unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em 
		a know-it-all that can't keep his 
		trap shut!

				EVERETT
		Pete, the personal rancor reflected 
		in that remark I don't intend to 
		dignify with comment, but I would 
		like to address your general attitude 
		of hopeless negativism. Consider the 
		lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- 
		take a look at Delmar here as your 
		paradigm a hope.

				DELMAR
		Yeah, look at me.

				EVERETT
		Now you may call it an unreasoning 
		optimism. You may call it obtuse. 
		But the plain fact is we still have... 
		close to... close to...

	He loses his drift as all three men turn, reacting to the 
	sound of an approaching speeding car.

				EVERETT
		...close to... three days... before 
		they dam that river...

	The car comes into view cornering on two wheels. It crashes 
	back onto all four and, as it speeds along, dollar bills 
	snap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the 
	three men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb. It screeches to 
	a halt.

	The driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike 
	face, leans over to call through the passenger window.

				DRIVER
		Is this the road to Itta Bena?

				PETE
		Uh... Itta Bena...

	Delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air and 
	looks at it wonderingly. He holds it stretched between two 
	hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an 
	appraising pop.

				EVERETT
		Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...

				PETE
		Isn't it, uh...

	Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at 
	the wafting currency, and yanks another fluttering bill out 
	of the air.

				EVERETT
		I'm thinkin' it's uh, you could take 
		this road to, uh...

	There is the sound of a distant siren.

	The driver, still patiently leaning over to hear out the two 
	brainwrackers, shoots a quick look in his rearview mirror.

				PETE
		...Nah, that ain't right... I'm 
		thinkin' of...

				EVERETT
		...I believe, unless I'm very much 
		mistaken - see, we've been away for 
		several years, uh...

	The driver pushes open the passenger door.

				DRIVER
		Hop on in while you give it a think.

	The three men climb in and the car squeals out.

	INT. CAR

	The driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the 
	sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat.

				DRIVER
		Any a you boys know your way around 
		a Walther PPK?

				DELMAR
		Well now, that's where we cain't 
		help ya. I don't believe it's in 
		Mississippi.

	The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his 
	passengers. Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering 
	inside the car:

				DELMAR
		Friend, some of your folding money 
		has come unstowed.

				DRIVER
		Just stuff it down that sack there. 
		You boys aren't badmen, I take it?

				DELMAR
		Well, funny you should ask-I was 
		bad, till yesterday, but me'n Pete 
		here been saved. My name's Delmar, 
		and that there's Everett.

				DRIVER
		George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

	He opens his door and steps onto the running board, giving 
	Everett a casual:

				NELSON
		Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?

	Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully 
	outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped 
	on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other.

				NELSON
		Hand up that Thompson, Jack.

	Delmar gropes in the footwell.

				DELMAR
		Say, what line of work are you in, 
		George?

	EXT. CAR

	Nelson sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car.

				NELSON
		COME AND GET ME, COPPERS! YOU 
		FLATFOOTED LAMEBRAINED SOFT-ASSED 
		SONOFABITCHES! NO ONE CAN CATCH ME!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON! I'M BIGGER THAN 
		ANY JOHN LAW EVER LIVED! HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! I'M TEN-AND-A-HALF FEET TALL AND 
		AIN'T YET FULLY GROWED!

	Nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him, returning 
	fire. He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the 
	roadside and murmurs:

				NELSON
		...cows...

	He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop.

				NELSON
		I hate cows worse than coppers!

	He lets loose a spray. One of the cows drops and the rest 
	stampede toward the road.

				DELMAR
		Aww, George, not the livestock.

	Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing:

				NELSON
		HA-HA! COME ON YOU MISERABLE SALARIED 
		SONSABITCHES! COME AND GET ME!

	In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police 
	pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. 
	The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling 
	wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes.

	SMALL TOWN

	The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through 
	light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means 
	of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits.

	The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the 
	three convicts emerge to follow him.

				NELSON
		COME ON BOYS! WE'RE GOIN' FOR THE 
		RECORD-THREE BANKS IN TWO HOURS!

	Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through 
	the door of the bank, followed by the three men.

	He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table.

				NELSON
		OKAY FOLKS! HOLD THE APPLAUSE AND 
		DROP YER DRAWERS - I'M GEORGE NELSON 
		AND I'M HERE TO SACK THE CITY A ITTA 
		BENA!

	He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young 
	woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on 
	the lips.

	Delmar nudges Everett.

				DELMAR
		He's a live wire though, ain't he?

				NELSON
		Thanky dear! All the money in the 
		bag, and you can tell your grandkids 
		you were done by the best! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	He winks at the three men who obediently wait.

				NELSON
		It's a kick and a quarter, ain't it 
		boys?

	Distant sirens again.

				EVERETT
		Pardon me, George, but have you got 
		a plan for gettin' outa here?

				NELSON
		Sure boys, here's m'plan!

	He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of 
	dynamite.

				NELSON
		They ain't never seen ordnance like 
		this!  WELL, THANK YOU, FOLKS, AND 
		REMEMBER: JESUS SAVES, BUT GEORGE 
		NELSON WITHDRAWS!  HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! GO FETCH THE AUTO-VOITURE, PETE!

	He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as 
	customers murmur.

				VOICE
		...it's Babyface Nelson...

	George whirls.

				NELSON
		WHO SAID THAT?!

	The customers stare mutely back.

				NELSON
		WHAT IGNORANT LOWDOWN SLANDERIZING 
		SONOFABITCH SAID THAT?! MY NAME IS 
		GEORGE NELSON, GET ME?!

	The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably 
	about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to 
	steer him toward the door.

				DELMAR
		They didn't mean anything by it, 
		George.

				NELSON
		GEORGE NELSON! NOT BABYFACE! YOU 
		REMEMBER AND YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON, BORN TO RAISE 
		HELL!

	OUTSIDE THE BANK

	The siren grows louder as the four men emerge.

				EVERETT
		You gotta be a little tolerant, 
		George; all these poor folk know is 
		the legend.  Hell, they can't be 
		expected to appreciate the complex 
		individual underneath-  

				NELSON
		Aww, I'm all right-

	He shrugs off Everett's hand and lights the fuse on a stick 
	of dynamite.

				NELSON
		This'll put me right back on top!

	The car squeals up and, as sirens approach once again, the 
	three men pile in.

				NELSON
		OR-VOIR, ITTA BENA! GEORGE NELSON 
		THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

	As the car peels out - KA-BOOM! - the dynamite blows a crater 
	in the street behind.

	CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	George Nelson, now strangely quiet, holds a coffee cup and 
	stares gloomily into the fire.

	After a long beat, Delmar, also staring into the fire, slaps 
	one knee and ejaculates:

				DELMAR
		Damn but that was some fun though, 
		won it George?!

	George responds, barely audible and without brightening:

				GEORGE
		...yeah...

	Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. Delmar, however, 
	is less sensitive to the Babyface's mood.

				DELMAR
		Almost makes me wish I hadn't been 
		saved! Jackin' up banks - I can see 
		how a fella could derive a lot a 
		pleasure and satisfaction out of it!

				GEORGE
		...it's okay...

				DELMAR
		Whoa doggies!

	At length George swishes the coffee around his cup, shrugs, 
	tosses the coffee and rises.

				GEORGE
		...Well, I'm takin' off.

	He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded 
	Delmar.

				GEORGE
		You boys can have the automobile.

	Glassy-eyed, he continues to dig in his pockets and lets his 
	money fall to the ground.

				GEORGE
		'N might as well take my share a the 
		riches.

				DELMAR
		What the - where you goin', George?

	George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the 
	campfire's flickering circle of light.

				GEORGE
		...I dunno... who cares...

	Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's 
	retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money.

				DELMAR
		Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?

				EVERETT
		Well ya know, Delmar, they say that 
		with a thrill-seekin' personality, 
		what goes up must come down. Top of 
		the world one minute, haunted by 
		megrims the next. Yep, it's like our 
		friend George is a alley cat and his 
		own damn humors're swingin' him by 
		the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; 
		he'll be back on top again. I don't 
		think we've heard the last of George 
		Nelson.

	Delmar, gazing out at the blackness that has closed over 
	George Nelson, hasn't really been listening. He turns sadly 
	back.

				DELMAR
		Damn! I liked George.

	A FIELD

	A ploughing farmer has paused to look for the source of 
	distant string-band music, growing closer. There is also an 
	approaching amplified voice:

				VOICE
		Don't be saps for Pappy; vote for 
		Stokes and responsible gummint!

	A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the 
	field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the 
	candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed 
	of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he 
	pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if 
	conducting the music.

				VOICE
		He's against the Innarests and for 
		the little man!

	This, the driver's voice, is amplified through a flared 
	speaker mounted on the roof of the cab. As the oncoming truck 
	draws near, the midget bellows out at the farmer, who has 
	removed his hat to scratch his forehead.

				MIDGET
		Greetings, brother! Vote for Stokes!

	The voice tails away:

				MIDGET
		Clean gummint is yours for the askin'!

	Our pan with the passing truck comes to rest on the WEZY 
	radio building.

	INSIDE

	We are pulling back from a close shot of the portly blind 
	man.

				MAN
		Hang on! Lemme slap up a wire.

	He turns away to load a recording as he talks into a 
	microphone.

				MAN
		Folks, here's my cousin Ezzard's 
		niece Eudora from out Greenwood doin' 
		a little number with her cousin Tom-
		Tom which I predict you're just gonna 
		enjoy thoroughly.

	He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll 
	Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his 
	attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby.

				MAN
		Now what can I do you for, Mister 
		French?

				FRENCH
		How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys?

				MAN
		Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely 
		recollect, uh -

				FRENCH
		They cut a record in here, few days 
		ago, old-timey harmony thing with a 
		guitar Accump-accump-uh-

				MAN
		Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I 
		believe, swell bunch a boys, sung 
		into yon can and skedaddled.

				FRENCH
		Well that record has just gone through 
		the goddamn roof! They're playin' it 
		as far away as Mobile! The whole 
		damn state's goin' ape!

				MAN
		It was a powerful air.

				FRENCH
		Hot damn, we gotta find those boys!  
		Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's 
		bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the 
		goddamn competition will!

				MAN
		Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that 
		competition.

	'I'll Fly Away' mixes up to play full over the following.

	MONTAGE

	- The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun 
	shimmering off the rough pavement. Their bank loot, wrapped 
	in a bandanna, is knotted to the end of a stick slung over 
	Delmar's shoulder.

	- A different road under a threatening sky. The three men 
	stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two 
	little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of 
	ice. A horse-drawn cart rumbles in from offscreen and Everett 
	waggles his thumb. Thunder rumbles.

	- A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black 
	label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy 
	Bottom Boys.

	- A high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping 
	eave of a barn, under which Everett, Pete and Delmar have 
	taken cover. The three hold their coats pinched shut at the 
	neck as they look forlornly up at the weather.

	- The three men walk along a red dirt road elevated through 
	a bayou.

	- The three men sit around a campfire. Everett sits on a 
	stump, expressively telling a ghost story as Pete and Delmar 
	gaze at him from below, wide-eyed and rapt.

	- The three men walk past a cotton field dotted with burst 
	pods.

	- A Woolworth's interior. A sad-faced woman in a calico dress 
	addresses the clerk:

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys 
		performing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'?

				CLERK
		No, ma'am, we had a new shipment in 
		yesterday but we just can't keep it 
		on the shelves.

	The sad-faced woman is crestfallen.

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, mercy. Then - just the purple 
		toilet water.

	- The three men walk down a road excavated through banks of 
	clay, from which gnarled tree roots protrude.

	- A pie rests on a windowsill, steam wafting from it. A hand 
	enters from below the sill outside and disappears with the 
	pie. A moment later we see Everett's and Pete's backs as 
	they scamper away across the yard. A short beat, and then 
	Delmar peeks over the sill. He ducks back down and then his 
	hand reaches up to leave a dollar bill. Moments later we see 
	him scampering away after Pete and Everett.

	- Another campfire. The three men sit around it laughing as 
	they enjoy the pie, each with a slab on a plate improvised 
	of old newspaper. Everett finishes his piece, licks his thumb 
	and tosses the newspaper onto the fire.

	We jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins 
	to curl its edge. A story is headlined 'TVA Finalizing Plans 
	for Flooding of Arktabutta Valley'. The flame curls the page 
	away, briefly revealing the page beneath - with a story 
	headlined 'Soggy Bottom Boys a Sensation - But Who Are They?' - 
	before it too is consumed.

	- A little general store. We are very high, looking down at 
	a foreshortened Everett, Pete, Delmar and store clerk, who 
	is wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward 
	us. Everett is pointing up, directing the man with the pole. 
	He moves it tentatively to and fro until, at a certain point, 
	Everett nods vigorously.

	A reverse shows the end of the pole - a long stock-pincher - 
	as it closes over a tin of Dapper Dan pomade, resting on a 
	high shelf.

	The exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a 
	little crossroads town. The three men are emerging from the 
	store just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubble-topped 
	gas pumps out front. A fancyman in a boater hat gets out of 
	the car and heads for the store, passing the three; Everett 
	glances at him and, as the man disappears inside, he dives 
	into his car, waving for Delmar and Pete to follow. Delmar, 
	initially reluctant, is hauled into the car by Pete, and the 
	men take off.

	- The spinning 78 recording, as the song enters its last 
	verse.

	- A spinning car wheel.

	- A panoramic boom up as the car toodles away, down a road 
	that winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset.

	THE CAR

	The three men are driving through the heat of the day. Everett 
	drives; Pete is slouched in the front passenger seat; Delmar, 
	in back, picks out 'I'll Fly Away' on a banjo.

	Pete listens to something, squints, tilts his head.

				PETE
		...Shutup, Delmar.

	Delmar and Everett exchange glances; Everett shrugs and Delmar 
	desists.

	We can faintly hear a high, unearthly singing. Barely human, 
	the sound seems to agitate Pete. He looks desperately out 
	the window.

	His hinging point-of-view shows, down the declivity from the 
	road and half hidden by trees, three women washing clothes 
	in the river.

	Pete's reaction is enormous. He jams a fist into his mouth, 
	eyes widening. He yanks the fist out and screams:

				PETE
		PULL OVER!

	Everett, startled, does so.

	EXT.

	Before the car has even come to a stop Pete's door flies 
	open and he is stumbling down the bank to the river.

	Everett and Delmar follow more casually, Everett chuckling.

				EVERETT
		I guess o' Pete's got the itch.

	AT THE RIVER

	The unearthly singing, full volume here, comes from the three 
	women, beautiful but marked by an otherworldly langor as 
	they dunk clothes in the stream and beat them against rocks.

	Pete is all awkward smiles and deep, burning eyes:

				PETE
		Howdy do, ladies. Name of Pete!

	Strangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they 
	do smile at him as they continue to sing.

	Pete tries again as he reaches into their laundry basket:

				PETE
		Maybe I could help you with the, uh-

	He realizes he is holding ladies' undergarments.

				PETE
		Ahem. I, uh...

	He drops them back in the basket.

				PETE
		I don't believe I've, uh, heard that 
		song before...

	Everett and Delmar have arrived; Everett is loud and jovial:

				EVERETT
		Aintcha gonna innerduce us, Pete?

	Pete's eyes stay glued on the women as he hisses out of the 
	corner of his mouth:

				PETE
		Don't know their names. I seen 'em 
		first!

	Everett laughs lightly.

				EVERETT
		Ladies, you'll have to pardon my 
		friend here; Pete is dirt-ignorant 
		and unschooled in the social arts. 
		My name on the other hand is Ulysses 
		Everett McGill and you ladies are 
		about the three prettiest water lilies 
		it's ever been my privilege to admire.

	None of the women respond but, as all continue to sing, one 
	brings a jug marked with three Xes to Everett.

				EVERETT
		Why, thank you dear, that's very, 
		uh...

	He takes a swig.

				EVERETTE
		Mm. Corn licker, I guess, uh, the 
		preferred local uh...

	He passes the jug to Pete as the woman runs her fingers 
	through his hair.

	The other two women are approaching to likewise tousle Pete 
	and Delmar.

	Delmar's woman caresses his face and, by squeezing his cheeks, 
	smushes his mouth into a pucker.

				DELMAR
		Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

	The singing continues. The stream gurgles. Somewhere, in the 
	distance, flies lazily buzz.

				PETE
		Damn!

								FADE OUT

								 FADE IN

	CLOSE ON DELMAR

	We are very tight. Delmar's eyes are closed. We hear loud 
	snoring. At length his eyelids flutter open, but the snoring 
	continues.

	Delmar groggily props himself on one elbow.

	It is late afternoon. He is still on the riverbank. Everett 
	snores nearby.

	The ladies are gone. The hamper of laundry is gone. Pete is 
	gone.

	After looking blearily about for a moment, Delmar starts and 
	staggers to his feet.

				DELMAR
		Holy Saint Christopher!

	He toes Everett urgently in the ribs.

				EVERETT
		Whuhh...

				DELMAR
		Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

	Pete's clothes are laid out on the ground, not in a heap, 
	but mimicking the human shape, as if he had been simply 
	vaporized fron within them.

	Everett rouses himself and looks at the clothes: He scans 
	the opposite river bank.

				EVERETT
		PETE! Where the heck are ya! We ain't 
		got time for your shenanigans!

	Delmar stares horrified at the pile of clothes: a spot in 
	the middle of the shirt is rising and falling, rising and 
	falling.

				DELMAR
		Sweet Jesus, Everett! They left his 
		heart!

	Everett joins Delmar to look. The rhythmic rising and falling 
	now travels up the shirt. A large yellow toad sticks its 
	head out from under the collar.

	Delmar keens. Everett is bewildered.

				EVERETT
		What on earth is goin' on here! What's 
		got into you, Delmar!

				DELMAR
		Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh-
		reens did this to Pete! They loved 
		him up an' turned him into a horney-
		toad!

	The toad hops down the river bank.

				DELMAR
		Pete! Come back!

	He slides down the bank after the toad, Everett watching in 
	perturbation.

	The toad plops into the river and Delmar dives in after him. 
	He emerges a moment later with the toad wriggling in his 
	hand.

				DELMAR
		Don't worry, Pete! It's me, Delmar! 
		Oh Everett! What're we gonna do?!

	DRIVING

	We hear soft whimpering as Everett drives, sneaking worried 
	glances over at the passenger seat.

	Delmar has the toad in his lap. He whimpers as he pets it.

	Everett hesitantly offers:

				EVERETT
		...I'm not sure that's Pete.

				DELMAR
		Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

	The frog croaks.

				DELMAR
		We gotta find some kinda wizard can 
		change 'im back!

	A beat. Delmar continues to whimper.

	Everett squints and shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		...I'm just not sure that's Pete.

	FINE RESTAURANT

	The tables are formally laid with linen. Delmar and Everett 
	sit at a table, a shoebox between them, deep in conversation.

				EVERETT
		You can't display a toad in a fine 
		restaurant like this! Why, the good 
		folks here'd go right off their feed!

				DELMAR
		I just don't think it's right, keepin' 
		him under wraps like we's ashamed of 
		him.

				EVERETT
		Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of 
		him.  The way I see it he got what 
		he deserved - fornicating with some 
		whore a Babylon.  These things-

	He points a knife at the shoebox.

				EVERETT
		-don't happen for no reason, Delmar.
		Obviously it's some kind of judgment 
		on Pete's character.

	ANOTHER PATRON

	We are looking over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man 
	in a cream-colored suit and a shirt with powder-blue collar. 
	He is digging into a huge plateful of steak and eggs. Sensing 
	something, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns 
	to look back.

	He thus reveals a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue 
	trim; his good eye is looking intently off - at Everett and 
	Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	Still heatedly discussing.

				DELMAR
		The two of us was fixing to fornicate!

	The waitress has just arrived for their order. Everett gives 
	her an ingratiating laugh:

				EVERETT
		Heh-heh. You'll have to excuse my 
		rusticated friend here, unaccustomed 
		as he is to city manners.

	He ostentatiously fans some of his money.

				EVERETT
		Well mamzel I guess we'll have a 
		couple a steaks and some gratinated 
		potatoes and wash it down with your 
		finest bubbly wine-

	BIG MAN

	Watching Everett fan his money. The big man stops chewing 
	and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty 
	pat.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	As Everett closes his menu.

				EVERETT
		...And I don't suppose the chef'd 
		have any nits or grubs in the pantry, 
		or - naw, never mind, just bring me 
		a couple leafs a raw cabbage.

				WAITRESS
		Yes sir.

	The big man appears as she leaves.

				BIG MAN
		Don't believe I've seen you boys 
		around here before! Allow me 
		t'innerduce myself: name of Daniel 
		Teague, known in these precincts as 
		Big Dan Teague or, to those who're 
		pressed for time, Big Dan toot court.

				EVERETT
		How d'you do, Big Dan. I'm Ulysses 
		Everett McGill; this is my associate 
		Delmar O'Donnell.  I sense that, 
		like me, you are endowed with the 
		gift of gab.

	Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair.

				BIG DAN
		I flatter myself that such is the 
		case; in my line of work it's plumb 
		necessary. The one thing you don't 
		want is air in the conversation.

				EVERETT
		Once again we find ourselves in 
		agreement.  What kind of work do you 
		do, Big Dan?

				BIG DAN
		Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what 
		do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed 
		word of it, from Genesee on down to 
		Revelations! That's right, the word 
		of God, which let me add there is 
		damn good money in during these days 
		of woe and want! Folks're lookin' 
		for answers and Big Dan Teague sells 
		the only book that's got 'em! What 
		do you do - you and your tongue-tied 
		friend?

				DELMAR
		Uh, we uh-

				EVERETT
		We're adventurers, sir, currently 
		pursuin' a certain opportunity but 
		open to others as well.

				BIG DAN
		I like your style, young man, so I'm 
		gonna propose you a proposition. You 
		cover my check so I don't have to 
		run back up to my room, have your 
		waitress wrap your dinner picnic-
		style, and we'll retire to more 
		private environs where I will explain 
		to you how vast amounts of money can 
		be made in the service of God Amighty.

	Everett rises and digs in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		Well, why not. If nothing else I 
		could use some civilized conversation.

	As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a 
	tilt of the head and a crinkling smile.

				BIG DAN
		Don't forget your shoebox, friend.

	We hear bellowing issuing from a curtained private dining-
	room.

	INSIDE THE PRIVATE ROOM

	Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of 
	whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue.

				PAPPY
		Languishing! Goddamn campaign is 
		languishing! We need a shot inna 
		arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn 
		ARM!  Election held tomorra, that 
		sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a 
		walk!

				JUNIOR
		Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

	Pappy narrows his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting 
	at.

				PAPPY
		...Yeah?

				JUNIOR
		Well people like that reform. Maybe 
		we should get us some.

	Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it.

				PAPPY
		I'll reform you, you soft-headed 
		sonofabitch! How we gonna run reform 
		when we're the damn incumbent!

	He glares around the table.

				PAPPY
		Zat the best idea any you boys can 
		come up with? REEform?! Weepin' Jesus 
		on the cross! Eckard, you may as 
		well start draftin' my concession 
		speech right now.

	Eckard grunts as he starts to rise.

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	Pappy whips him back down with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'm just makin' a point, you stupid 
		sonofabitch!

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	As he settles back Eckard looks around the table and helpfully 
	relays:

				ECKARD
		Pappy just makin' a point here, boys.

	A MEADOW

	The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off 
	the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with 
	bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak.

	Everett, Delmar and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large 
	picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of 
	chicken off a bone.

	He tosses the bone over his shoulder, belches, and sighs.

				BIG DAN
		Thankee boys for throwin' in that 
		fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite 
		and even with lunch under my belt I 
		was feeling a mite peckish.

				EVERETT
		Our pleasure, Big Dan.

				BIG DAN
		And thank you as well for that 
		conversational hiatus; I generally 
		refrain from speech while engaged in 
		gustation. There are those who attempt 
		both at the same time but I find it 
		course and vulgar. Now where were 
		we?

				DELMAR
		Makin' money in the Lord's service.

				BIG DAN
		You don't say much friend, but when 
		you do it's to the point and I salute 
		you for it.

	Delmar is pleased and embarrassed.

				DELMAR
		Oh, it weren't nothin', I-

				BIG DAN
		Yes, Bible sales. The trade is not a 
		complicated one; there're but two 
		things to learn. One bein' where to 
		find your wholesaler - word of God 
		in bulk as it were. Two bein' how to 
		reckanize your customer - who're you 
		dealin' with? - an exercise in 
		psychology so to speak.

	He rises to his feet and tosses down his napkin.

				BIG DAN
		And it is that which I propose to 
		give you a lesson in right now.

	He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off 
	a tree. He casually strips its twigs.

				EVERETT
		I like to think that I'm a pretty 
		astute observer of the human scene.

				BIG DAN
		No doubt, brother - I figured as 
		much back there in the restaurant. 
		That's why I invited you out here 
		for this advanced tutorial.

	His club is ready. He swings at Delmar who staggers back 
	with a grunt.

	Everett wears a puzzled smile.

				EVERETT
		...What's goin' on, Big Dan?

	Delmar, though stunned, is faster to size things up. He 
	charges Big Dan and wraps his arms around him.

	Delmar roars.

	Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head.

	Everett is still puzzled, but willing to be instructed:

				EVERETT
		Big Dan, what're you doin'?

	Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still 
	attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear. Big 
	Dan takes a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow 
	to Everett.

	The blow catches Everett on the chin and sends him reeling.

				BIG DAN
		It's all about money, boys! Atsy 
		answer! Dough re mi!

	Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away. He whacks 
	Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then paws through his 
	pockets.

				BIG DAN
		Do unto others before they do unto 
		you!

	He pulls out their wad of cash.

				BIG DAN
		I'll just take your show cards...

	He walks over to Delmar who is on the ground moaning, and 
	kicks him several times.

				BIG DAN
		...and whatever you got in the hole.

	He takes Delmar's shoebox and flips off the top.

	Inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it.

				BIG DAN
		What the...

	He pokes around the straw with his finger; nothing else 
	inside.

				BIG DAN
		It's nothin' but a damn toad!

	Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes.

	Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist.

	Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips:

				DELMAR
		No... you don't understand...

				BIG DAN
		Don't you boys know these things 
		give ya warts?

	He squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against 
	a tree.

				DELMAR
		Oh Lord... Pete...

	Big Dan is over at the car, cranking it up.

				BIG DAN
		End of lesson.

	He climbs in.

				BIG DAN
		So long, boys! Hee-hee! See ya in 
		the funny papers!

	The car belches and pops and toodles off down the road.

	Delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass 
	of the frog, weeping.

				DELMAR
		Pete... Pete... Pete...

								FADE OUT

	PAN DOWN FROM BLACK TO BRING IN A TORCH

	Flickering in the night. We hear the rumble of distant thunder 
	as the continued pan down brings the torch's bearer into 
	frame - a man with the slavering grin of the dim-witted 
	sadist. He watches as we hear:

				VOICE
		Where are they?!

	There is the sound of a lash and a scream.

				VOICE
		Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a 
		whore! Where they headed?

	Another lash brings another scream.

	The screams come from Pete. His arms, stretched high over 
	his head, are tied to a tree limb. His interrogator wields a 
	bullwhip.

				INTERROGATOR
		Your screams ain't gonna save your 
		flesh! Only your tongue is, boy!

	Another lash, another scream.

				INTERROGATOR
		Where they headed!

	A third man walks into the torchlight, a hound drooling at 
	his heels. He is Cooley, the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses 
	whom we remember from previous barn confrontations.

				COOLEY
		Lump. I.O.

	The two men acknowledge by backing away from Pete.

	We hear a pat... pat... and then the accelerating pitter-
	patter of arriving rain.

	Cooley looks up.

				COOLEY
		Sweet summer rain. Like God's own 
		mercy.

	He looks back down at Pete.

				COOLEY
		Your two friends have abandoned you, 
		Pete.  They don't seem to care 'bout 
		your hide.

	He shrugs, looks off.

				COOLEY
		...Okay.

	Looking up, into black: a rope is tossed up - it recedes out 
	of the torchlight into black night - and then drops back 
	down into the light, a noose bouncing at its end.

				COOLEY
		Stairway to heaven, Pete.

	The two henchmen fit the noose over Pete's neck. Cooley licks 
	his lips. His dog slobbers.

				COOLEY
		We shall all meet, by and by.

				PETE
		Goddamnit!

	Cooley holds up one hand. The two men pause in fitting the 
	noose.

	Pete is sobbing:

				PETE
		Godfer gimme!

	Thunder crashes.

	BACK OF A HAYTRUCK

	Everett and Delmar sit disconsolately on a haybale as the 
	stakebed truck bounces along a rough country road. They are 
	both ill-kempt and heavily bruised.

	Though still an undammable river of verbiage, Everett now 
	seems to be talking out of weary habit, not conviction:

				EVERETT
		Believe me, Delmar, he would've wanted 
		us to press on. Pete, rest his soul, 
		was one sour-assed sonofabitch and 
		not given to acts of pointless 
		sentimentality.

	Delmar doggedly shakes his head.

				DELMAR
		It just don't seem right, diggin' up 
		that treasure without him.

	We distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting. Hollow-
	eyed, Everett tries to convince himself as much as Delmar:

				EVERETT
		Maybe it's for the best that Pete 
		was squushed. Why, he was barely a 
		sentient bein'. Now, soon as we clean 
		ourselves up, get a little smell'um 
		in our hair, we're just gonna feel a 
		hunnert per cent better about 
		ourselves and about...

	His voice trails away as he looks out at the road.

	They are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and 
	duck-billed caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side 
	of the road. Guards bearing shotguns amble back and forth.

	As he stares at the line of men Everett tries to pick up his 
	thread:

				EVERETT
		...and about... life in general...

	The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust.

				EVERETT
		Jesus. We must be near Parchman Farm.

	The men, giving throat to a dolorous chain-gang chant, do 
	not look up at the passing haytruck.

	Everett is haunted:

				EVERETT
		Sorry sonsabitches... Seems like a 
		year ago we bust off the farm...

	The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, 
	looks up. Everett stares.

	It is Pete.

	Lone and lorn, he returns Everett's slack-jawed stare until 
	heat ripples and the truck's dusty wake dissolve him away.

	Everett blinks.

				EVERETT
		Pete have a brother?

				DELMAR
		Not that I'm aware.

	Everett shakes his head as if to clear it.

				EVERETT
		Heat must be gettin' to me.

	The truck rattles on.

	TOWN SQUARE

	Ithaca, Mississippi. On a bunting-covered stage a pencil-
	necked man with round rimless glasses addresses a crowd of 
	rustics.

	The pencil-neck is identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, 
	Friend of the Little Man', and, in life as in the pictures, 
	he shakes a broom over his head. A midget in overalls stands 
	next to him.

				STOKES
		And I say to you that the great state 
		a Mississippi cannot afford four 
		more years a Pappy O'Daniel - four 
		more years a cronyism, nepotism, 
		rascalism and service to the 
		Innarests!  The choice, she's a clear 
		'un: Pappy O'Daniel, slave a the 
		Innarests; Homer Stokes, servant a 
		the little man! Ain't that right, 
		little fella?

	The midget enthusiastically seconds:

				MIDGET
		He ain't lyin'!

				STOKES
		When the litle man says jump, Homer 
		Stokes says how high? And, ladies'n 
		jettymens, the little man has 
		admonished me to grasp the broom a -
		ree-form and sweep this state clean!

	The midget waves his little midget broom in time with Stoke's 
	waves.

				STOKES
		It's gonna be back to the flour mill, 
		Pappy! The Innarests can take care a 
		theyselves! Come Tuesday, we gonna 
		sweep the rascals out! Clean gummint - 
		yours for the askin'!

	He beams amid cheers and then, as three girls in gingham 
	frocks run out to join him:

				STOKES
		An' now - the little Wharvey gals!  
		Whatcha got for us, darlin's?

	The oldest girl is about ten.

				LITTLE GIRL
		'In the Highways'!

				STOKES
		That's fine.

	The haytruck has pulled into the square and Everett and Delmar 
	are climbing out.

	Everett stares at the stage.

				EVERETT
		Wharvey gals?! Did he just say the 
		little Wharvey gals?

	Delmar shrugs. For some reason, Everett is enraged:

				EVERETT
		Goddamnit all!

	Onstage, the three girls are singing in untrained but 
	enthusiastic harmony:

				GIRLS
		In the highways, In the hedges...

	Everett stomps toward the stage, fighting his way through 
	the crowd. Puzzled, Delmar follows.

				DELMAR
		You know them gals, Everett?

	Everett reaches the stage and climbs up into the wings just 
	as the song ends. The midget starts buck-dancing to a fiddle 
	tune as the three little girls, filing off, notice Everett.

				YOUNGEST
		Daddy!

				MIDDLE
		He ain't our daddy!

				EVERETT
		Hell I ain't! Whatsis 'Wharvey' gals? - 
		Your name's McGill!

				YOUNGEST
		No sir! Not since you got hit by a 
		train!

				EVERETT
		What're you talkin' about - I wasn't 
		hit by a train!

				MIDDLE
		Mama said you was hit by a train!

				YOUNGEST
		Blooey!

				OLDEST
		Nothin' left!

				MIDDLE
		Just a grease spot on the L&N!

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I never been hit by any train!

				OLDEST
		At's right! So Mama's got us back to 
		Wharvey!

				MIDDLE
		That's a maiden name.

				YOUNGEST
		You got a maiden name, Daddy?

				EVERETT
		No, Daddy ain't got a maiden name; 
		ya see -

				MIDDLE
		That's your misfortune!

				YOUNGEST
		At's right! And now Mama's got a new 
		beau!

				OLDEST
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Yeah, I know 'bout that.

				MIDDLE
		Mama says he's bona fide!

	This worries Everett:

				EVERETT
		Hm. He give her a ring?

				YOUNGEST
		Yassir, big'un!

				MIDDLE
		Gotta gem!

				OLDEST
		Mama checked it!

				YOUNGEST
		It's bona fide!

				MIDDLE
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Hm. What's his name?

				MIDDLE
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				YOUNGEST
		Uncle Vernon.

				OLDEST
		Till tomorrow.

				YOUNGEST
		Then he's gonna be Daddy!

				EVERETT
		I'm the only damn daddy you got! I'm 
		the damn paterfamilias!

				OLDEST
		Yeah, but you ain't bona fide!

				EVERETT
		Hm. Where's your mama?

	Stokes is announcing from the stage:

				STOKES
		And now let's fetch back the Wharvey 
		gals to sing 'I'll Fly Away'.

	The girls call over their shoulders as they run back onstage:

				MIDDLE
		She's at the five and dime.

				YOUNGEST
		Buyin' nipples!

	WOOLWORTH'S

	The faces of a six-year-old girl and her four-year-old sister 
	light up.

				GIRLS
		Daddy!

	Next to them is a two-year-old girl with a string wrapped 
	around her waist. The other end of the string is held by a 
	woman in her thirties with a haggard, careworn face. The 
	woman also holds a babe-in-arms.

	Everett, entering, goggles at the infant.

				EVERETT
		Who the hell is that?!

				WOMAN
		Starla Wharvey.

				EVERETT
		Starla McGill you mean! How come you 
		never told me about her?

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		'Cause you was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		And that's another thing - why're 
		you tellin' our gals I was hit by a 
		train!

				WOMAN
		Lotta respectable people been hit by 
		trains. Judge Hobby over in Cookeville 
		was hit by a train. What was I 
		supposed to tell 'em - that you was 
		sent to the penal farm and I divorced 
		you from shame?

				EVERETT
		Well - I take your point. But it 
		leaves me in a damned awkward position 
		vis-a-vis my progeny.

	A man in a straw boater joins them.

				BOATER
		'Lo Penny... This gentleman bothering 
		you?

				EVERETT
		You Waldrip?

				BOATER
		That's right.

	Everett sniffs and, catching a scent, squints.

	Waldrip's hair, protruding from under his boater, is plastered 
	against his scalp.

				EVERETT
		...Have you been using my hair 
		treatment?

				WALDRIP
		Your hair treatment?!

	Everett covers his anger with an exaggerated politeness.

				EVERETT
		S'cuse me...

	He draws Penny aside.

				EVERETT
		Well, I got news for you case you 
		hadn't noticed - I wasn't hit by a 
		train. And I've traveled many a weary 
		mile to be back with my wife and six 
		daughters.

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		Seven, Daddy!

				PENNY
		That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. 
		Your daddy was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		Now Penny, stop that!

				PENNY
		No - you stop it! Vernon here's got 
		a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's 
		bona fide! What're you?

				EVERETT
		I'll tell you what I am - I'm the 
		paterfamilias! You can't marry him!

				PENNY
		I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! 
		I gotta think about the little Wharvey 
		gals! They look to me for answers! 
		Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em 
		lessons on the clarinet! The only 
		good thing you ever did for the gals 
		was get his by that train!

				EVERETT
		...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... 
		succubus!

				WALDRIP
		You can't swear at my fiancee!

				EVERETT
		Oh yeah? Well you can't marry my 
		wife!

	With this he takes a wild swing which Waldrip easily eludes.   
	Waldrip adapts a Marquess of Queensbury stance and prances 
	about, delivering stinging punches to the nose of a stunned 
	and outclassed Everett.

	A crowd is gathering and voices murmur:

				BYSTANDERS
		Who is that man?

				PENNY
		He's not my husband. Just a drifter, 
		I guess... Just some no-account 
		drifter...

	EXT. WOOLWORTH'S

	Its glass doors swing open and Everett is hurled out and 
	bellyflops into the dust of the street.

				BRAWNY MANAGER
		...And stay out of Woolworth's!

	MOVIE THEATER

	Romantic music tinnily plays as Delmar and Everett watch, 
	Everett slumped down and angrily hissing:

				EVERETT
		Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! 
		Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember 
		that one simple precept and your 
		time with me will not have been ill 
		spent!

				DELMAR
		Okay, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' 
		to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the 
		subjective!  You ever been with a 
		woman?

				DELMAR
		Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family 
		farm back before I can start thinkin' 
		about that.

				EVERETT
		Well that's right! If then! Believe 
		me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish 
		instrument of torture ever devised 
		to bedevil the days a man!

				DELMAR
		Everett, I never figured you for a 
		paterfamilias.

				EVERETT
		Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. 
		And you see what it, uh... what it's 
		earned me... Now what in the...

	The screen is flickering down to black as the music slows to 
	sludge and stops.

	The theater is dark and quiet.

	Everett and Delmar, and the rest of the sparse audience, 
	look restively about.

	A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium.

	He walks halfway down the aisle and stops several rows behind 
	Delmar and Everett. He scans the theater, then brings a 
	whistle to his lips.

	At his whistle the back doors burst open and a line of chained 
	men trot in at double-time. With much clanking they file 
	into one row and then, that row filled, the one behind it. 
	They remain silently on their feet.

	The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts 
	scan the theater. The first guard again blows his whistle.

	The two rows of chained men sit.

	After another silence:

				FIRST GUARD
		...Okay boys! Enjoy yer pickcha show!

	One more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed.

	A hissing whisper from behind draws Everett and Delmar's 
	attention:

				VOICE
		Do not seek the treasure! It's a 
		bushwhack!

	Everett and Delmar turn and stare, saucer-eyed. In the middle 
	of the frontmost row of convicts sits Pete - bald, haunted 
	Pete.

	After a long, disbelieving stare:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

	Pete whispers again, urgently:

				PETE
		They're fixin' a ambush! Do not seek 
		the treasure!

	Everett, jaw hanging open, can only stare, as if at a ghost. 
	Delmar stares also, but finally brings out another:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

				PETE
		Do not seek the treasure!

	Everett's face remains frozen in horrified disbelief, but 
	Delmar finally accepts Pete's corporeal reality.

				DELMAR
		We thought you was a toad!

	Pete squints and cocks his head as if to say, What was that?

	Delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth 
	movements:

				DELMAR
		We thought... you was... a toad!

	Pete shakes his head - didn't catch it - and repeats, also 
	overarticulating:

				PETE
		Do not... seek... the treasure!

	A guard murmurs:

				GUARD
		Quiet there. Watcha pickcha.

	VERANDA

	Pappy O'Daniel sits on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion, 
	smoking a cigar and sipping from a glass of bourbon as the 
	evening sun goes down.

				PAPPY
		I signed that bill! I signed a dozen 
		a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone 
		knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! 
		What do I gotta do, start diddlin' 
		livestock?!

				JUNIOR
		We cain't do that, Daddy, we might 
		offend our constichency.

				PAPPY
		We ain't got a constichency! Stokes 
		got a constichency!

				ECKARD
		Them straw polls is ugly.

				SPIVEY
		Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.

				ECKARD
		Gonna pluck us off the tit.

				SPIVEY
		Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants 
		down and Stokes at the table soppin' 
		up the gravy.

				ECKARD
		Latch right on to that tit.

				SPIVEY
		Wipin' little circles with his bread.

				ECKARD
		Suckin' away.

				SPIVEY
		Well, it's a well-run campaign, 
		midget'n broom'n whatnot.

				ECKARD
		Devil his due.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva awgazation.

				JUNIOR
		Say, I gotten idee.

				ECKARD
		What sat, Junior?

				JUNIOR
		We could hire us a little fella even 
		smaller'n Stokes's.

	Pappy whips at him with his hat.

				PAPPY
		Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a 
		guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha 
		satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies 
		braggin' on our own midget! Don't 
		matter how stumpy! And that's the 
		goddamn problem right there - people 
		think this Stokes got fresh ideas, 
		he's oh coorant and we the past.

				ECKARD
		Problem a p'seption.

				SPIVEY
		Ass right.

				ECKARD
		Reason why he's pullin' ah pants 
		down.

				SPIVEY
		Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.

				ECKARD
		Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna 
		kick it real hard.

	With his mouth forming an O around his dropping cigar, Pappy 
	looks sadly from one to the other, like a spectator at a 
	particularly boring tennis match.

				SPIVEY
		No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle 
		it.

				ECKARD
		Well now, I don't believe assa 
		property scription.

				SPIVEY
		Well, that's how I characterize it.

				ECKARD
		Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' 
		sichation.

				SPIVEY
		Pullin' ah pants down...

				ECKARD
		Wipin' little circles with his 
		bread...

	A NOOSE

	In slow motion it is dropping... dropping... dropping through 
	the night. We hear distant thunder and the howl of a hound. 
	The sounds recede, and the black background dissolves into a 
	pan down from a raftered ceiling as the noose fades away.

	The continued pan down shows that we are in a barracks-like 
	cabin. It is night. Convicts are ranged in bunk-beds. Their 
	snores stand out against the chirp of crickets.

	In the upper berth of the foreground bed is Pete. His hands 
	are clasped behind his head. A manacle and chain links one 
	wrist to a rail that serves as headboard.

	He stares up, haunted, at the phantom noose.

				PETE
		I could not gaze upon that far 
		shore...

	He reacts quizically to a whispered:

				VOICE
		Pete!

	A moment later Everett rises over the lip of his bed. His 
	face is blacked and he sways as if standing on a boat.

				EVERETT
		Hold still.

	He is raising a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering 
	tool. He locks the nose onto Pete's chain and levers the 
	arms. As his hand chinks free, Pete does not react to his 
	newfound liberty.

	We hear an agonized voice from off as Everett continues to 
	sway:

				DELMAR
		...Cain't stand much longer.

	Pete's eyes burn into Everett's.

				PETE
		It was a moment a weakness!

				EVERETT
		Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to 
		skedaddle.

	THE THREE MEN

	We track with them as they walk through the moonlit woods. 
	Delmar's and Everett's faces are thoroughly blacked; Pete is 
	just finishing blacking his, and he hands the shoe polish 
	back to Everett.

				PETE
		They lured me out for a bathe, then 
		they dunked me'n trussed me up like 
		a hog and turned me in for the bounty.

				EVERETT
		I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly 
		behavior. Just lucky we left before 
		they came for us.

				DELMAR
		We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just 
		thought you was a toad.

				PETE
		No, they never did turn me into a 
		toad.

				DELMAR
		Well that was our mistake then. And 
		then we was beat up by a bible 
		salesman and banished from 
		Woolworth's. I don't know if it's 
		the one branch or all of 'em.

				PETE
		Well I - I ain't had it easy either, 
		boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled 
		my guts about the treasure.

				DELMAR
		Huh?!

				PETE
		Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; 
		must be my Hogwallop blood.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right, Pete.

	Pete is shaking his head, miserable.

				PETE
		It's awful white of ya to take it 
		like that, Everett. I feel wretched, 
		spoilin' yer play for a million 
		dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' 
		at my guts.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right.

	Pete starts weeping.

				PETE
		You boys're true friends!

	He hugs a stunned Delmar.

				PETE
		You're m'boon companions!

	He hugs Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable.

				EVERETT
		Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat 
		yourself up about this thing...

				PETE
		I cain't help it, but that's a 
		wonderful thing to say!

				EVERETT
		Well, but Pete...

	He clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Uh, the fact of the matter is - well, 
		damnit, there ain't no treasure!

	Now it is Pete's turn to be stunned. He and Delmar stare at 
	Everett.

				EVERETT
		Fact of the matter - there never 
		was!

				PETE
		But... but...

				DELMAR
		So - where's all the money from your 
		armored-car job?

				EVERETT
		I never knocked over any armored-
		car. I was sent up for practicing 
		law without a license.

				PETE
		But...

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My 
		wife wrote me she was gettin' married! 
		I gotta stop it!

	Pete stares vacantly off.

				PETE
		...No treasure... I had two weeks 
		left on my sentence...

				EVERETT
		I couldn't wait two weeks! She's 
		gettin' married tomorra!

				PETE
		...With my added time for the escape, 
		I don't get out now 'til 1987... 
		I'll be eighty-four years old.

	Delmar, not angry himself, is trying to work it out.

				DELMAR
		Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty 
		years for me too.

				EVERETT
		Boys, we was chained together. I 
		hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out 
		alone was not a option!

				PETE
		...Eighty-four years old.

	Delmar brightens.

				DELMAR
		I'll only be eighty-two.

	Pete lunges at Everett.

				PETE
		YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

	He tackles him and, with his hands wrapped round Everett's 
	throat, the two roll over.

				EVERETT
			(strangled)
		Pete... I do apologize.

				PETE
		Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' 
		pab-you-lum!

	They have rolled through some brush and their bodies are now 
	halfway into a clearing. They abruptly stop.

	Pete, lying on top of Everett, looks up, startled by loud 
	chanting. Everett, lying on his back, tries to see as well, 
	his eyes rolling back in his head.

	Their point-of-view shows a great open field where men in 
	bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross.

	Pete and Everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and 
	then push through with Delmar.

	The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, 
	intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At 
	length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to 
	face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning 
	cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold.

	An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the 
	burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The 
	backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from 
	the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett.

	As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, 
	whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet.

				BLACK MAN
		I ain't never harmed any you 
		gentlemen!

	Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		It's Tommy! They got Tommy!

				DELMAR
		Oh my God!

	It is indeed Tommy Johnson.

				TOMMY
		I ain't never harmed nobody!

	Pete is staring aghast at the makeshift gibbet.

				PETE
		The noose. Sweet Jesus! We gotta 
		save 'im!

	A broad-shouldered man in the middle of the ranks of Klansmen, 
	sensing something, slowly turns to look back over his 
	shoulder. He thus reveals that his hood has only one eye-
	hole.

	He slowly draws off his hood. It is, of course, Big Dan 
	Teague. His one good eye looks about; his other eye, now 
	revealed, is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed 
	sightlessness.

	Everett, still crouched behind the bushes, notices something. 
	He hisses and points.

				EVERETT
		The color guard.

	Off to one side is a robed and hooded three-man color guard 
	displaying a Confederate flag.

	In front of the crowd the Imperial Wizard raises one satin-
	draped arm, and the chanting stops.

				WIZARD
		Brothers! We are foregathered here 
		to preserve our hallowed culture'n 
		heritage!  From intrusions, inclusions 
		and dilutions!  Of culluh! Of creed! 
		Of our ol'-time religion!

	Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening 
	up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having 
	disposed of the color guard.

				WIZARD
		We aim to pull evil up by the root! 
		Before it chokes out the flower of 
		our culture'n heritage! And our women! 
		Let's not forget those ladies, y'all, 
		lookin' to us for p'tection! From 
		darkies! From Jews! From Papists! 
		And from all those smart-ass folk 
		say we come descended from the 
		monkeys!  That's not my culture'n 
		heritage!

	A roar from the crowd.

				WIZARD
		Izzat your culture'n heritage?

	Another roar.

				WIZARD
		And so... we gonna hang us a neegra!

	A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting.

	The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the 
	two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy! It's us!

	Behind Everett in the deep background someone emerges from 
	the ranks into the middle aisle. He approaches with a strong, 
	purposeful stride - Big Dan Teague, bareheaded, holding his 
	hood under his arm.

	Everett hisses again:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy!

	Tommy looks back over his shoulder.

				TOMMY
		...Huh?

	Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind.

				EVERETT
		It's us! We come to rescue ya!

				TOMMY
		That's mighty kind of ya boys, but I 
		don't think nothin's gonna save me 
		now - the devil's come to collect 
		his due!

				PETE
		Tommy, you don't wanna get hanged!

				TOMMY
		Naw I don't guess I do, but that's 
		the way it seems to be workin' out.

				EVERETT
		Listen to me, Tommy, I got a plan -

	Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. 
	Everett is exposed - in blackface.

	The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned.

	Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in 
	blackface.

	From the crowd:

				VOICE
		The color guard is colored!

	Big Dan roars.

	The crowd roars.

	Everett screams:

				EVERETT
		Run, boys!

	Pandemonium breaks out, and the Imperial Wizard takes off 
	his red satin hood for a better view.

	He is the reform candidate Homer Stokes. Next to him, his 
	midget also pulls of his midget hood.

	Stokes is peeved.

				STOKES
		Who made them the color guard?

	Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate 
	flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating 
	the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues 
	in full cry.

	When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. 
	He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd.

	Homer Stokes is mortified.

				STOKES
		Damn! Can't let that flag touch the 
		ground!

	The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence.

	The only sound is the fluttering flag.

	Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the 
	flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend.

	We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned 
	white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague.

	His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off 
	returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging 
	distance and trajectory.

	From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping.

	The flag flutters.

	The crowd is silent.

	Big Dan sets and...

	WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together.

	He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the 
	ground.

	The crowd cheers.

	Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers.

	From somewhere, another BOINK.

	As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades.

	His eye tracks up - up-

	CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.

	At the foot of the cross Everett snaps its last guy wire 
	with his pincers - BOINK - and the four men sprint off.

	WHOOOOSH - As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward 
	Big Dan, frozen, looking up.

	It crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates 
	Big Dan Teague.

	A PACKARD

	It is pulling up in front of a town hall from which party 
	sounds filter out.

	Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the car with his retinue - Eckard, 
	Spivey and Junior.

				PAPPY
		I'm sayin' we har this man away.

				ECKARD
		Assa good idea, Pappy.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva idea.

				ECKARD
		Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

				SPIVEY
		Have him join us, run our campaign 
		'stead a that pencil-neck's.

				ECKARD
		Enticements a power, wealth, settera.

				SPIVEY
		No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

				ECKARD
		Oh gracious no. Not with his 
		blandishments.

				SPIVEY
		Powas p'suasion.

				PAPPY
		What's his name again?

				ECKARD
		Campaign manager? Waldrip.

				SPIVEY
		Vernon Waldrip.

				ECKARD
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				PAPPY
		Hmm... His folks from out Tuscarora?

				SPIVEY
		Tuscarora? Might be. I b'lieve they 
		is.

				ECKARD
		Not a doubt in my mind.

	Pappy is disgusted:

				PAPPY
		You don't know where his goddamn 
		folks from; you speakin' outcha 
		asshole.

				ECKARD
		Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it 
		that strong...

	As the three men make their way up the steps, Eckard's voice 
	is fading:

				ECKARD
		...but p'haps yaw right...

	In wide shot, they disappear into the building.

	A reverse shows the wide shot to have been the point-of-view 
	of Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy, who peek out from the 
	mouth of an alley. Everett hisses his intelligence:

				EVERETT
		Well, it's a invitation-only affair; 
		we'll have to sneak in through the 
		service entrance-

				PETE
		Wait a minute - who elected you leader 
		a this outfit? Since we been followin' 
		your lead we got nothin' but trouble! 
		I gotten this close to bein' strung 
		up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped 
		no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

				DELMAR
		'N turned into a frog -

				EVERETT
		He was never turned into a frog!

	Delmar sulks:

				DELMAR
		Almost loved up though.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		So you're against me now, too!... Is 
		that how it is, boys?

	Silence. No one wants to meet Everett's eye. He is saddened.

				EVERETT
		The whole world and God Almighty... 
		and now you. Well, maybe I deserve 
		this. Boys, I... I know I've made 
		some tactical mistakes. But if you'll 
		just stick with me; I need your help. 
		And I've got a plan.  Believe me, 
		boys, we can fix this thing! I can 
		get my wife back! We can get outta 
		here!

	Headlights play; the men suck back into the alley as a car 
	passes by.

	The car tools up to the banquet hall and Homer Stokes emerges 
	with his midget. The midget tosses his balled-up white hood 
	into the car and both men shrug into their suitcoats.

	Stokes is angry:

				STOKES
		...goddamn disgrace. Made a travesty 
		of the entire evenin'...

	They too start up the stairs. Stokes's pace is brisk and the 
	midget hops awkwardly to keep up.

				STOKES
		...what I wouldn't give to get my 
		hands on those agitators. Whoever 
		heard a such behavior. Even among 
		culluds. Or mulattos, maybe - I 
		suspect some miscegenation in their 
		heritage... how else you goin' explain 
		it - usin' the Confed'it flag as a 
		missile...

	BANQUET HALL KITCHEN

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are entering through the 
	back door. The blackface has been scrubbed off but all four 
	now wear long gray beards as disguise, clumsily affixed with 
	spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case.

	They elbow past the bustling kitchen help.

				EVERETT
		Scuse me... scuse me... we're the 
		next act...

				DELMAR
		Everett, my beard itches.

				PETE
		This is crazy. No one's ever gonna 
		believe we're a real band.

				EVERETT
		No, this is gonna work! I just gotta 
		get close enough to talk to her. 
		Takin' off with us is got a lot more 
		future in it than marrying a guy 
		named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona 
		fide. I've got the answers!

	HEAD TABLE

	Out in the banquet hall Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side 
	at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals. Penny and 
	Waldrip are facing the hall with their backs to the stage as 
	the four bearded band members - Everett, Pete, Delmar and 
	Tommy - take their places.

	Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair with an arm draped 
	over his shoulder, leaning in to murmur confidentially.  
	Waldrip sits stiffly erect as he listens, frowning at a spot 
	in space.

	Suddenly Waldrip erupts:

				WALDRIP
		Well that's a improper suggestion!  
		I can't switch sides in the middle 
		of a campaign!  Especially to work 
		for a man who lacks moral fibre!

				PAPPY
		Moral fibre?!

	He waves his cane, outraged.

				PAPPY
		You pasty-faced sonofabitch, I 
		invented moral fibre!

	Up on the stage, the band has launched into a song.

				PAPPY
		Pappy O'Daniel was displayin' 
		rectitude and high-mindedness when 
		that pencil-neck you work for was 
		still messin' his drawers!

	A hissed Voice:

				VOICE
		Psst! Penny! Hey! Up here!

	As the two men continue to exchange sharp words, penny turns 
	her head to look steeply up over her shoulder.

	Everett is up onstage just behind her. As the rest of the 
	band continues to play, he is parting his beard to hiss down 
	at her:

				EVERETT
		Penny! It's me!

	Dismayed, she shakes her head and tries to unobtrusively 
	wave him away. He is undeterred:

				EVERETT
		No, Penny, listen! We're leavin' the 
		state! Pusuin' opportunities in 
		another venue! I got big plans! Not 
		minstrelsy; this-here's just a dodge - 
		I'm gonna be a dentist! I know a guy 
		who'll print me up a license! I wanna 
		be what you want me to be, honey! I 
		want you and the gals to come with 
		me!

	She shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate 
	as Everett continues pleading to her back:

				EVERETT
		They're my daughters, Penny! I'm the 
		king a this goddamn castle!

	Stokes has ambled up to the head table.

				STOKES
		What're you doin' here, Pappy? I 
		guess someone let on there was free 
		liquor, heh-heh.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, you'll be laughin' out the 
		other side your face come November.

				ECKARD
		Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.

				SPIVEY
		Not out the other side his face, 
		though.

				ECKARD
		Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -

	This byplay is interrupted by a roar from the crowd.

	The band has launched into 'Man of Constant Sorrow', 
	precipitating the huge reaction. Everett, still trying to 
	get Penny's attention, looks up, stunned at the ovation.

	Cry from the crowd:

				VOICE
		Hot damn! Itsa Soggy Bottom Boys!

	Everett and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. 
	A shrug, and they lean into the song with a will.

	Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the 
	crowd to new heights of hysteria.

				PAPPY
		Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!

				JUNIOR
		But Pappy, they's inter-grated.

				PAPPY
		Well I guess folks don't mind they's 
		integrated.

	Stokes is also staring at the band, frowning. He murmurs to 
	himself:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute...

	Everett catches Stokes' look. The two men look at each other, 
	aghast.

	Stokes raises his voice accusingly:

				STOKES
		...you's miscegenated! All you boys!  
		Miscegenated!

	Everett raises the volume of his singing. Stokes cries out:

				STOKES
		Get me a mike-a-phone!

	A mike is thrust into his hand and he bellows into it, 
	overwhelming the music, which the boys eventually abandon. 
	Stokes continues bellowing into the silence:

				STOKES
		These boys is not white! These boys 
		is not white! Hell, they ain't even 
		ol'-timey! I happen to know, ladies'n 
		gentlemen, this band a miscreants 
		here, this very evening, they 
		interfered with a lynch mob inna 
		performance of its duties!

	The crowd stares at him, stone-faced. Stokes plows on:

				STOKES
		It's true! I b'long to a certain 
		society, I don't believe I gotta 
		mention its name, heh-heh...

	Nobody joins in the laugh; Stokes slowly strangles on it.

				STOKES
		...Ahem. And these boys here trampled 
		all over our venerated observances 
		an' rich'ls!  Now this-here music is 
		over! I aim to -

	Boos start up among the crowd.

				STOKES
		I aim to hand these boys over to - 
		listen to me, folks!

	The boos are growing in volume. There are cries of 'More 
	music!' and even one 'Shut up, pencil-neck!'

				STOKES
		Listen to me! These boys desecrated 
		a fiery cross!

	More boos. Waldrip approaches and nudges the microphone away 
	to murmur confidentially in Stokes' ear. Stokes excitedly 
	retrieves the mike and struggles to be heard:

				STOKES
		And they convicts! Fugitives, folks, 
		escaped off the farm!

	This cuts no ice; the boos have become overwhelming.

				STOKES
		Folks, these boys gotta be remanded 
		the 'thorities! Criminals! And I 
		happen to have it from the highest 
		authority that that Neegra sold his 
		soul to the devil!

	He is hit by a tomato.

	The boos are deafening; the Soggy Bottom Boys, sensing 
	opportunity, launch back into the interrupted verse of 'Man 
	of Constant Sorrow'. The boos become wild cheers.

	Stokes is being pelted by foodstuffs. Shielding himself with 
	one arm, he bellows into the mike:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Is you 
		is or is you ain't my constichency?

	INT. RUSTIC CABIN

	Far up some sleepy holler. An old man in overalls and his 
	wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny 
	voice. They look at each other wordlessly, look back at the 
	crystal set.

	BACK TO BANQUET HALL

	Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks 
	apprehensively on.

				STOKES
		Is you is or is you ain't -

	A disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug; 
	Stokes continues to mouth the inaudible words.

	Pappy is considering the crowd.

				PAPPY
		Goddamn! Oppitunity knocks!

	He starts clambering up onto the stage.

	Two men advance through the clapping audience holding high 
	either end of an eight-foot rail. When they reach Stokes, 
	other audience members help load him onto the rail.

	Onstage, Pappy claps along with the audience.

	As they play, the band members fearfully eye Pappy, who 
	advances on them.

	Pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and 
	does a little two-step. The audience roars. The band relaxes, 
	performing with even more gusto.

	Stokes is being through the crowd on the rail, jeered at and 
	pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit.

	As the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars 
	approval, and Pappy elbows in to the microphone, beaming.

				PAPPY
		That's fine, that's fine!...

	He drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar.

				PAPPY
		...Ladies'n gentlemens here and 
		listenin' at home, the great state 
		of Mississippi (Pappy O'Daniel, 
		Gov'nor) thanks the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys for that won-a-ful performance!

	Cheers.

				PAPPY
		Now it looks like the only man in 
		our great state who ain't a music 
		luvva, is my esteemed opponent in 
		the upcomin', Homer Stokes -

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, well, they ain't no accountin' 
		f'taste. It sounded t'me like he 
		harbored some kind a hateful grudge 
		against the Soggy Bottom Boys on 
		account a their rough'n rowdy past.

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Sounds like Homer Stokes is the kinda 
		fella gonna cast the first stone!

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Well I'm with you folks. I'm a f'give 
		and f'get Christian. And I say, well, 
		if their rambunctiousness and 
		misdemeanorin' is behind 'em - It 
		is, ain't it, boys?

	Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going.

				EVERETT
		Sure is, Governor.

				PAPPY
		Why then I say, by the par vested in 
		me, these boys is hereby pardoned!

	Loud cheers prod Pappy to another level of inspiration:

				PAPPY
		And furthermore, in the second Pappy 
		O'Daniel administration, why, these 
		boys - is gonna be my brain trust!

	Raucous cheers.

	The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried:

				DELMAR
		What sat mean exactly, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are 
		gonna be the power behind the throne 
		so to speak.

				DELMAR
		Oh, okay.

				PAPPY
		So now, without further ado, and by 
		way of endorsin' my candidacy, the 
		Soggy Bottom Boys is gonna lead us 
		all in a chorus of 'You Are My 
		Sunshine' - ain't ya, boys?

	He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for 
	a considering beat.

				EVERETT
		...Governor - that's one of our 
		favorites!

	Pappy returns a considered appraisal:

				PAPPY
		Son, you gonna go far.

	The song begins.

	LATER

	The steps of the meeting hall. People stream out of the 
	concert into the warm summer night.

	Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps 
	with Penny.

				EVERETT
		I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna 
		be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be 
		able to throw a little patronage his 
		way, get the man a job diggin' ditches 
		or rounding up stray dogs.

				DELMAR
		Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

				PENNY
		McGill. No, the marriage'll take 
		place as planned.

				EVERETT
		Just a little change of cast. Me and 
		the little lady are gonna pick up 
		the pieces'n retie the knot, 
		mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're 
		invited, of course. Hell, you're 
		best men! Already got the rings.

	He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their 
	wedding bands - but Penny's finger is bare.

				EVERETT
		Where's your ring, honey?

				PENNY
		I ain't worn it since our divorce 
		came through. It must still be in 
		the rolltop in the old cabin. Never 
		thought I'd need it; Vernon bought 
		one encrusted with jewels.

				EVERETT
		Hell, now's the time to buy it off 
		him cheap.

				PENNY
		We ain't gettin' married with his 
		ring!  You said you'd changed!

				EVERETT
		Aw, honey, our ring is just a old 
		pewter thing -

				PENNY
		Ain't gonna be no weddin'.

				EVERETT
		It's just a symbol, honey -

				PENNY
		No weddin'.

				DELMAR
		We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar -
		it's just -

				PENNY
		I have spoken my piece and counted 
		to three.

	She walks off.

				EVERETT
		Oh, goddamnit! She counted to three!  
		Sonofabitch! You know how far that 
		cabin is?!

	His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession 
	on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a 
	man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being 
	escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their 
	nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation.

	Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the 
	last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar 
	cries out:

				DELMAR
		George!

	It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his 
	heavy restraints.

				GEORGE
		'Lo, boys! Well, these little men 
		finally caught up with the criminal 
		a the century! Looks like the chair 
		for George Nelson. Yup! Gonna 
		electrify me!  I'm gonna go off like 
		a Roman candle!  Twenty thousand 
		volts chasin' the rabbit through 
		yours truly! Gonna shoot sparks out 
		the top of my head and lightning 
		from my fingertips!

	As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder:

				GEORGE
		Yessir! Gonna suck all the power 
		right outa the state! Goddamn, boys, 
		I'm on top of the world! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go.

				DELMAR
		Looks like George is right back on 
		top again.

	BLACK

	In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer, 
	slobberier.

	A crack of light. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being 
	nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout.

	As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed 
	with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, 
	several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	PINEY WOODS

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods.

				EVERETT
		Well, at least you boys'll get to 
		see the old manse - the home where I 
		spent so many happy days in the bosom 
		of my family - a refugium, if you 
		will - with a mighty oak tree out 
		front and a happy little tire swing...

	They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. 
	It is indeed a peaceful-looking haven with a mighty oak tree 
	in front. There is, however, no tire swing; instead, three 
	nooses hang from one stout limb.

				DELMAR
		Where's the happy little tire swing?

	Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and 
	push them forward.

	Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-
	dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough 
	pine coffin.

	The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the 
	porch, the drooling hound at his heels.

				COOLEY
		End of the road, boys. It's had its 
		twists and turns -

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		- but now it deposits you here.

	The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three 
	gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from 
	the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas 
	round their necks.

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		You have eluded fate - and eluded me - 
		for the last time. Tie their hands, 
		boys.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this -

				COOLEY
		Didn't know you'd be bringin' a 
		friend.  Well, he'll have to wait 
		his turn -

				EVERETT
		Hang on there -

				COOLEY
		- and share one of your graves.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this - we just been 
		pardoned!  By the Governer himself!

				DELMAR
		It went out over the radio!

				COOLEY
		Is that right?

	The leering goons, who have been lashing the men's wrists 
	behind their backs, pause, their sadism stymied. They look 
	to Cooley for guidance.

	So too does the drooling hound.

	Silence.

	Finally:

				COOLEY
		...Too bad we don't have a radio.

	The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy 
	task.

	The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their 
	shovels. They begin to sing a slow and dirgelike 'You've Got 
	to Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens on them and 
	trickles down their faces like tears.

				PETE
		God have Mercy!

				TOMMY
		It ain't fittin'!

				EVERETT
		It ain't the law!

				COOLEY
		The law. Well the law is a human 
		institution.

	Cooley gives the faintest smile.

				COOLEY
		Perhaps you should take a moment for 
		your prayers.

				PETE
		Oh my God! Everett!

				DELMAR
		I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

				PETE
		Good Lord, what do we do?

	Pete is in tears. Tommy is terrified. Delmar bows his head 
	to silently pray.

	Everett bows his head as well. He murmurs:

				EVERETT
		Oh Lord, please look down and 
		recognize us poor sinners... please 
		Lord...

	The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell.

				EVERETT
		...I just want to see my daughters 
		again.  Oh Lord, I've been separated 
		from my family for so long...

	The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more 
	palpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of 
	the earth itself.

				EVERETT
		...I know I've been guilty of pride 
		and sharp dealing. I'm sorry that I 
		turned my back on you, Lord. Please 
		forgive me, and help us, Lord, and I 
		swear I'll mend my ways... For the 
		sake of my family... For Tommy's 
		sake, and Delmar's, and Pete's...

	The rumble is building.

				EVERETT
		...Let me see my daughters again. 
		Please, Lord, help us... Please help 
		us...

	The rumble erupts into a deafening roar.

	A wall of water is crashing through the hollow.

	It engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is 
	ripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their 
	feet and all is noise and confusion.

	UNDERWATER

	A silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural 
	slow motion.

	Suspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family 
	portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a 
	frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically 
	paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it.

	FURTHER DOWNHILL

	The churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly 
	created river, fast-moving but no longer violent.

	After a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is 
	broken by the up-bob of a pine coffin.

	The coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett 
	pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking 
	his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish 
	freeing himself from the rope round his wrists.

	Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air.

	The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. 
	Dazed, they look around.

	The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or 
	treetop poking out of the newly formed river. All is quiet 
	except for the gurgle of water.

				DELMAR
		A miracle! It was a miracle!

				EVERETT
		Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I 
		told you they was gonna flood this 
		valley.

				DELMAR
		That ain't it!

				PETE
		We prayed to God and he pitied us!

				EVERETT
		It just never fails; once again you 
		two hayseeds are showin' how much 
		you want for innalect. There's a 
		perfectly scientific explanation for 
		what just happened -

				PETE
		That ain't the tune you were singin' 
		back there at the gallows!

				EVERETT
		Well any human being will cast about 
		in a moment of stress. No, the fact 
		is, they're flooding this valley so 
		they can hydro-electric up the whole 
		durned state...

	Everett waxes smug:

				EVERETT
		Yessir, the South is gonna change.  
		Everything's gonna be put on 
		electricity and run on a payin' basis. 
		Out with the old spiritual mumbo-
		jumbo, the superstitions and the 
		backward ways. We're gonna see a 
		brave new world where they run 
		everyone a wire and hook us all up 
		to a grid. Yessir, a veritable age 
		of reason - like the one they had in 
		France - and not a moment too soon...

	His voice trails off as he notices something.

	A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its 
	eaves. A cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring 
	at Everett, who returns the stare.

	He shakes off the vision and clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Not a moment too soon. Say, there's 
		Tommy!

	Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a 
	half-submerged piece of furniture.

				EVERETT
		What you ridin' there, Tommy?

	The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current 
	and, to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place 
	like a hamster on a wheel. As the chest exposes its ribbed 
	upper half:

				TOMMY
		Rolltop desk...

	STREET

	Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals 
	behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk.

				EVERETT
		All's well that ends well, as the 
		poet says.

				PENNY
		That's right, honey.

				EVERETT
		But I don't mind telling you, I'm 
		awful pleased my adventuring days is 
		at an end...

	He fumbles in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		...Time for this old boy to enjoy 
		some repose.

				PENNY
		That's good, honey.

				EVERETT
		And you were right about that ring. 
		Any other weddin' band would not do. 
		But this-here was foreordained, honey; 
		fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya 
		have to have confidence -

	He is slipping it onto her hand.

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		- in the gods - Huh?

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		Not your...

				PENNY
		That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

				EVERETT
		You said it was in the rolltop desk!

				PENNY
		I said I thought it was in the rolltop 
		desk.

				EVERETT
		You said -

				PENNY
		Or, it might a been under the 
		mattress.

				EVERETT
		You -

				PENNY
		Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

	Everett shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		Well, I'm sorry honey -

				PENNY
		Well, we need that ring.

				EVERETT
		Well now honey, that ring is at the 
		bottom of a pretty durned big lake.

				PENNY
		Uh-huh.

				EVERETT
		A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.

				PENNY
		I don't care if it's ninety thousand.

				EVERETT
		Yes, but honey -

				PENNY
		That wasn't my doing...

	Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two 
	are pulling forward out of frame.

				EVERETT
		Course not, honey, but...

	We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, 
	still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we 
	can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal.

	The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of 
	string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and 
	Everett, off:

				PENNY
		I counted to three, honey.

				EVERETT
		Well sure, honey, but...

	We reach the end of the piece of string; it is wrapped around 
	the waist of the toddler, who lingers in frame. She gazes 
	down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open 
	field.

				EVERETT
		...finding one little ring in the 
		middle of all that water...

	His voice, and that of the singing girls, recedes.

				EVERETT
		...that is one hell of a heroic 
		task...

	The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of 
	frame.

	A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The rhythmic 
	clack is from the hand-pumped flatcar.

	The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing 
	harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.

	THE END
"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"

					  By

			   Ethan Coen and Joel Coen

	BLACK

	In black, we hear a chain-gang chant, many voices together, 
	spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock. A 
	title burns in:

	O muse! 
	Sing in me, and through me tell the story 
	Of that man skilled in all the ways of contending... 
	A wanderer, harried for years on end...

	On the sound of an impact we cut to:

	A PICK

	splitting a rock.

	As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at 
	work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, 
	chained together, working under a brutal midday sun.

	It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road 
	stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
	patrol the line.

	The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.

	We slowly fade out, returning to

	BLACK

	The last of the voices fades.

	After a long beat we hear the guitar introduction to Harry 
	McClintock's 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain.'

	A WHEAT FIELD

	A road cuts across the middle background. Noonday sun beats 
	down.

	We hear the distant picks and shovels of men at work and 
	see, rising above ground level, the occasional upraised pick 
	and spade heaving dirt. Men are digging a ditch alongside 
	the road.

	After a long beat, three men pop up in the wheat field in 
	the middle foreground. They wear faded stripes and grey duck-
	billed caps. They scurry abreast toward the camera, throwing 
	an occasional glance back at the ditch-diggers. A clanking 
	sound accompanies their run. Oddly, the wheat between them 
	sweeps down as they run. After a brief sprint they drop back 
	down into the wheat.

	In the background a man enters frame left, strolling along 
	the road, wearing a khaki uniform and sunglasses, a shotgun 
	resting against one shoulder. He glances idly down into the 
	ditch and strolls on out of frame right.

	The three men rise back up from the wheat and, clanking, 
	resume their sprint.

	THREE PAIRS OF EYES

	They are topped by three cap bills, and peer out from behind 
	a blind of greenery. We hear distant whistling.

	The men are looking at a weathered barn. A young boy, 
	whistling, is heading down the road that leads away from the 
	barn, jiggling the traces of the old plough horse that leads 
	him. He turns a corner and is gone.

	BARNYARD

	The three clanking men (we can now see their leg irons) are 
	awkwardly chasing a chicken around the yard. The squawking 
	yardbird doesn't need to move much to elude the three bunched 
	men.

	COUNTRY LANE

	It curves in a gentle S into the background. It is sun-
	dappled, pretty.

	We hear clanking footsteps approaching at a trot.

	The three men enter in the foreground and trot on down the 
	lane. The leftmost has a flapping chicken tucked under one 
	arm.

	AFTERNOON CAMPFIRE

	The three men sit in a side-by-side arc around a dying fire, 
	one of them contentedly picking his teeth with a small chicken 
	bone, another wiping grease off his chin with a sleeve, the 
	third idly poking at the fire with a spit.

	Each of them, still bound by chains, clinks as he moves.

	One of them abruptly cocks his head, listening.

	The others notice his attitude and also freeze, listening.

	We hear the distant baying of hounds.

	ROLLING HILLS

	From high on a ridge we see the three chained men running 
	toward us.

	In addition to their clanks we hear a distant chugging sound.

	TRACKING

	Laterally with the clanking, running feet.

	The chugging sound is very loud.

	RUNNING

	Next to a freight train. A boxcar door is open.

	INSIDE THE BOXCAR

	The lead convict hooks an elbow in and starts hauling himself 
	up, his two clanking friends keeping pace outside.

	Six hobos sit in the boxcar, lounging against sacks of 
	O'Daniel's Flour. They impassively watch the convict clamber 
	in as his two confederates run to keep up.

	The convict hauls himself to his feet. In spite of his stubble 
	he has carefully tended hair and a pencil mustache. He is 
	Everett.

	As he dusts himself off:

				EVERETT
		Say, uh, any a you boys smithies?

	The hobos stare.

	Everett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second 
	convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third 
	convict still keeping pace outside.

				EVERETT
		Or, if not smithies per se, were you 
		otherwise trained in the metallurgic 
		arts before straitened circumstances 
		forced you into a life of aimless 
		wanderin'?

	The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and 
	disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately 
	after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in 
	turn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the 
	open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves 
	on the boxcar floorboards.

	The hobos impassively watch.

	OUTSIDE

	The three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment.

	Squush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom.

	They shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the 
	muck and watch the train recede.

	Its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds.

				EVERETT
		Jesus - can't I count on you people?

	The second con is Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Sorry, Everett.

	Everett looks desperately about.

				EVERETT
		All right - if we take off through 
		that bayou-

	The third con, Pete, bald but also with beard stubble, angrily 
	cuts in.

				PETE
		Wait a minute! Who elected you leader 
		a this outfit?

				EVERETT
		Well, Pete, I just figured it should 
		be the one with capacity for abstract 
		thought. But if that ain't the 
		consensus view, hell, let's put her 
		to a vote!

				PETE
		Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!

				EVERETT
		Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!

	Both men look interrogatively to Delmar.

	He looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably.

				DELMAR
		Okay - I'm with you fellas.

	Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen.

	The baying of hounds is louder now, but through it we hear a 
	distant scrape of metal against metal, like the workings of 
	a rusty pump. The men turn in unison to look up the track.

	A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward 
	them.

	As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. 
	An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw 
	handle.

	The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to 
	show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs.

	The flatcar draws even and slows.

				EVERETT
		Mind if we join you, ol' timer?

				OLD MAN
		Join me, my sons.

	The three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping.

	The three men exchange glances; Delmar waves a clanking hand 
	before the old man's milky eyes. No reaction.

				DELMAR
		You work for the railroad, grandpa?

				OLD MAN
		I work for no man.

				PETE
		Got a name, do ya?

				OLD MAN
		I have no name.

				EVERETT
		Well, that right there may be why 
		you've had difficulty finding gainful 
		employment. Ya see, in the mart of 
		competitive commerce, the-

				OLD MAN
		You seek a great fortune, you three 
		who are now in chains...

	The men fall silent.

				OLD MAN
		And you will find a fortune - though 
		it will not be the fortune you seek...

	The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the 
	blind prophet.

				OLD MAN
		...But first, first you must travel 
		a long and difficult road - a road 
		fraught with peril, uh-huh, and 
		pregnant with adventure. You shall 
		see things wonderful to tell. You 
		shall see a cow on the roof of a 
		cottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many 
		startlements...

	The cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the 
	track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame.

				OLD MAN
		...I cannot say how long this road 
		shall be. But fear not the obstacles 
		in your path, for Fate has vouchsafed 
		your reward.  And though the road 
		may wind, and yea, your hearts grow 
		weary, still shall ye foller the 
		way, even unto your salvation.

	The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate 
	his words.

	Loud and sudden:

				OLD MAN
		IZZAT CLEAR?

	The men start, then mumble polite acknowledgement.

	The railroad tracks wind to the setting sun. Reek-a reek-a 
	reek-a - the flatcar rolls, in wide shot, toward the golden 
	horizon.

								FADE OUT

	DAY

	A hot dusty road leading up to a lone farmhouse.

	The three men walk, clanking and abreast.

				DELMAR
		How'd he know about the treasure?

				EVERETT
		Don't know, Delmar-though the blind 
		are reputed to possess sensitivities 
		compensatin' for their lack of sight, 
		even to the point of developing para-
		normal psychic powers. Now clearly, 
		seein' the future would fall neatly 
		into that ka-taggery. It's not so 
		surprising, then, if an organism 
		deprived of earthly vision-

				PETE
		He said we wouldn't get it! He said 
		we wouldn't get the treasure we seek!

	Everett grows testy:

				EVERETT
		Well what does he know - he's an 
		ignorant old man! Jesus, Pete, I'm 
		telling you I buried it myself, and 
		if your cousin still runs this-here 
		horse farm and has a forge and some 
		shoein' impediments to restore our 
		liberty of movement-

	Bang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men.

				CHILD'S VOICE
		Hold it rah chair!

	The front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front 
	porch and a dark screen door.

	The screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the 
	porch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost 
	bigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years 
	old, wears tattered overalls.

				CHILD
		You men from the bank?

				PETE
		You Wash's boy?

				CHILD
		Yassir! And Daddy tolt me I'm to 
		shoot whosoever from the bank!

	He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands.

				DELMAR
		Well, we ain't from no bank, young 
		feller.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I'm also suppose to shoot 
		folks servin' papers!

				DELMAR
		Well we ain't got no papers.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I nicked the census man!

				DELMAR
		There's a good boy. Is your daddy 
		about?

	THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

	Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted 
	bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm 
	implements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly 
	at a stick.

	He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, 
	then returns to his whittling.

				WASH
		'Lo, Pete. Hooor yer friends?

				EVERETT
		Pleased to make your acquaintance, 
		Mister Hogwallop. M'name's Ulysses 
		Everett McGill.

				DELMAR
		'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.

				PETE
		How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, 
		thirteen year'n?

	Still looking sourly at his whittling:

				WASH
		You've grown chatty.

	He tosses the stick aside and sighs.

				WASH
		I expect you'll want them chains 
		knocked off.

	THE HOGWALLOP KITCHEN

	The four men and little boy sit around the kitchen table 
	eating stew. A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair 
	brings him to table height. The cons are now rid of their 
	chains and are dressed in ill-fitting farmer's wear.

	WASH

	They foreclosed on Cousin Vester. He hanged himself a year 
	come May.

				PETE
		And Uncle Ratliff?

				WASH
		The anthrax took most of his cows. 
		The rest don't milk, and he lost a 
		boy to mumps.

				PETE
		Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

	Wash glances at the little boy.

				WASH
		Couldn't say. Mrs. Hogwallop up and 
		R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

				EVERETT
		Mm. Must've been lookin' for answers.

				WASH
		Possibly. Good riddance, far as I'm 
		concerned...

	The three men slurp their stew.

				WASH
		I do miss her cookin' though.

				DELMAR
		This stew's awful good.

				WASH
		Think so?

	He sniffs dubiously at his spoon.

				WASH
		I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday; 
		'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

	LIVING ROOM

	Later. The four men sit about listening to a big box radio. 
	Wash is whittling once again; Everett dips his comb into a 
	pomade jar and carefully works on his hair; Pete is digging 
	around with a toothpick; Delmar dreamily waves one hand in 
	time to the music.

	The music ends.

				ANNOUNCER
		Well, that's the last number for 
		tonight's 'Pass the Biscuits Pappy 
		O'Daniel Flour Hour.' This is Pappy 
		O'Daniel, hopin' you folks been 
		enjoyin' that good old-timey music, 
		and remember, when you're fixin' to 
		fry up some flapjacks or bake a mess 
		a biscuits, use cool clear water and 
		good pure Pappy O'Daniel flour for 
		that 'Pass the Biscuits, Pappy' 
		flavor.  So tune in next week folks, 
		and till then whyncha turn to your 
		better half and sing along with Pappy: 
		'You are my sunshine, my only 
		sunshine...'

	Everett clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Well, guess I'll be turning in...

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

				EVERETT
		Say, Cousin Wash, I guess it'd be 
		the acme of foolishness to inquire 
		if you had a hairnet.

				WASH
		Got a bunch in yon byurra.  Mrs. 
		Hogwallop's, matter of fact.  
		Hepyaseff; I won't be needin' 'em.

	THE THREE MEN

	Sleeping in a hayloft. Everett wears a hairnet over his 
	painstakingly arranged hair.

	Pete snores on the inhale. Delmar whistles on the exhale.

	A spotlight plays over the hayloft ceiling and a voice booms:

				BULLHORN VOICE
		All right boys, itsy authorities.

	The three men rouse themselves.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		We gotcha surrounded. Just come on 
		out grabbin' air!

	Everett shrugs his shoulders and peeks down into the barnyard.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	From high we see a foreshortened lawman holding a bullhorn 
	surrounded by armed deputies.

	Next to the man with the bullhorn, a tin-starred sheriff 
	watches impassively through mirrored sunglasses, a bloodhound 
	drooling at his side.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		And don't try nothin' fancy - your 
		sitchy-ation is purt nigh hopeless.

				DELMAR
		What inna Sam Hill...?

				EVERETT
		Pete's cousin turned us in for the 
		bounty!

				PETE
		The hell you say! Wash is kin!

	An unamplified voice echoes up from the yard:

				VOICE
		Sorry Pete! I know we're kin! But 
		they got this Depression on, and I 
		gotta do fer me and mine!

	Pete screams down from the hayport:

				PETE
		I'M GONNA KILL YOU, JUDAS ISCARIOT 
		HOGWALLOP! YOU MIS'ABLE HOSS-EATIN' 
		SONOFABITCH! YOU-

	RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT- Everett pulls Pete down as a tommy gun spits 
	lead into the hayloft.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	Pete is enraged:

				PETE
		Damn his eyes! Pa always said never 
		trust a Hogwallop-COME'N GET US, 
		COPPERS!

				BULLHORN VOICE
		So be it! You boys're leavin' us no 
		choice but to smoke you out.

				EVERETT
		Oh no! Lord have mercy!

	Men approach the barn with torches.

				DELMAR
		What do we do now, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Fire! I hate fire!

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY TIN-WEARIN' MOTHERLESS
		BARNBURNIN' COCKROACHES-

	Everett cuts in, his voice breaking:

				EVERETT
		NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD 
		OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK 
		THIS THING OUT!

				DELMAR
		Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

	The hayloft is filling with smoke. Flames lick downstairs.

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN 
		SKUNKS-

				EVERETT
		Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak 
		with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH 
		THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!

	Pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized 
	congregation.

	It lands harmlessly in some scattered straw.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		You choose it, boys - the prison 
		farm or the pearly gates!

	The straw curls, lights, and the fire scuttles over to a 
	parked Black Maria.

	With a loud airy WHOOOF! the undercarriage of the police van 
	pops into flame.

	The man with the bullhorn sees it.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Holy Saint Christopher - OUTA THAT 
		VEHICLE, CHAMP, SHE'S LICKIN' FAR!

	Tommy guns are stored in the back of the van. The drum of 
	one starts spinning.

	Flames lick up the outside of the van as - chinka-chinka-
	chinka - bullet holes walk across the body.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Take cover, boys, THAT AIN'T POPCORN!

	Yelling men scurry away.

	The vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many 
	tommy guns now firing inside. Tires pop, hiss and settle; 
	doors pop open; glass shatters.

				VOICES
		Who's that?

	An oncoming car is bouncing crazily across the yard, horn 
	blaring. Deputies leap out of its path.

	The car shoots past the chattering van which still bucks and 
	bounces on its shocks, its interior strobing and flashing as 
	if filled with trapped lightning.

	The speeding car heads directly for the flaming barn door 
	and crashes through in a shower of sparks.

	The car brakes inside the barn and the driver's door flies 
	open. The little Hogwallop boy yells over the roar of the 
	flames:

				BOY
		Come on, boys! I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-
		T!

	Pete, Everett and Delmar pile in.

				DELMAR
		You should be in bed, little fella.

	The doors slam shut and the boy grinds into gear. He has 
	wood blocks strapped to his feet so that he can reach 
	accelerator, brake and clutch. He sits on a Sears Roebuck 
	catalogue to give him a view over the dash.

				BOY
		You ain't the boss a me!

	The car speeds for the far wall, sheeted in flame, and bursts 
	through.

	COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	The little Hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the 
	middle of the empty road. His walk is unsteady, the wood 
	blocks still strapped to his feet.

	He turns to face us and hollers:

				BOY
		You candy-butted car-thievin' so's 
		'n so's! I curse yer names!

	Pete enters in the foreground and throws a dirt clod at the 
	boy. It lands shy as Pete yells:

				PETE
		Go back home'n mind yer pa!

	We pan Pete over to the shoulder where the car is stopped, 
	its hood propped open. Everett and Delmar are looking at the 
	engine.

				PETE
		What's the damn problem?

	DRYGOODS STORE

	The proprietor is a bespectacled middle-aged man wearing 
	sleeve garters and a visor. Behind him are stacked, among 
	other necessaries, sacks of O'Daniel Flour. He pushes a small 
	tin across the counter.

				PROPRIETOR
		I can get the part from Bristol; 
		it'll take two weeks. Here's your 
		pomade.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		Two weeks! That don't do me no good!

				PROPRIETOR
		Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

	Everett picks up the tin.

				EVERETT
		Hold on there - I don't want this 
		pomade, I want Dapper Dan.

				PROPRIETOR
		I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry 
		Fop.

				EVERETT
		No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I 
		use Dapper Dan!

				PROPRIETOR
		Watch your language, young fellow, 
		this is a public market. Now, if you 
		want Dapper Dan I can order it for 
		you, have it in a couple of weeks.

				EVERETT
		Well, ain't this place a geographical 
		oddity-two weeks from everywhere!  
		Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!

	PETE AND DELMAR

	On a wooded hillside. They sit at a twig fire, roasting a 
	small creature on a spit.

				EVERETT (O.S.)
		It didn't look like a one-horse 
		town...

	He stalks into frame and plops disgustedly down by the fire.

				EVERETT
		...but try getting a decent hair 
		jelly.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

				EVERETT
		And no transmission belt for two 
		weeks neither.

				PETE
		Huh?! They dam that river on the 
		21st.  Today's the 17th!

				EVERETT
		Don't I know it.

				PETE
		We got but four days to get to that 
		treasure! After that, it'll be at 
		the bottom of a lake!

	He grimly shakes his head.

				PETE
		We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

	Everett has taken out a can of near-empty Dapper Dan. He 
	scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his 
	hair.

	We hear distant singing - one lone tenor voice.

				EVERETT
		Well, you're right there, but the 
		ol' tactician's already got a plan-

	Everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to 
	Pete.

				EVERETT
		-for the transportation, that is; I 
		don't know how I'm gonna keep my 
		coiffure in order.

	Pete looks at the watch, puzzled.

				PETE
		How's this a plan? How're we gonna 
		get a car?

				EVERETT
		Sell that. I figured it could only 
		have painful associations for Wash.

	Pete pops the front and reads the inscription.

				PETE
		To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop.  
		From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie-
		dellis.

				EVERETT
		It was in his bureau.

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

	Delmar whistles appreciatively.

				DELMAR
		You got light fingers, Everett. 
		Gopher?

				PETE
		You mis'able little sneak thief...

	He lurches threateningly to his feet.

				PETE
		You stole from my kin!

	Everett scrambles up.

				EVERETT
		Who was fixing to betray us!

				PETE
		You didn't know that at the time!

				EVERETT
		So I borrowed it till I did know!

				PETE
		That don't make no sense!

				EVERETT
		Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in 
		the chambers of the human heart. 
		What the hell's that singing?

	We can make out the words now, sung by the lone tenor.

				VOICE
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you wanna go down...

	People in white robes are drifting down the hill, through 
	the woods behind the campsite. They join in with the lead 
	voice:

				VOICES
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, down to 
		the river to pray...

	Delmar gazes wonderingly at the white-robed figures as he 
	answers Everett:

				DELMAR
		Appears to be... some kinda... con-
		gur-gation. Care for some gopher?

	Everett too watches the white-robed people following in the 
	wake of the tenor. He answers absently:

				EVERETT
		No, thank you Delmar - a third of a 
		gopher would only rouse my appetite 
		without beddin' her back down.

	There are more and more white robes drifting through the 
	woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men.

				DELMAR
		You can have the whole thing - me'n 
		Pete already had one...

	There is an endless stream now, drifting through the 
	foreground, the background, the campsite itself.

				VOICES
		Oh, sisters, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you want to go down...

				DELMAR
		We ran acrost a gopher village...

	The drifting worshipers wear beatific expressions. One only, 
	a middle-aged woman, notices the three convicts around whom 
	the rest of the flock blindly drifts. She calls to them:

				WOMAN
		Come with us, brothers! Join us and 
		be saved!

	THE RIVER

	White robes stream down the hill, out of the woods, and down 
	the riverbank. The voices swell in a great chorus:

				VOICES
		We went down to the river one day, 
		Studying about that good old way, 
		And who shall wear that robe and 
		crown, Oh Lord, show us the way...

	We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground. 
	He stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man 
	back-down into the water. Behind him a line of robed singers 
	lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods.

	Pete, Delmar and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down 
	at the river. White-robed people continue to drift past them.

				EVERETT
		I guess hard times flush the chumps.  
		Everybody's lookin' for answers, and 
		there's always-

	Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line.

				EVERETT
		Where the hell's he goin'?

	Delmar has reached the minister and holds his nose as the 
	minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water.

				PETE
		Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's 
		been saved!

				EVERETT
		Pete, don't be ignorant-

	Delmar is slogging back through the water.

				DELMAR
		Well that's it boys, I been redeemed!  
		The preacher warshed away all my 
		sins and transgressions. It's the 
		straight-and-narrow from here on out 
		and heaven everlasting's my reward!

				EVERETT
		Delmar what the hell are you talking 
		about? - We got bigger fish to fry-

				DELMAR
		Preacher said my sins are warshed 
		away, including that Piggly Wiggly I 
		knocked over in Yazoo!

				EVERETT
		I thought you said you were innocent 
		a those charges.

				DELMAR
		Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to 
		say that that sin's been warshed 
		away too!  Neither God nor man's got 
		nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, 
		the water's fine!

	LATER

	The smoldering twig fire. A bloodhound on a leash circles 
	into frame, its tail fiercely wagging.

	We follow it as, nose to the ground and straining against 
	its leash, it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan 
	pomade.

				A VOICE
		All tight, boys! We got the scent!

	A CAR

	Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile. 
	Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both 
	dripping wet.

	Pete is sullen:

				PETE
		The preacher said it absolved us.

				EVERETT
		For him, not for the law! I'm 
		surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave 
		you credit for more brains than 
		Delmar.

				DELMAR
		But there were witnesses, saw us 
		redeemed!

				EVERETT
		That's not the issue, Delmar. Even 
		if it did put you square with the 
		Lord, the State of Mississippi is 
		more hardnosed.

				DELMAR
		You should a joined us, Everett. It 
		couldn't a hurt none.

				PETE
		Hell, at least it woulda washed away 
		the stink of that pomade.

				EVERETT
		Join you two ignorant fools in a 
		ridiculous superstition? Thank you 
		anyway.  And I like the smell of my 
		hair treatment - the pleasing odor 
		is half the point.

	He shakes his head and laughs.

				EVERETT
		Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a 
		bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're 
		my cross to bear-

				DELMAR
		Pull over, Everett - let's give that 
		colored boy a lift.

	A thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands 
	on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. He 
	grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and 
	trots up to the open window.

				HITCHHIKER
		You folks goin' through Tishamingo?

	Delmar pushes open the back door.

				DELMAR
		Sure, hop in.

	Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls 
	out.

				EVERETT
		How ya doin', boy? Name's Everett, 
		and these two soggy sonsabitches are 
		Pete and Delmar. Keep your fingers 
		away from Pete's mouth-he ain't had 
		nothin' to eat for the last thirteen 
		years but prison food, gopher, and a 
		little greasy horse.

				HITCHHIKER
		Thank you fuh the lif', suh. M'names 
		Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

	Delmar is genuinely friendly:

				DELMAR
		How ya doin', Tommy. I haven't seen 
		a house in miles. What're you doin' 
		out in the middle of nowhere?

	Tommy is matter-of-fact:

				TOMMY
		I had to be at that crossroads las' 
		midnight to sell mah soul to the 
		devil.

				EVERETT
		Well ain't it a small world, 
		spiritually speakin'! Pete and Delmar 
		just been baptized and saved! I guess 
		I'm the only one here who remains 
		unaffiliated!

				DELMAR
		This ain't no laughin' matter, 
		Everett.

				EVERETT
		What'd the devil give you for your 
		soul, Tommy?

				TOMMY
		He taught me to play this guitar 
		real good.

	Delmar is horrified:

				DELMAR
		Oh, son! For that you traded your 
		everlastin' soul?!

	Tommy shrugs.

				TOMMY
		I wudden usin' it.

				PETE
		I always wondered-what's the devil 
		look like?

				EVERETT
		Well, of course there's all manner 
		of lesser imps'n demons, Pete, but 
		the Great Satan hisself is red and 
		scaly with a bifurcated tail and 
		carries a hayfork.

				TOMMY
		Oh no! No suh! He's white-white as 
		you folks, with mirrors for eyes an'  
		a big hollow voice an' allus travels 
		with a mean old hound.

				PETE
		And he told you to go to Tishamingo?

				TOMMY
		No suh, that was mah idea. I heard 
		they's a man there pays folks money 
		to sing into a can. They say he pays 
		extra effen you play real good.

	Everett's eyes narrow as he studies the man in the rearview.

				EVERETT
		How much does he pay?

	TISHAMINGO

	The car is pulling into the parking lot of a single-story 
	cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a 
	handpainted sign:

	WEZY 
	LISTENING AIN'T NEVER BEEN 
	SO EASY NOR 
	SO FINE

	As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders.

				EVERETT
		All right boys, just follow my lead.

	INSIDE

	Everett strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears 
	dark glasses and holds a white cane.

				EVERETT
		Who's the honcho around here?

				MAN
		I am. Hur you?

				EVERETT
		Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers 
		and these here are the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi-
		Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. 
		We hear you pay good money to sing 
		into a can.

				MAN
		Well that all depends. You boys do 
		Negro songs?

	Everett grimaces, thinking.

				EVERETT
		Sir, we are Negroes. All except our 
		a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, 
		the fella that plays the gui-tar.

				MAN
		Well, I don't record Negro songs. 
		I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey 
		material.  Why, people just can't 
		get enough of it since we started 
		broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel 
		Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' 
		by, but-

				EVERETT
		Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been 
		steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, 
		you're silly with it, aintcha boys?

				PETE
		That's right!

				DELMAR
		That's right! We ain't really Negroes!

				PETE
		All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!

	THE STUDIO

	The three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, 
	who plays his guitar into a can microphone. They are 
	performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant 
	Sorrow'.

	When they finish Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back.

				EVERETT
		Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you 
		did sell your soul to the devil!

				MAN
		Boys, that was some mighty fine 
		pickin' and singin'. You just sign 
		these papers and I'll give you ten 
		dollars apiece.

				EVERETT
		Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll 
		have to scratch Xes - only four of 
		us can write.

	THE LOT

	A caravan of two oversize cars is pulling into the lot just 
	as Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station 
	door, whooping it up.

	A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by 
	suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly is 
	getting out of the first car. His face is familiar from 
	countless sacks of Pass the Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour.

	Delmar waves a fistful of money at him.

				DELMAR
		Hey mister! I don't mean to be tellin' 
		tales out a school, but there's a 
		man in there hands out ten dollars 
		to anyone sings into his can!

				PAPPY
		I'm not here to make a record, ya 
		dumb cracker, they broadcast me out 
		on the radio.

	A big shambling man of about thirty has followed him out of 
	the car. He has the sloping shoulders, the pasty skin, and 
	the aimlessly bobbing head of an intellectual flyweight.

				JUNIOR
		That's Governor Menelaus 'Pass the 
		Biscuits, Pappy' O'Daniel, and he'd 
		sure 'preciate it if you ate his 
		farina and voted him a second term.

	Two other members of the retinue, older men whose girth rivals 
	the governor's, are Eckard and Spivey.

				ECKARD
		Finest governor we've ever had in 
		M'sippi.

				SPIVEY
		In any state.

				ECKARD
		Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; 
		I was makin' the larger point.

	As Pappy brushes by them, Junior wheedles:

				JUNIOR
		Aintcha gonna press the flesh, Pappy, 
		do a little politickin'?

	Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'll press your flesh, you dimwitted 
		sonofabitch - you don't tell your 
		pappy how to cawt the elect 'rate!

	Pappy waves his hat at the radio building as singers in faux 
	hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get 
	out of the second car.

				PAPPY
		We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we 
		mass communicatin'!

				ECKARD
		Oh, yes, assa parful new force.

				SPIVEY
		Mm-mm.

	The men head for the station, with Junior lagging.

				PAPPY
		Shake a leg, Junior! Thank God your 
		mama died givin' birth-if she'd a 
		seen ya she'd a died of shame...

	A CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	Tommy sits in the background, playing and singing a slow 
	blues. The three convicts, holding coffee cups, gaze into 
	the fire.

	Over the dreamy song:

				DELMAR
		Why don't we bed down out here 
		tonight?

				PETE
		Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

				EVERETT
		Suits me...

	He stretches out.

				EVERETT
		Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but 
		feather beds'n silk sheets.

	Pete swishes his coffee as he stares into the blaze.

				PETE
		A million dollars.

				EVERETT
		Million point two.

				DELMAR
		Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

				EVERETT
		Four hundred, Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Izzat right?

				EVERETT
		What're you gonna do with your share 
		of the treasure, Pete?

				PETE
		Go out west somewhere, open a fine 
		restaurant. I'm gonna be the maider 
		dee.  Greet all the swells, go to 
		work ever' day in a bowtie and tuxedo, 
		an' all the staff'll all say Yassir 
		and Nawsir and in a Jiffy Pete...

	He gives his coffee a thoughtful swish and murmurs:

				PETE
		An' all my meals for free...

				EVERETT
		What about you, Delmar? What're you 
		gonna do with your share a that dough?

				DELMAR
		Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns 
		down at the Indianola Savings and 
		Loan and slap that cash down on the 
		barrelhead and buy back the family 
		farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man 
		if you ain't got land.

				PETE
		What about you, Everett? What'd you 
		have in mind when you stoled it in 
		the first place?

				EVERETT
		Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still 
		don't, really.

				PETE
		Well that hardly sounds like you...

	A distant Voice:

				VOICE
		All right, boys, itsy authorities!

	The three men tense up. Tommy stops singing.

				VOICE
		Your sitchy-ation is purt nigh 
		hopeless!

	Pete shovels dirt onto the fire as Delmar and Everett scramble 
	to peek over a low ridge.

	Their point-of-view shows a lone barn with their car parked 
	to one side. Various police vehicles have pulled up facing 
	the barn, and armed men, their backs to us, train guns on 
	it, some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars.

				EVERETT
		Damn! They found our car!

	The man with the bullhorn continues, directing his comments 
	at the distant barn:

				MAN
		We ain't got the time-and nary 
		inclination-to gentle you boys no 
		further!

	The three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands 
	impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a 
	leash against which a bloodhound strains.

				MAN
		It's either the penal farm or the 
		fires of damnation-makes no nevermind 
		to me!

	The sheriff makes a signal to a man holding a torch, who 
	skitters up to the barn and lights it.

				DELMAR
		Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

				EVERETT
		I left my pomade in that car! Maybe 
		I can creep up!

				DELMAR
		Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R-
		U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!

				EVERETT
		Where's Tommy?

				PETE
		Already lit out, scared out of his 
		wits. Let's go!

	DAYTIME ROAD

	The three men shuffle down the dusty road.

				PETE
		The hell it ain't square one! Ain't 
		no one gonna pick up three filthy 
		unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em 
		a know-it-all that can't keep his 
		trap shut!

				EVERETT
		Pete, the personal rancor reflected 
		in that remark I don't intend to 
		dignify with comment, but I would 
		like to address your general attitude 
		of hopeless negativism. Consider the 
		lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- 
		take a look at Delmar here as your 
		paradigm a hope.

				DELMAR
		Yeah, look at me.

				EVERETT
		Now you may call it an unreasoning 
		optimism. You may call it obtuse. 
		But the plain fact is we still have... 
		close to... close to...

	He loses his drift as all three men turn, reacting to the 
	sound of an approaching speeding car.

				EVERETT
		...close to... three days... before 
		they dam that river...

	The car comes into view cornering on two wheels. It crashes 
	back onto all four and, as it speeds along, dollar bills 
	snap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the 
	three men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb. It screeches to 
	a halt.

	The driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike 
	face, leans over to call through the passenger window.

				DRIVER
		Is this the road to Itta Bena?

				PETE
		Uh... Itta Bena...

	Delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air and 
	looks at it wonderingly. He holds it stretched between two 
	hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an 
	appraising pop.

				EVERETT
		Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...

				PETE
		Isn't it, uh...

	Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at 
	the wafting currency, and yanks another fluttering bill out 
	of the air.

				EVERETT
		I'm thinkin' it's uh, you could take 
		this road to, uh...

	There is the sound of a distant siren.

	The driver, still patiently leaning over to hear out the two 
	brainwrackers, shoots a quick look in his rearview mirror.

				PETE
		...Nah, that ain't right... I'm 
		thinkin' of...

				EVERETT
		...I believe, unless I'm very much 
		mistaken - see, we've been away for 
		several years, uh...

	The driver pushes open the passenger door.

				DRIVER
		Hop on in while you give it a think.

	The three men climb in and the car squeals out.

	INT. CAR

	The driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the 
	sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat.

				DRIVER
		Any a you boys know your way around 
		a Walther PPK?

				DELMAR
		Well now, that's where we cain't 
		help ya. I don't believe it's in 
		Mississippi.

	The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his 
	passengers. Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering 
	inside the car:

				DELMAR
		Friend, some of your folding money 
		has come unstowed.

				DRIVER
		Just stuff it down that sack there. 
		You boys aren't badmen, I take it?

				DELMAR
		Well, funny you should ask-I was 
		bad, till yesterday, but me'n Pete 
		here been saved. My name's Delmar, 
		and that there's Everett.

				DRIVER
		George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

	He opens his door and steps onto the running board, giving 
	Everett a casual:

				NELSON
		Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?

	Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully 
	outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped 
	on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other.

				NELSON
		Hand up that Thompson, Jack.

	Delmar gropes in the footwell.

				DELMAR
		Say, what line of work are you in, 
		George?

	EXT. CAR

	Nelson sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car.

				NELSON
		COME AND GET ME, COPPERS! YOU 
		FLATFOOTED LAMEBRAINED SOFT-ASSED 
		SONOFABITCHES! NO ONE CAN CATCH ME!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON! I'M BIGGER THAN 
		ANY JOHN LAW EVER LIVED! HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! I'M TEN-AND-A-HALF FEET TALL AND 
		AIN'T YET FULLY GROWED!

	Nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him, returning 
	fire. He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the 
	roadside and murmurs:

				NELSON
		...cows...

	He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop.

				NELSON
		I hate cows worse than coppers!

	He lets loose a spray. One of the cows drops and the rest 
	stampede toward the road.

				DELMAR
		Aww, George, not the livestock.

	Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing:

				NELSON
		HA-HA! COME ON YOU MISERABLE SALARIED 
		SONSABITCHES! COME AND GET ME!

	In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police 
	pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. 
	The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling 
	wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes.

	SMALL TOWN

	The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through 
	light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means 
	of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits.

	The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the 
	three convicts emerge to follow him.

				NELSON
		COME ON BOYS! WE'RE GOIN' FOR THE 
		RECORD-THREE BANKS IN TWO HOURS!

	Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through 
	the door of the bank, followed by the three men.

	He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table.

				NELSON
		OKAY FOLKS! HOLD THE APPLAUSE AND 
		DROP YER DRAWERS - I'M GEORGE NELSON 
		AND I'M HERE TO SACK THE CITY A ITTA 
		BENA!

	He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young 
	woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on 
	the lips.

	Delmar nudges Everett.

				DELMAR
		He's a live wire though, ain't he?

				NELSON
		Thanky dear! All the money in the 
		bag, and you can tell your grandkids 
		you were done by the best! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	He winks at the three men who obediently wait.

				NELSON
		It's a kick and a quarter, ain't it 
		boys?

	Distant sirens again.

				EVERETT
		Pardon me, George, but have you got 
		a plan for gettin' outa here?

				NELSON
		Sure boys, here's m'plan!

	He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of 
	dynamite.

				NELSON
		They ain't never seen ordnance like 
		this!  WELL, THANK YOU, FOLKS, AND 
		REMEMBER: JESUS SAVES, BUT GEORGE 
		NELSON WITHDRAWS!  HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! GO FETCH THE AUTO-VOITURE, PETE!

	He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as 
	customers murmur.

				VOICE
		...it's Babyface Nelson...

	George whirls.

				NELSON
		WHO SAID THAT?!

	The customers stare mutely back.

				NELSON
		WHAT IGNORANT LOWDOWN SLANDERIZING 
		SONOFABITCH SAID THAT?! MY NAME IS 
		GEORGE NELSON, GET ME?!

	The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably 
	about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to 
	steer him toward the door.

				DELMAR
		They didn't mean anything by it, 
		George.

				NELSON
		GEORGE NELSON! NOT BABYFACE! YOU 
		REMEMBER AND YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON, BORN TO RAISE 
		HELL!

	OUTSIDE THE BANK

	The siren grows louder as the four men emerge.

				EVERETT
		You gotta be a little tolerant, 
		George; all these poor folk know is 
		the legend.  Hell, they can't be 
		expected to appreciate the complex 
		individual underneath-  

				NELSON
		Aww, I'm all right-

	He shrugs off Everett's hand and lights the fuse on a stick 
	of dynamite.

				NELSON
		This'll put me right back on top!

	The car squeals up and, as sirens approach once again, the 
	three men pile in.

				NELSON
		OR-VOIR, ITTA BENA! GEORGE NELSON 
		THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

	As the car peels out - KA-BOOM! - the dynamite blows a crater 
	in the street behind.

	CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	George Nelson, now strangely quiet, holds a coffee cup and 
	stares gloomily into the fire.

	After a long beat, Delmar, also staring into the fire, slaps 
	one knee and ejaculates:

				DELMAR
		Damn but that was some fun though, 
		won it George?!

	George responds, barely audible and without brightening:

				GEORGE
		...yeah...

	Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. Delmar, however, 
	is less sensitive to the Babyface's mood.

				DELMAR
		Almost makes me wish I hadn't been 
		saved! Jackin' up banks - I can see 
		how a fella could derive a lot a 
		pleasure and satisfaction out of it!

				GEORGE
		...it's okay...

				DELMAR
		Whoa doggies!

	At length George swishes the coffee around his cup, shrugs, 
	tosses the coffee and rises.

				GEORGE
		...Well, I'm takin' off.

	He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded 
	Delmar.

				GEORGE
		You boys can have the automobile.

	Glassy-eyed, he continues to dig in his pockets and lets his 
	money fall to the ground.

				GEORGE
		'N might as well take my share a the 
		riches.

				DELMAR
		What the - where you goin', George?

	George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the 
	campfire's flickering circle of light.

				GEORGE
		...I dunno... who cares...

	Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's 
	retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money.

				DELMAR
		Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?

				EVERETT
		Well ya know, Delmar, they say that 
		with a thrill-seekin' personality, 
		what goes up must come down. Top of 
		the world one minute, haunted by 
		megrims the next. Yep, it's like our 
		friend George is a alley cat and his 
		own damn humors're swingin' him by 
		the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; 
		he'll be back on top again. I don't 
		think we've heard the last of George 
		Nelson.

	Delmar, gazing out at the blackness that has closed over 
	George Nelson, hasn't really been listening. He turns sadly 
	back.

				DELMAR
		Damn! I liked George.

	A FIELD

	A ploughing farmer has paused to look for the source of 
	distant string-band music, growing closer. There is also an 
	approaching amplified voice:

				VOICE
		Don't be saps for Pappy; vote for 
		Stokes and responsible gummint!

	A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the 
	field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the 
	candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed 
	of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he 
	pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if 
	conducting the music.

				VOICE
		He's against the Innarests and for 
		the little man!

	This, the driver's voice, is amplified through a flared 
	speaker mounted on the roof of the cab. As the oncoming truck 
	draws near, the midget bellows out at the farmer, who has 
	removed his hat to scratch his forehead.

				MIDGET
		Greetings, brother! Vote for Stokes!

	The voice tails away:

				MIDGET
		Clean gummint is yours for the askin'!

	Our pan with the passing truck comes to rest on the WEZY 
	radio building.

	INSIDE

	We are pulling back from a close shot of the portly blind 
	man.

				MAN
		Hang on! Lemme slap up a wire.

	He turns away to load a recording as he talks into a 
	microphone.

				MAN
		Folks, here's my cousin Ezzard's 
		niece Eudora from out Greenwood doin' 
		a little number with her cousin Tom-
		Tom which I predict you're just gonna 
		enjoy thoroughly.

	He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll 
	Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his 
	attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby.

				MAN
		Now what can I do you for, Mister 
		French?

				FRENCH
		How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys?

				MAN
		Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely 
		recollect, uh -

				FRENCH
		They cut a record in here, few days 
		ago, old-timey harmony thing with a 
		guitar Accump-accump-uh-

				MAN
		Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I 
		believe, swell bunch a boys, sung 
		into yon can and skedaddled.

				FRENCH
		Well that record has just gone through 
		the goddamn roof! They're playin' it 
		as far away as Mobile! The whole 
		damn state's goin' ape!

				MAN
		It was a powerful air.

				FRENCH
		Hot damn, we gotta find those boys!  
		Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's 
		bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the 
		goddamn competition will!

				MAN
		Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that 
		competition.

	'I'll Fly Away' mixes up to play full over the following.

	MONTAGE

	- The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun 
	shimmering off the rough pavement. Their bank loot, wrapped 
	in a bandanna, is knotted to the end of a stick slung over 
	Delmar's shoulder.

	- A different road under a threatening sky. The three men 
	stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two 
	little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of 
	ice. A horse-drawn cart rumbles in from offscreen and Everett 
	waggles his thumb. Thunder rumbles.

	- A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black 
	label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy 
	Bottom Boys.

	- A high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping 
	eave of a barn, under which Everett, Pete and Delmar have 
	taken cover. The three hold their coats pinched shut at the 
	neck as they look forlornly up at the weather.

	- The three men walk along a red dirt road elevated through 
	a bayou.

	- The three men sit around a campfire. Everett sits on a 
	stump, expressively telling a ghost story as Pete and Delmar 
	gaze at him from below, wide-eyed and rapt.

	- The three men walk past a cotton field dotted with burst 
	pods.

	- A Woolworth's interior. A sad-faced woman in a calico dress 
	addresses the clerk:

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys 
		performing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'?

				CLERK
		No, ma'am, we had a new shipment in 
		yesterday but we just can't keep it 
		on the shelves.

	The sad-faced woman is crestfallen.

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, mercy. Then - just the purple 
		toilet water.

	- The three men walk down a road excavated through banks of 
	clay, from which gnarled tree roots protrude.

	- A pie rests on a windowsill, steam wafting from it. A hand 
	enters from below the sill outside and disappears with the 
	pie. A moment later we see Everett's and Pete's backs as 
	they scamper away across the yard. A short beat, and then 
	Delmar peeks over the sill. He ducks back down and then his 
	hand reaches up to leave a dollar bill. Moments later we see 
	him scampering away after Pete and Everett.

	- Another campfire. The three men sit around it laughing as 
	they enjoy the pie, each with a slab on a plate improvised 
	of old newspaper. Everett finishes his piece, licks his thumb 
	and tosses the newspaper onto the fire.

	We jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins 
	to curl its edge. A story is headlined 'TVA Finalizing Plans 
	for Flooding of Arktabutta Valley'. The flame curls the page 
	away, briefly revealing the page beneath - with a story 
	headlined 'Soggy Bottom Boys a Sensation - But Who Are They?' - 
	before it too is consumed.

	- A little general store. We are very high, looking down at 
	a foreshortened Everett, Pete, Delmar and store clerk, who 
	is wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward 
	us. Everett is pointing up, directing the man with the pole. 
	He moves it tentatively to and fro until, at a certain point, 
	Everett nods vigorously.

	A reverse shows the end of the pole - a long stock-pincher - 
	as it closes over a tin of Dapper Dan pomade, resting on a 
	high shelf.

	The exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a 
	little crossroads town. The three men are emerging from the 
	store just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubble-topped 
	gas pumps out front. A fancyman in a boater hat gets out of 
	the car and heads for the store, passing the three; Everett 
	glances at him and, as the man disappears inside, he dives 
	into his car, waving for Delmar and Pete to follow. Delmar, 
	initially reluctant, is hauled into the car by Pete, and the 
	men take off.

	- The spinning 78 recording, as the song enters its last 
	verse.

	- A spinning car wheel.

	- A panoramic boom up as the car toodles away, down a road 
	that winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset.

	THE CAR

	The three men are driving through the heat of the day. Everett 
	drives; Pete is slouched in the front passenger seat; Delmar, 
	in back, picks out 'I'll Fly Away' on a banjo.

	Pete listens to something, squints, tilts his head.

				PETE
		...Shutup, Delmar.

	Delmar and Everett exchange glances; Everett shrugs and Delmar 
	desists.

	We can faintly hear a high, unearthly singing. Barely human, 
	the sound seems to agitate Pete. He looks desperately out 
	the window.

	His hinging point-of-view shows, down the declivity from the 
	road and half hidden by trees, three women washing clothes 
	in the river.

	Pete's reaction is enormous. He jams a fist into his mouth, 
	eyes widening. He yanks the fist out and screams:

				PETE
		PULL OVER!

	Everett, startled, does so.

	EXT.

	Before the car has even come to a stop Pete's door flies 
	open and he is stumbling down the bank to the river.

	Everett and Delmar follow more casually, Everett chuckling.

				EVERETT
		I guess o' Pete's got the itch.

	AT THE RIVER

	The unearthly singing, full volume here, comes from the three 
	women, beautiful but marked by an otherworldly langor as 
	they dunk clothes in the stream and beat them against rocks.

	Pete is all awkward smiles and deep, burning eyes:

				PETE
		Howdy do, ladies. Name of Pete!

	Strangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they 
	do smile at him as they continue to sing.

	Pete tries again as he reaches into their laundry basket:

				PETE
		Maybe I could help you with the, uh-

	He realizes he is holding ladies' undergarments.

				PETE
		Ahem. I, uh...

	He drops them back in the basket.

				PETE
		I don't believe I've, uh, heard that 
		song before...

	Everett and Delmar have arrived; Everett is loud and jovial:

				EVERETT
		Aintcha gonna innerduce us, Pete?

	Pete's eyes stay glued on the women as he hisses out of the 
	corner of his mouth:

				PETE
		Don't know their names. I seen 'em 
		first!

	Everett laughs lightly.

				EVERETT
		Ladies, you'll have to pardon my 
		friend here; Pete is dirt-ignorant 
		and unschooled in the social arts. 
		My name on the other hand is Ulysses 
		Everett McGill and you ladies are 
		about the three prettiest water lilies 
		it's ever been my privilege to admire.

	None of the women respond but, as all continue to sing, one 
	brings a jug marked with three Xes to Everett.

				EVERETT
		Why, thank you dear, that's very, 
		uh...

	He takes a swig.

				EVERETTE
		Mm. Corn licker, I guess, uh, the 
		preferred local uh...

	He passes the jug to Pete as the woman runs her fingers 
	through his hair.

	The other two women are approaching to likewise tousle Pete 
	and Delmar.

	Delmar's woman caresses his face and, by squeezing his cheeks, 
	smushes his mouth into a pucker.

				DELMAR
		Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

	The singing continues. The stream gurgles. Somewhere, in the 
	distance, flies lazily buzz.

				PETE
		Damn!

								FADE OUT

								 FADE IN

	CLOSE ON DELMAR

	We are very tight. Delmar's eyes are closed. We hear loud 
	snoring. At length his eyelids flutter open, but the snoring 
	continues.

	Delmar groggily props himself on one elbow.

	It is late afternoon. He is still on the riverbank. Everett 
	snores nearby.

	The ladies are gone. The hamper of laundry is gone. Pete is 
	gone.

	After looking blearily about for a moment, Delmar starts and 
	staggers to his feet.

				DELMAR
		Holy Saint Christopher!

	He toes Everett urgently in the ribs.

				EVERETT
		Whuhh...

				DELMAR
		Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

	Pete's clothes are laid out on the ground, not in a heap, 
	but mimicking the human shape, as if he had been simply 
	vaporized fron within them.

	Everett rouses himself and looks at the clothes: He scans 
	the opposite river bank.

				EVERETT
		PETE! Where the heck are ya! We ain't 
		got time for your shenanigans!

	Delmar stares horrified at the pile of clothes: a spot in 
	the middle of the shirt is rising and falling, rising and 
	falling.

				DELMAR
		Sweet Jesus, Everett! They left his 
		heart!

	Everett joins Delmar to look. The rhythmic rising and falling 
	now travels up the shirt. A large yellow toad sticks its 
	head out from under the collar.

	Delmar keens. Everett is bewildered.

				EVERETT
		What on earth is goin' on here! What's 
		got into you, Delmar!

				DELMAR
		Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh-
		reens did this to Pete! They loved 
		him up an' turned him into a horney-
		toad!

	The toad hops down the river bank.

				DELMAR
		Pete! Come back!

	He slides down the bank after the toad, Everett watching in 
	perturbation.

	The toad plops into the river and Delmar dives in after him. 
	He emerges a moment later with the toad wriggling in his 
	hand.

				DELMAR
		Don't worry, Pete! It's me, Delmar! 
		Oh Everett! What're we gonna do?!

	DRIVING

	We hear soft whimpering as Everett drives, sneaking worried 
	glances over at the passenger seat.

	Delmar has the toad in his lap. He whimpers as he pets it.

	Everett hesitantly offers:

				EVERETT
		...I'm not sure that's Pete.

				DELMAR
		Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

	The frog croaks.

				DELMAR
		We gotta find some kinda wizard can 
		change 'im back!

	A beat. Delmar continues to whimper.

	Everett squints and shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		...I'm just not sure that's Pete.

	FINE RESTAURANT

	The tables are formally laid with linen. Delmar and Everett 
	sit at a table, a shoebox between them, deep in conversation.

				EVERETT
		You can't display a toad in a fine 
		restaurant like this! Why, the good 
		folks here'd go right off their feed!

				DELMAR
		I just don't think it's right, keepin' 
		him under wraps like we's ashamed of 
		him.

				EVERETT
		Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of 
		him.  The way I see it he got what 
		he deserved - fornicating with some 
		whore a Babylon.  These things-

	He points a knife at the shoebox.

				EVERETT
		-don't happen for no reason, Delmar.
		Obviously it's some kind of judgment 
		on Pete's character.

	ANOTHER PATRON

	We are looking over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man 
	in a cream-colored suit and a shirt with powder-blue collar. 
	He is digging into a huge plateful of steak and eggs. Sensing 
	something, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns 
	to look back.

	He thus reveals a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue 
	trim; his good eye is looking intently off - at Everett and 
	Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	Still heatedly discussing.

				DELMAR
		The two of us was fixing to fornicate!

	The waitress has just arrived for their order. Everett gives 
	her an ingratiating laugh:

				EVERETT
		Heh-heh. You'll have to excuse my 
		rusticated friend here, unaccustomed 
		as he is to city manners.

	He ostentatiously fans some of his money.

				EVERETT
		Well mamzel I guess we'll have a 
		couple a steaks and some gratinated 
		potatoes and wash it down with your 
		finest bubbly wine-

	BIG MAN

	Watching Everett fan his money. The big man stops chewing 
	and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty 
	pat.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	As Everett closes his menu.

				EVERETT
		...And I don't suppose the chef'd 
		have any nits or grubs in the pantry, 
		or - naw, never mind, just bring me 
		a couple leafs a raw cabbage.

				WAITRESS
		Yes sir.

	The big man appears as she leaves.

				BIG MAN
		Don't believe I've seen you boys 
		around here before! Allow me 
		t'innerduce myself: name of Daniel 
		Teague, known in these precincts as 
		Big Dan Teague or, to those who're 
		pressed for time, Big Dan toot court.

				EVERETT
		How d'you do, Big Dan. I'm Ulysses 
		Everett McGill; this is my associate 
		Delmar O'Donnell.  I sense that, 
		like me, you are endowed with the 
		gift of gab.

	Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair.

				BIG DAN
		I flatter myself that such is the 
		case; in my line of work it's plumb 
		necessary. The one thing you don't 
		want is air in the conversation.

				EVERETT
		Once again we find ourselves in 
		agreement.  What kind of work do you 
		do, Big Dan?

				BIG DAN
		Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what 
		do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed 
		word of it, from Genesee on down to 
		Revelations! That's right, the word 
		of God, which let me add there is 
		damn good money in during these days 
		of woe and want! Folks're lookin' 
		for answers and Big Dan Teague sells 
		the only book that's got 'em! What 
		do you do - you and your tongue-tied 
		friend?

				DELMAR
		Uh, we uh-

				EVERETT
		We're adventurers, sir, currently 
		pursuin' a certain opportunity but 
		open to others as well.

				BIG DAN
		I like your style, young man, so I'm 
		gonna propose you a proposition. You 
		cover my check so I don't have to 
		run back up to my room, have your 
		waitress wrap your dinner picnic-
		style, and we'll retire to more 
		private environs where I will explain 
		to you how vast amounts of money can 
		be made in the service of God Amighty.

	Everett rises and digs in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		Well, why not. If nothing else I 
		could use some civilized conversation.

	As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a 
	tilt of the head and a crinkling smile.

				BIG DAN
		Don't forget your shoebox, friend.

	We hear bellowing issuing from a curtained private dining-
	room.

	INSIDE THE PRIVATE ROOM

	Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of 
	whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue.

				PAPPY
		Languishing! Goddamn campaign is 
		languishing! We need a shot inna 
		arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn 
		ARM!  Election held tomorra, that 
		sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a 
		walk!

				JUNIOR
		Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

	Pappy narrows his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting 
	at.

				PAPPY
		...Yeah?

				JUNIOR
		Well people like that reform. Maybe 
		we should get us some.

	Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it.

				PAPPY
		I'll reform you, you soft-headed 
		sonofabitch! How we gonna run reform 
		when we're the damn incumbent!

	He glares around the table.

				PAPPY
		Zat the best idea any you boys can 
		come up with? REEform?! Weepin' Jesus 
		on the cross! Eckard, you may as 
		well start draftin' my concession 
		speech right now.

	Eckard grunts as he starts to rise.

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	Pappy whips him back down with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'm just makin' a point, you stupid 
		sonofabitch!

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	As he settles back Eckard looks around the table and helpfully 
	relays:

				ECKARD
		Pappy just makin' a point here, boys.

	A MEADOW

	The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off 
	the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with 
	bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak.

	Everett, Delmar and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large 
	picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of 
	chicken off a bone.

	He tosses the bone over his shoulder, belches, and sighs.

				BIG DAN
		Thankee boys for throwin' in that 
		fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite 
		and even with lunch under my belt I 
		was feeling a mite peckish.

				EVERETT
		Our pleasure, Big Dan.

				BIG DAN
		And thank you as well for that 
		conversational hiatus; I generally 
		refrain from speech while engaged in 
		gustation. There are those who attempt 
		both at the same time but I find it 
		course and vulgar. Now where were 
		we?

				DELMAR
		Makin' money in the Lord's service.

				BIG DAN
		You don't say much friend, but when 
		you do it's to the point and I salute 
		you for it.

	Delmar is pleased and embarrassed.

				DELMAR
		Oh, it weren't nothin', I-

				BIG DAN
		Yes, Bible sales. The trade is not a 
		complicated one; there're but two 
		things to learn. One bein' where to 
		find your wholesaler - word of God 
		in bulk as it were. Two bein' how to 
		reckanize your customer - who're you 
		dealin' with? - an exercise in 
		psychology so to speak.

	He rises to his feet and tosses down his napkin.

				BIG DAN
		And it is that which I propose to 
		give you a lesson in right now.

	He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off 
	a tree. He casually strips its twigs.

				EVERETT
		I like to think that I'm a pretty 
		astute observer of the human scene.

				BIG DAN
		No doubt, brother - I figured as 
		much back there in the restaurant. 
		That's why I invited you out here 
		for this advanced tutorial.

	His club is ready. He swings at Delmar who staggers back 
	with a grunt.

	Everett wears a puzzled smile.

				EVERETT
		...What's goin' on, Big Dan?

	Delmar, though stunned, is faster to size things up. He 
	charges Big Dan and wraps his arms around him.

	Delmar roars.

	Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head.

	Everett is still puzzled, but willing to be instructed:

				EVERETT
		Big Dan, what're you doin'?

	Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still 
	attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear. Big 
	Dan takes a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow 
	to Everett.

	The blow catches Everett on the chin and sends him reeling.

				BIG DAN
		It's all about money, boys! Atsy 
		answer! Dough re mi!

	Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away. He whacks 
	Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then paws through his 
	pockets.

				BIG DAN
		Do unto others before they do unto 
		you!

	He pulls out their wad of cash.

				BIG DAN
		I'll just take your show cards...

	He walks over to Delmar who is on the ground moaning, and 
	kicks him several times.

				BIG DAN
		...and whatever you got in the hole.

	He takes Delmar's shoebox and flips off the top.

	Inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it.

				BIG DAN
		What the...

	He pokes around the straw with his finger; nothing else 
	inside.

				BIG DAN
		It's nothin' but a damn toad!

	Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes.

	Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist.

	Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips:

				DELMAR
		No... you don't understand...

				BIG DAN
		Don't you boys know these things 
		give ya warts?

	He squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against 
	a tree.

				DELMAR
		Oh Lord... Pete...

	Big Dan is over at the car, cranking it up.

				BIG DAN
		End of lesson.

	He climbs in.

				BIG DAN
		So long, boys! Hee-hee! See ya in 
		the funny papers!

	The car belches and pops and toodles off down the road.

	Delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass 
	of the frog, weeping.

				DELMAR
		Pete... Pete... Pete...

								FADE OUT

	PAN DOWN FROM BLACK TO BRING IN A TORCH

	Flickering in the night. We hear the rumble of distant thunder 
	as the continued pan down brings the torch's bearer into 
	frame - a man with the slavering grin of the dim-witted 
	sadist. He watches as we hear:

				VOICE
		Where are they?!

	There is the sound of a lash and a scream.

				VOICE
		Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a 
		whore! Where they headed?

	Another lash brings another scream.

	The screams come from Pete. His arms, stretched high over 
	his head, are tied to a tree limb. His interrogator wields a 
	bullwhip.

				INTERROGATOR
		Your screams ain't gonna save your 
		flesh! Only your tongue is, boy!

	Another lash, another scream.

				INTERROGATOR
		Where they headed!

	A third man walks into the torchlight, a hound drooling at 
	his heels. He is Cooley, the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses 
	whom we remember from previous barn confrontations.

				COOLEY
		Lump. I.O.

	The two men acknowledge by backing away from Pete.

	We hear a pat... pat... and then the accelerating pitter-
	patter of arriving rain.

	Cooley looks up.

				COOLEY
		Sweet summer rain. Like God's own 
		mercy.

	He looks back down at Pete.

				COOLEY
		Your two friends have abandoned you, 
		Pete.  They don't seem to care 'bout 
		your hide.

	He shrugs, looks off.

				COOLEY
		...Okay.

	Looking up, into black: a rope is tossed up - it recedes out 
	of the torchlight into black night - and then drops back 
	down into the light, a noose bouncing at its end.

				COOLEY
		Stairway to heaven, Pete.

	The two henchmen fit the noose over Pete's neck. Cooley licks 
	his lips. His dog slobbers.

				COOLEY
		We shall all meet, by and by.

				PETE
		Goddamnit!

	Cooley holds up one hand. The two men pause in fitting the 
	noose.

	Pete is sobbing:

				PETE
		Godfer gimme!

	Thunder crashes.

	BACK OF A HAYTRUCK

	Everett and Delmar sit disconsolately on a haybale as the 
	stakebed truck bounces along a rough country road. They are 
	both ill-kempt and heavily bruised.

	Though still an undammable river of verbiage, Everett now 
	seems to be talking out of weary habit, not conviction:

				EVERETT
		Believe me, Delmar, he would've wanted 
		us to press on. Pete, rest his soul, 
		was one sour-assed sonofabitch and 
		not given to acts of pointless 
		sentimentality.

	Delmar doggedly shakes his head.

				DELMAR
		It just don't seem right, diggin' up 
		that treasure without him.

	We distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting. Hollow-
	eyed, Everett tries to convince himself as much as Delmar:

				EVERETT
		Maybe it's for the best that Pete 
		was squushed. Why, he was barely a 
		sentient bein'. Now, soon as we clean 
		ourselves up, get a little smell'um 
		in our hair, we're just gonna feel a 
		hunnert per cent better about 
		ourselves and about...

	His voice trails away as he looks out at the road.

	They are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and 
	duck-billed caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side 
	of the road. Guards bearing shotguns amble back and forth.

	As he stares at the line of men Everett tries to pick up his 
	thread:

				EVERETT
		...and about... life in general...

	The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust.

				EVERETT
		Jesus. We must be near Parchman Farm.

	The men, giving throat to a dolorous chain-gang chant, do 
	not look up at the passing haytruck.

	Everett is haunted:

				EVERETT
		Sorry sonsabitches... Seems like a 
		year ago we bust off the farm...

	The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, 
	looks up. Everett stares.

	It is Pete.

	Lone and lorn, he returns Everett's slack-jawed stare until 
	heat ripples and the truck's dusty wake dissolve him away.

	Everett blinks.

				EVERETT
		Pete have a brother?

				DELMAR
		Not that I'm aware.

	Everett shakes his head as if to clear it.

				EVERETT
		Heat must be gettin' to me.

	The truck rattles on.

	TOWN SQUARE

	Ithaca, Mississippi. On a bunting-covered stage a pencil-
	necked man with round rimless glasses addresses a crowd of 
	rustics.

	The pencil-neck is identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, 
	Friend of the Little Man', and, in life as in the pictures, 
	he shakes a broom over his head. A midget in overalls stands 
	next to him.

				STOKES
		And I say to you that the great state 
		a Mississippi cannot afford four 
		more years a Pappy O'Daniel - four 
		more years a cronyism, nepotism, 
		rascalism and service to the 
		Innarests!  The choice, she's a clear 
		'un: Pappy O'Daniel, slave a the 
		Innarests; Homer Stokes, servant a 
		the little man! Ain't that right, 
		little fella?

	The midget enthusiastically seconds:

				MIDGET
		He ain't lyin'!

				STOKES
		When the litle man says jump, Homer 
		Stokes says how high? And, ladies'n 
		jettymens, the little man has 
		admonished me to grasp the broom a -
		ree-form and sweep this state clean!

	The midget waves his little midget broom in time with Stoke's 
	waves.

				STOKES
		It's gonna be back to the flour mill, 
		Pappy! The Innarests can take care a 
		theyselves! Come Tuesday, we gonna 
		sweep the rascals out! Clean gummint - 
		yours for the askin'!

	He beams amid cheers and then, as three girls in gingham 
	frocks run out to join him:

				STOKES
		An' now - the little Wharvey gals!  
		Whatcha got for us, darlin's?

	The oldest girl is about ten.

				LITTLE GIRL
		'In the Highways'!

				STOKES
		That's fine.

	The haytruck has pulled into the square and Everett and Delmar 
	are climbing out.

	Everett stares at the stage.

				EVERETT
		Wharvey gals?! Did he just say the 
		little Wharvey gals?

	Delmar shrugs. For some reason, Everett is enraged:

				EVERETT
		Goddamnit all!

	Onstage, the three girls are singing in untrained but 
	enthusiastic harmony:

				GIRLS
		In the highways, In the hedges...

	Everett stomps toward the stage, fighting his way through 
	the crowd. Puzzled, Delmar follows.

				DELMAR
		You know them gals, Everett?

	Everett reaches the stage and climbs up into the wings just 
	as the song ends. The midget starts buck-dancing to a fiddle 
	tune as the three little girls, filing off, notice Everett.

				YOUNGEST
		Daddy!

				MIDDLE
		He ain't our daddy!

				EVERETT
		Hell I ain't! Whatsis 'Wharvey' gals? - 
		Your name's McGill!

				YOUNGEST
		No sir! Not since you got hit by a 
		train!

				EVERETT
		What're you talkin' about - I wasn't 
		hit by a train!

				MIDDLE
		Mama said you was hit by a train!

				YOUNGEST
		Blooey!

				OLDEST
		Nothin' left!

				MIDDLE
		Just a grease spot on the L&N!

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I never been hit by any train!

				OLDEST
		At's right! So Mama's got us back to 
		Wharvey!

				MIDDLE
		That's a maiden name.

				YOUNGEST
		You got a maiden name, Daddy?

				EVERETT
		No, Daddy ain't got a maiden name; 
		ya see -

				MIDDLE
		That's your misfortune!

				YOUNGEST
		At's right! And now Mama's got a new 
		beau!

				OLDEST
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Yeah, I know 'bout that.

				MIDDLE
		Mama says he's bona fide!

	This worries Everett:

				EVERETT
		Hm. He give her a ring?

				YOUNGEST
		Yassir, big'un!

				MIDDLE
		Gotta gem!

				OLDEST
		Mama checked it!

				YOUNGEST
		It's bona fide!

				MIDDLE
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Hm. What's his name?

				MIDDLE
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				YOUNGEST
		Uncle Vernon.

				OLDEST
		Till tomorrow.

				YOUNGEST
		Then he's gonna be Daddy!

				EVERETT
		I'm the only damn daddy you got! I'm 
		the damn paterfamilias!

				OLDEST
		Yeah, but you ain't bona fide!

				EVERETT
		Hm. Where's your mama?

	Stokes is announcing from the stage:

				STOKES
		And now let's fetch back the Wharvey 
		gals to sing 'I'll Fly Away'.

	The girls call over their shoulders as they run back onstage:

				MIDDLE
		She's at the five and dime.

				YOUNGEST
		Buyin' nipples!

	WOOLWORTH'S

	The faces of a six-year-old girl and her four-year-old sister 
	light up.

				GIRLS
		Daddy!

	Next to them is a two-year-old girl with a string wrapped 
	around her waist. The other end of the string is held by a 
	woman in her thirties with a haggard, careworn face. The 
	woman also holds a babe-in-arms.

	Everett, entering, goggles at the infant.

				EVERETT
		Who the hell is that?!

				WOMAN
		Starla Wharvey.

				EVERETT
		Starla McGill you mean! How come you 
		never told me about her?

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		'Cause you was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		And that's another thing - why're 
		you tellin' our gals I was hit by a 
		train!

				WOMAN
		Lotta respectable people been hit by 
		trains. Judge Hobby over in Cookeville 
		was hit by a train. What was I 
		supposed to tell 'em - that you was 
		sent to the penal farm and I divorced 
		you from shame?

				EVERETT
		Well - I take your point. But it 
		leaves me in a damned awkward position 
		vis-a-vis my progeny.

	A man in a straw boater joins them.

				BOATER
		'Lo Penny... This gentleman bothering 
		you?

				EVERETT
		You Waldrip?

				BOATER
		That's right.

	Everett sniffs and, catching a scent, squints.

	Waldrip's hair, protruding from under his boater, is plastered 
	against his scalp.

				EVERETT
		...Have you been using my hair 
		treatment?

				WALDRIP
		Your hair treatment?!

	Everett covers his anger with an exaggerated politeness.

				EVERETT
		S'cuse me...

	He draws Penny aside.

				EVERETT
		Well, I got news for you case you 
		hadn't noticed - I wasn't hit by a 
		train. And I've traveled many a weary 
		mile to be back with my wife and six 
		daughters.

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		Seven, Daddy!

				PENNY
		That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. 
		Your daddy was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		Now Penny, stop that!

				PENNY
		No - you stop it! Vernon here's got 
		a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's 
		bona fide! What're you?

				EVERETT
		I'll tell you what I am - I'm the 
		paterfamilias! You can't marry him!

				PENNY
		I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! 
		I gotta think about the little Wharvey 
		gals! They look to me for answers! 
		Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em 
		lessons on the clarinet! The only 
		good thing you ever did for the gals 
		was get his by that train!

				EVERETT
		...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... 
		succubus!

				WALDRIP
		You can't swear at my fiancee!

				EVERETT
		Oh yeah? Well you can't marry my 
		wife!

	With this he takes a wild swing which Waldrip easily eludes.   
	Waldrip adapts a Marquess of Queensbury stance and prances 
	about, delivering stinging punches to the nose of a stunned 
	and outclassed Everett.

	A crowd is gathering and voices murmur:

				BYSTANDERS
		Who is that man?

				PENNY
		He's not my husband. Just a drifter, 
		I guess... Just some no-account 
		drifter...

	EXT. WOOLWORTH'S

	Its glass doors swing open and Everett is hurled out and 
	bellyflops into the dust of the street.

				BRAWNY MANAGER
		...And stay out of Woolworth's!

	MOVIE THEATER

	Romantic music tinnily plays as Delmar and Everett watch, 
	Everett slumped down and angrily hissing:

				EVERETT
		Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! 
		Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember 
		that one simple precept and your 
		time with me will not have been ill 
		spent!

				DELMAR
		Okay, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' 
		to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the 
		subjective!  You ever been with a 
		woman?

				DELMAR
		Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family 
		farm back before I can start thinkin' 
		about that.

				EVERETT
		Well that's right! If then! Believe 
		me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish 
		instrument of torture ever devised 
		to bedevil the days a man!

				DELMAR
		Everett, I never figured you for a 
		paterfamilias.

				EVERETT
		Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. 
		And you see what it, uh... what it's 
		earned me... Now what in the...

	The screen is flickering down to black as the music slows to 
	sludge and stops.

	The theater is dark and quiet.

	Everett and Delmar, and the rest of the sparse audience, 
	look restively about.

	A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium.

	He walks halfway down the aisle and stops several rows behind 
	Delmar and Everett. He scans the theater, then brings a 
	whistle to his lips.

	At his whistle the back doors burst open and a line of chained 
	men trot in at double-time. With much clanking they file 
	into one row and then, that row filled, the one behind it. 
	They remain silently on their feet.

	The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts 
	scan the theater. The first guard again blows his whistle.

	The two rows of chained men sit.

	After another silence:

				FIRST GUARD
		...Okay boys! Enjoy yer pickcha show!

	One more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed.

	A hissing whisper from behind draws Everett and Delmar's 
	attention:

				VOICE
		Do not seek the treasure! It's a 
		bushwhack!

	Everett and Delmar turn and stare, saucer-eyed. In the middle 
	of the frontmost row of convicts sits Pete - bald, haunted 
	Pete.

	After a long, disbelieving stare:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

	Pete whispers again, urgently:

				PETE
		They're fixin' a ambush! Do not seek 
		the treasure!

	Everett, jaw hanging open, can only stare, as if at a ghost. 
	Delmar stares also, but finally brings out another:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

				PETE
		Do not seek the treasure!

	Everett's face remains frozen in horrified disbelief, but 
	Delmar finally accepts Pete's corporeal reality.

				DELMAR
		We thought you was a toad!

	Pete squints and cocks his head as if to say, What was that?

	Delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth 
	movements:

				DELMAR
		We thought... you was... a toad!

	Pete shakes his head - didn't catch it - and repeats, also 
	overarticulating:

				PETE
		Do not... seek... the treasure!

	A guard murmurs:

				GUARD
		Quiet there. Watcha pickcha.

	VERANDA

	Pappy O'Daniel sits on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion, 
	smoking a cigar and sipping from a glass of bourbon as the 
	evening sun goes down.

				PAPPY
		I signed that bill! I signed a dozen 
		a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone 
		knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! 
		What do I gotta do, start diddlin' 
		livestock?!

				JUNIOR
		We cain't do that, Daddy, we might 
		offend our constichency.

				PAPPY
		We ain't got a constichency! Stokes 
		got a constichency!

				ECKARD
		Them straw polls is ugly.

				SPIVEY
		Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.

				ECKARD
		Gonna pluck us off the tit.

				SPIVEY
		Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants 
		down and Stokes at the table soppin' 
		up the gravy.

				ECKARD
		Latch right on to that tit.

				SPIVEY
		Wipin' little circles with his bread.

				ECKARD
		Suckin' away.

				SPIVEY
		Well, it's a well-run campaign, 
		midget'n broom'n whatnot.

				ECKARD
		Devil his due.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva awgazation.

				JUNIOR
		Say, I gotten idee.

				ECKARD
		What sat, Junior?

				JUNIOR
		We could hire us a little fella even 
		smaller'n Stokes's.

	Pappy whips at him with his hat.

				PAPPY
		Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a 
		guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha 
		satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies 
		braggin' on our own midget! Don't 
		matter how stumpy! And that's the 
		goddamn problem right there - people 
		think this Stokes got fresh ideas, 
		he's oh coorant and we the past.

				ECKARD
		Problem a p'seption.

				SPIVEY
		Ass right.

				ECKARD
		Reason why he's pullin' ah pants 
		down.

				SPIVEY
		Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.

				ECKARD
		Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna 
		kick it real hard.

	With his mouth forming an O around his dropping cigar, Pappy 
	looks sadly from one to the other, like a spectator at a 
	particularly boring tennis match.

				SPIVEY
		No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle 
		it.

				ECKARD
		Well now, I don't believe assa 
		property scription.

				SPIVEY
		Well, that's how I characterize it.

				ECKARD
		Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' 
		sichation.

				SPIVEY
		Pullin' ah pants down...

				ECKARD
		Wipin' little circles with his 
		bread...

	A NOOSE

	In slow motion it is dropping... dropping... dropping through 
	the night. We hear distant thunder and the howl of a hound. 
	The sounds recede, and the black background dissolves into a 
	pan down from a raftered ceiling as the noose fades away.

	The continued pan down shows that we are in a barracks-like 
	cabin. It is night. Convicts are ranged in bunk-beds. Their 
	snores stand out against the chirp of crickets.

	In the upper berth of the foreground bed is Pete. His hands 
	are clasped behind his head. A manacle and chain links one 
	wrist to a rail that serves as headboard.

	He stares up, haunted, at the phantom noose.

				PETE
		I could not gaze upon that far 
		shore...

	He reacts quizically to a whispered:

				VOICE
		Pete!

	A moment later Everett rises over the lip of his bed. His 
	face is blacked and he sways as if standing on a boat.

				EVERETT
		Hold still.

	He is raising a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering 
	tool. He locks the nose onto Pete's chain and levers the 
	arms. As his hand chinks free, Pete does not react to his 
	newfound liberty.

	We hear an agonized voice from off as Everett continues to 
	sway:

				DELMAR
		...Cain't stand much longer.

	Pete's eyes burn into Everett's.

				PETE
		It was a moment a weakness!

				EVERETT
		Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to 
		skedaddle.

	THE THREE MEN

	We track with them as they walk through the moonlit woods. 
	Delmar's and Everett's faces are thoroughly blacked; Pete is 
	just finishing blacking his, and he hands the shoe polish 
	back to Everett.

				PETE
		They lured me out for a bathe, then 
		they dunked me'n trussed me up like 
		a hog and turned me in for the bounty.

				EVERETT
		I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly 
		behavior. Just lucky we left before 
		they came for us.

				DELMAR
		We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just 
		thought you was a toad.

				PETE
		No, they never did turn me into a 
		toad.

				DELMAR
		Well that was our mistake then. And 
		then we was beat up by a bible 
		salesman and banished from 
		Woolworth's. I don't know if it's 
		the one branch or all of 'em.

				PETE
		Well I - I ain't had it easy either, 
		boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled 
		my guts about the treasure.

				DELMAR
		Huh?!

				PETE
		Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; 
		must be my Hogwallop blood.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right, Pete.

	Pete is shaking his head, miserable.

				PETE
		It's awful white of ya to take it 
		like that, Everett. I feel wretched, 
		spoilin' yer play for a million 
		dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' 
		at my guts.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right.

	Pete starts weeping.

				PETE
		You boys're true friends!

	He hugs a stunned Delmar.

				PETE
		You're m'boon companions!

	He hugs Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable.

				EVERETT
		Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat 
		yourself up about this thing...

				PETE
		I cain't help it, but that's a 
		wonderful thing to say!

				EVERETT
		Well, but Pete...

	He clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Uh, the fact of the matter is - well, 
		damnit, there ain't no treasure!

	Now it is Pete's turn to be stunned. He and Delmar stare at 
	Everett.

				EVERETT
		Fact of the matter - there never 
		was!

				PETE
		But... but...

				DELMAR
		So - where's all the money from your 
		armored-car job?

				EVERETT
		I never knocked over any armored-
		car. I was sent up for practicing 
		law without a license.

				PETE
		But...

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My 
		wife wrote me she was gettin' married! 
		I gotta stop it!

	Pete stares vacantly off.

				PETE
		...No treasure... I had two weeks 
		left on my sentence...

				EVERETT
		I couldn't wait two weeks! She's 
		gettin' married tomorra!

				PETE
		...With my added time for the escape, 
		I don't get out now 'til 1987... 
		I'll be eighty-four years old.

	Delmar, not angry himself, is trying to work it out.

				DELMAR
		Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty 
		years for me too.

				EVERETT
		Boys, we was chained together. I 
		hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out 
		alone was not a option!

				PETE
		...Eighty-four years old.

	Delmar brightens.

				DELMAR
		I'll only be eighty-two.

	Pete lunges at Everett.

				PETE
		YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

	He tackles him and, with his hands wrapped round Everett's 
	throat, the two roll over.

				EVERETT
			(strangled)
		Pete... I do apologize.

				PETE
		Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' 
		pab-you-lum!

	They have rolled through some brush and their bodies are now 
	halfway into a clearing. They abruptly stop.

	Pete, lying on top of Everett, looks up, startled by loud 
	chanting. Everett, lying on his back, tries to see as well, 
	his eyes rolling back in his head.

	Their point-of-view shows a great open field where men in 
	bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross.

	Pete and Everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and 
	then push through with Delmar.

	The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, 
	intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At 
	length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to 
	face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning 
	cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold.

	An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the 
	burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The 
	backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from 
	the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett.

	As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, 
	whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet.

				BLACK MAN
		I ain't never harmed any you 
		gentlemen!

	Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		It's Tommy! They got Tommy!

				DELMAR
		Oh my God!

	It is indeed Tommy Johnson.

				TOMMY
		I ain't never harmed nobody!

	Pete is staring aghast at the makeshift gibbet.

				PETE
		The noose. Sweet Jesus! We gotta 
		save 'im!

	A broad-shouldered man in the middle of the ranks of Klansmen, 
	sensing something, slowly turns to look back over his 
	shoulder. He thus reveals that his hood has only one eye-
	hole.

	He slowly draws off his hood. It is, of course, Big Dan 
	Teague. His one good eye looks about; his other eye, now 
	revealed, is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed 
	sightlessness.

	Everett, still crouched behind the bushes, notices something. 
	He hisses and points.

				EVERETT
		The color guard.

	Off to one side is a robed and hooded three-man color guard 
	displaying a Confederate flag.

	In front of the crowd the Imperial Wizard raises one satin-
	draped arm, and the chanting stops.

				WIZARD
		Brothers! We are foregathered here 
		to preserve our hallowed culture'n 
		heritage!  From intrusions, inclusions 
		and dilutions!  Of culluh! Of creed! 
		Of our ol'-time religion!

	Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening 
	up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having 
	disposed of the color guard.

				WIZARD
		We aim to pull evil up by the root! 
		Before it chokes out the flower of 
		our culture'n heritage! And our women! 
		Let's not forget those ladies, y'all, 
		lookin' to us for p'tection! From 
		darkies! From Jews! From Papists! 
		And from all those smart-ass folk 
		say we come descended from the 
		monkeys!  That's not my culture'n 
		heritage!

	A roar from the crowd.

				WIZARD
		Izzat your culture'n heritage?

	Another roar.

				WIZARD
		And so... we gonna hang us a neegra!

	A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting.

	The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the 
	two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy! It's us!

	Behind Everett in the deep background someone emerges from 
	the ranks into the middle aisle. He approaches with a strong, 
	purposeful stride - Big Dan Teague, bareheaded, holding his 
	hood under his arm.

	Everett hisses again:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy!

	Tommy looks back over his shoulder.

				TOMMY
		...Huh?

	Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind.

				EVERETT
		It's us! We come to rescue ya!

				TOMMY
		That's mighty kind of ya boys, but I 
		don't think nothin's gonna save me 
		now - the devil's come to collect 
		his due!

				PETE
		Tommy, you don't wanna get hanged!

				TOMMY
		Naw I don't guess I do, but that's 
		the way it seems to be workin' out.

				EVERETT
		Listen to me, Tommy, I got a plan -

	Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. 
	Everett is exposed - in blackface.

	The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned.

	Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in 
	blackface.

	From the crowd:

				VOICE
		The color guard is colored!

	Big Dan roars.

	The crowd roars.

	Everett screams:

				EVERETT
		Run, boys!

	Pandemonium breaks out, and the Imperial Wizard takes off 
	his red satin hood for a better view.

	He is the reform candidate Homer Stokes. Next to him, his 
	midget also pulls of his midget hood.

	Stokes is peeved.

				STOKES
		Who made them the color guard?

	Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate 
	flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating 
	the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues 
	in full cry.

	When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. 
	He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd.

	Homer Stokes is mortified.

				STOKES
		Damn! Can't let that flag touch the 
		ground!

	The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence.

	The only sound is the fluttering flag.

	Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the 
	flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend.

	We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned 
	white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague.

	His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off 
	returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging 
	distance and trajectory.

	From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping.

	The flag flutters.

	The crowd is silent.

	Big Dan sets and...

	WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together.

	He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the 
	ground.

	The crowd cheers.

	Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers.

	From somewhere, another BOINK.

	As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades.

	His eye tracks up - up-

	CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.

	At the foot of the cross Everett snaps its last guy wire 
	with his pincers - BOINK - and the four men sprint off.

	WHOOOOSH - As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward 
	Big Dan, frozen, looking up.

	It crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates 
	Big Dan Teague.

	A PACKARD

	It is pulling up in front of a town hall from which party 
	sounds filter out.

	Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the car with his retinue - Eckard, 
	Spivey and Junior.

				PAPPY
		I'm sayin' we har this man away.

				ECKARD
		Assa good idea, Pappy.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva idea.

				ECKARD
		Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

				SPIVEY
		Have him join us, run our campaign 
		'stead a that pencil-neck's.

				ECKARD
		Enticements a power, wealth, settera.

				SPIVEY
		No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

				ECKARD
		Oh gracious no. Not with his 
		blandishments.

				SPIVEY
		Powas p'suasion.

				PAPPY
		What's his name again?

				ECKARD
		Campaign manager? Waldrip.

				SPIVEY
		Vernon Waldrip.

				ECKARD
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				PAPPY
		Hmm... His folks from out Tuscarora?

				SPIVEY
		Tuscarora? Might be. I b'lieve they 
		is.

				ECKARD
		Not a doubt in my mind.

	Pappy is disgusted:

				PAPPY
		You don't know where his goddamn 
		folks from; you speakin' outcha 
		asshole.

				ECKARD
		Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it 
		that strong...

	As the three men make their way up the steps, Eckard's voice 
	is fading:

				ECKARD
		...but p'haps yaw right...

	In wide shot, they disappear into the building.

	A reverse shows the wide shot to have been the point-of-view 
	of Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy, who peek out from the 
	mouth of an alley. Everett hisses his intelligence:

				EVERETT
		Well, it's a invitation-only affair; 
		we'll have to sneak in through the 
		service entrance-

				PETE
		Wait a minute - who elected you leader 
		a this outfit? Since we been followin' 
		your lead we got nothin' but trouble! 
		I gotten this close to bein' strung 
		up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped 
		no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

				DELMAR
		'N turned into a frog -

				EVERETT
		He was never turned into a frog!

	Delmar sulks:

				DELMAR
		Almost loved up though.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		So you're against me now, too!... Is 
		that how it is, boys?

	Silence. No one wants to meet Everett's eye. He is saddened.

				EVERETT
		The whole world and God Almighty... 
		and now you. Well, maybe I deserve 
		this. Boys, I... I know I've made 
		some tactical mistakes. But if you'll 
		just stick with me; I need your help. 
		And I've got a plan.  Believe me, 
		boys, we can fix this thing! I can 
		get my wife back! We can get outta 
		here!

	Headlights play; the men suck back into the alley as a car 
	passes by.

	The car tools up to the banquet hall and Homer Stokes emerges 
	with his midget. The midget tosses his balled-up white hood 
	into the car and both men shrug into their suitcoats.

	Stokes is angry:

				STOKES
		...goddamn disgrace. Made a travesty 
		of the entire evenin'...

	They too start up the stairs. Stokes's pace is brisk and the 
	midget hops awkwardly to keep up.

				STOKES
		...what I wouldn't give to get my 
		hands on those agitators. Whoever 
		heard a such behavior. Even among 
		culluds. Or mulattos, maybe - I 
		suspect some miscegenation in their 
		heritage... how else you goin' explain 
		it - usin' the Confed'it flag as a 
		missile...

	BANQUET HALL KITCHEN

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are entering through the 
	back door. The blackface has been scrubbed off but all four 
	now wear long gray beards as disguise, clumsily affixed with 
	spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case.

	They elbow past the bustling kitchen help.

				EVERETT
		Scuse me... scuse me... we're the 
		next act...

				DELMAR
		Everett, my beard itches.

				PETE
		This is crazy. No one's ever gonna 
		believe we're a real band.

				EVERETT
		No, this is gonna work! I just gotta 
		get close enough to talk to her. 
		Takin' off with us is got a lot more 
		future in it than marrying a guy 
		named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona 
		fide. I've got the answers!

	HEAD TABLE

	Out in the banquet hall Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side 
	at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals. Penny and 
	Waldrip are facing the hall with their backs to the stage as 
	the four bearded band members - Everett, Pete, Delmar and 
	Tommy - take their places.

	Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair with an arm draped 
	over his shoulder, leaning in to murmur confidentially.  
	Waldrip sits stiffly erect as he listens, frowning at a spot 
	in space.

	Suddenly Waldrip erupts:

				WALDRIP
		Well that's a improper suggestion!  
		I can't switch sides in the middle 
		of a campaign!  Especially to work 
		for a man who lacks moral fibre!

				PAPPY
		Moral fibre?!

	He waves his cane, outraged.

				PAPPY
		You pasty-faced sonofabitch, I 
		invented moral fibre!

	Up on the stage, the band has launched into a song.

				PAPPY
		Pappy O'Daniel was displayin' 
		rectitude and high-mindedness when 
		that pencil-neck you work for was 
		still messin' his drawers!

	A hissed Voice:

				VOICE
		Psst! Penny! Hey! Up here!

	As the two men continue to exchange sharp words, penny turns 
	her head to look steeply up over her shoulder.

	Everett is up onstage just behind her. As the rest of the 
	band continues to play, he is parting his beard to hiss down 
	at her:

				EVERETT
		Penny! It's me!

	Dismayed, she shakes her head and tries to unobtrusively 
	wave him away. He is undeterred:

				EVERETT
		No, Penny, listen! We're leavin' the 
		state! Pusuin' opportunities in 
		another venue! I got big plans! Not 
		minstrelsy; this-here's just a dodge - 
		I'm gonna be a dentist! I know a guy 
		who'll print me up a license! I wanna 
		be what you want me to be, honey! I 
		want you and the gals to come with 
		me!

	She shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate 
	as Everett continues pleading to her back:

				EVERETT
		They're my daughters, Penny! I'm the 
		king a this goddamn castle!

	Stokes has ambled up to the head table.

				STOKES
		What're you doin' here, Pappy? I 
		guess someone let on there was free 
		liquor, heh-heh.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, you'll be laughin' out the 
		other side your face come November.

				ECKARD
		Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.

				SPIVEY
		Not out the other side his face, 
		though.

				ECKARD
		Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -

	This byplay is interrupted by a roar from the crowd.

	The band has launched into 'Man of Constant Sorrow', 
	precipitating the huge reaction. Everett, still trying to 
	get Penny's attention, looks up, stunned at the ovation.

	Cry from the crowd:

				VOICE
		Hot damn! Itsa Soggy Bottom Boys!

	Everett and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. 
	A shrug, and they lean into the song with a will.

	Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the 
	crowd to new heights of hysteria.

				PAPPY
		Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!

				JUNIOR
		But Pappy, they's inter-grated.

				PAPPY
		Well I guess folks don't mind they's 
		integrated.

	Stokes is also staring at the band, frowning. He murmurs to 
	himself:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute...

	Everett catches Stokes' look. The two men look at each other, 
	aghast.

	Stokes raises his voice accusingly:

				STOKES
		...you's miscegenated! All you boys!  
		Miscegenated!

	Everett raises the volume of his singing. Stokes cries out:

				STOKES
		Get me a mike-a-phone!

	A mike is thrust into his hand and he bellows into it, 
	overwhelming the music, which the boys eventually abandon. 
	Stokes continues bellowing into the silence:

				STOKES
		These boys is not white! These boys 
		is not white! Hell, they ain't even 
		ol'-timey! I happen to know, ladies'n 
		gentlemen, this band a miscreants 
		here, this very evening, they 
		interfered with a lynch mob inna 
		performance of its duties!

	The crowd stares at him, stone-faced. Stokes plows on:

				STOKES
		It's true! I b'long to a certain 
		society, I don't believe I gotta 
		mention its name, heh-heh...

	Nobody joins in the laugh; Stokes slowly strangles on it.

				STOKES
		...Ahem. And these boys here trampled 
		all over our venerated observances 
		an' rich'ls!  Now this-here music is 
		over! I aim to -

	Boos start up among the crowd.

				STOKES
		I aim to hand these boys over to - 
		listen to me, folks!

	The boos are growing in volume. There are cries of 'More 
	music!' and even one 'Shut up, pencil-neck!'

				STOKES
		Listen to me! These boys desecrated 
		a fiery cross!

	More boos. Waldrip approaches and nudges the microphone away 
	to murmur confidentially in Stokes' ear. Stokes excitedly 
	retrieves the mike and struggles to be heard:

				STOKES
		And they convicts! Fugitives, folks, 
		escaped off the farm!

	This cuts no ice; the boos have become overwhelming.

				STOKES
		Folks, these boys gotta be remanded 
		the 'thorities! Criminals! And I 
		happen to have it from the highest 
		authority that that Neegra sold his 
		soul to the devil!

	He is hit by a tomato.

	The boos are deafening; the Soggy Bottom Boys, sensing 
	opportunity, launch back into the interrupted verse of 'Man 
	of Constant Sorrow'. The boos become wild cheers.

	Stokes is being pelted by foodstuffs. Shielding himself with 
	one arm, he bellows into the mike:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Is you 
		is or is you ain't my constichency?

	INT. RUSTIC CABIN

	Far up some sleepy holler. An old man in overalls and his 
	wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny 
	voice. They look at each other wordlessly, look back at the 
	crystal set.

	BACK TO BANQUET HALL

	Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks 
	apprehensively on.

				STOKES
		Is you is or is you ain't -

	A disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug; 
	Stokes continues to mouth the inaudible words.

	Pappy is considering the crowd.

				PAPPY
		Goddamn! Oppitunity knocks!

	He starts clambering up onto the stage.

	Two men advance through the clapping audience holding high 
	either end of an eight-foot rail. When they reach Stokes, 
	other audience members help load him onto the rail.

	Onstage, Pappy claps along with the audience.

	As they play, the band members fearfully eye Pappy, who 
	advances on them.

	Pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and 
	does a little two-step. The audience roars. The band relaxes, 
	performing with even more gusto.

	Stokes is being through the crowd on the rail, jeered at and 
	pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit.

	As the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars 
	approval, and Pappy elbows in to the microphone, beaming.

				PAPPY
		That's fine, that's fine!...

	He drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar.

				PAPPY
		...Ladies'n gentlemens here and 
		listenin' at home, the great state 
		of Mississippi (Pappy O'Daniel, 
		Gov'nor) thanks the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys for that won-a-ful performance!

	Cheers.

				PAPPY
		Now it looks like the only man in 
		our great state who ain't a music 
		luvva, is my esteemed opponent in 
		the upcomin', Homer Stokes -

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, well, they ain't no accountin' 
		f'taste. It sounded t'me like he 
		harbored some kind a hateful grudge 
		against the Soggy Bottom Boys on 
		account a their rough'n rowdy past.

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Sounds like Homer Stokes is the kinda 
		fella gonna cast the first stone!

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Well I'm with you folks. I'm a f'give 
		and f'get Christian. And I say, well, 
		if their rambunctiousness and 
		misdemeanorin' is behind 'em - It 
		is, ain't it, boys?

	Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going.

				EVERETT
		Sure is, Governor.

				PAPPY
		Why then I say, by the par vested in 
		me, these boys is hereby pardoned!

	Loud cheers prod Pappy to another level of inspiration:

				PAPPY
		And furthermore, in the second Pappy 
		O'Daniel administration, why, these 
		boys - is gonna be my brain trust!

	Raucous cheers.

	The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried:

				DELMAR
		What sat mean exactly, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are 
		gonna be the power behind the throne 
		so to speak.

				DELMAR
		Oh, okay.

				PAPPY
		So now, without further ado, and by 
		way of endorsin' my candidacy, the 
		Soggy Bottom Boys is gonna lead us 
		all in a chorus of 'You Are My 
		Sunshine' - ain't ya, boys?

	He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for 
	a considering beat.

				EVERETT
		...Governor - that's one of our 
		favorites!

	Pappy returns a considered appraisal:

				PAPPY
		Son, you gonna go far.

	The song begins.

	LATER

	The steps of the meeting hall. People stream out of the 
	concert into the warm summer night.

	Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps 
	with Penny.

				EVERETT
		I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna 
		be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be 
		able to throw a little patronage his 
		way, get the man a job diggin' ditches 
		or rounding up stray dogs.

				DELMAR
		Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

				PENNY
		McGill. No, the marriage'll take 
		place as planned.

				EVERETT
		Just a little change of cast. Me and 
		the little lady are gonna pick up 
		the pieces'n retie the knot, 
		mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're 
		invited, of course. Hell, you're 
		best men! Already got the rings.

	He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their 
	wedding bands - but Penny's finger is bare.

				EVERETT
		Where's your ring, honey?

				PENNY
		I ain't worn it since our divorce 
		came through. It must still be in 
		the rolltop in the old cabin. Never 
		thought I'd need it; Vernon bought 
		one encrusted with jewels.

				EVERETT
		Hell, now's the time to buy it off 
		him cheap.

				PENNY
		We ain't gettin' married with his 
		ring!  You said you'd changed!

				EVERETT
		Aw, honey, our ring is just a old 
		pewter thing -

				PENNY
		Ain't gonna be no weddin'.

				EVERETT
		It's just a symbol, honey -

				PENNY
		No weddin'.

				DELMAR
		We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar -
		it's just -

				PENNY
		I have spoken my piece and counted 
		to three.

	She walks off.

				EVERETT
		Oh, goddamnit! She counted to three!  
		Sonofabitch! You know how far that 
		cabin is?!

	His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession 
	on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a 
	man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being 
	escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their 
	nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation.

	Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the 
	last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar 
	cries out:

				DELMAR
		George!

	It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his 
	heavy restraints.

				GEORGE
		'Lo, boys! Well, these little men 
		finally caught up with the criminal 
		a the century! Looks like the chair 
		for George Nelson. Yup! Gonna 
		electrify me!  I'm gonna go off like 
		a Roman candle!  Twenty thousand 
		volts chasin' the rabbit through 
		yours truly! Gonna shoot sparks out 
		the top of my head and lightning 
		from my fingertips!

	As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder:

				GEORGE
		Yessir! Gonna suck all the power 
		right outa the state! Goddamn, boys, 
		I'm on top of the world! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go.

				DELMAR
		Looks like George is right back on 
		top again.

	BLACK

	In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer, 
	slobberier.

	A crack of light. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being 
	nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout.

	As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed 
	with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, 
	several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	PINEY WOODS

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods.

				EVERETT
		Well, at least you boys'll get to 
		see the old manse - the home where I 
		spent so many happy days in the bosom 
		of my family - a refugium, if you 
		will - with a mighty oak tree out 
		front and a happy little tire swing...

	They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. 
	It is indeed a peaceful-looking haven with a mighty oak tree 
	in front. There is, however, no tire swing; instead, three 
	nooses hang from one stout limb.

				DELMAR
		Where's the happy little tire swing?

	Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and 
	push them forward.

	Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-
	dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough 
	pine coffin.

	The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the 
	porch, the drooling hound at his heels.

				COOLEY
		End of the road, boys. It's had its 
		twists and turns -

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		- but now it deposits you here.

	The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three 
	gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from 
	the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas 
	round their necks.

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		You have eluded fate - and eluded me - 
		for the last time. Tie their hands, 
		boys.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this -

				COOLEY
		Didn't know you'd be bringin' a 
		friend.  Well, he'll have to wait 
		his turn -

				EVERETT
		Hang on there -

				COOLEY
		- and share one of your graves.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this - we just been 
		pardoned!  By the Governer himself!

				DELMAR
		It went out over the radio!

				COOLEY
		Is that right?

	The leering goons, who have been lashing the men's wrists 
	behind their backs, pause, their sadism stymied. They look 
	to Cooley for guidance.

	So too does the drooling hound.

	Silence.

	Finally:

				COOLEY
		...Too bad we don't have a radio.

	The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy 
	task.

	The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their 
	shovels. They begin to sing a slow and dirgelike 'You've Got 
	to Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens on them and 
	trickles down their faces like tears.

				PETE
		God have Mercy!

				TOMMY
		It ain't fittin'!

				EVERETT
		It ain't the law!

				COOLEY
		The law. Well the law is a human 
		institution.

	Cooley gives the faintest smile.

				COOLEY
		Perhaps you should take a moment for 
		your prayers.

				PETE
		Oh my God! Everett!

				DELMAR
		I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

				PETE
		Good Lord, what do we do?

	Pete is in tears. Tommy is terrified. Delmar bows his head 
	to silently pray.

	Everett bows his head as well. He murmurs:

				EVERETT
		Oh Lord, please look down and 
		recognize us poor sinners... please 
		Lord...

	The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell.

				EVERETT
		...I just want to see my daughters 
		again.  Oh Lord, I've been separated 
		from my family for so long...

	The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more 
	palpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of 
	the earth itself.

				EVERETT
		...I know I've been guilty of pride 
		and sharp dealing. I'm sorry that I 
		turned my back on you, Lord. Please 
		forgive me, and help us, Lord, and I 
		swear I'll mend my ways... For the 
		sake of my family... For Tommy's 
		sake, and Delmar's, and Pete's...

	The rumble is building.

				EVERETT
		...Let me see my daughters again. 
		Please, Lord, help us... Please help 
		us...

	The rumble erupts into a deafening roar.

	A wall of water is crashing through the hollow.

	It engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is 
	ripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their 
	feet and all is noise and confusion.

	UNDERWATER

	A silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural 
	slow motion.

	Suspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family 
	portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a 
	frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically 
	paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it.

	FURTHER DOWNHILL

	The churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly 
	created river, fast-moving but no longer violent.

	After a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is 
	broken by the up-bob of a pine coffin.

	The coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett 
	pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking 
	his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish 
	freeing himself from the rope round his wrists.

	Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air.

	The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. 
	Dazed, they look around.

	The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or 
	treetop poking out of the newly formed river. All is quiet 
	except for the gurgle of water.

				DELMAR
		A miracle! It was a miracle!

				EVERETT
		Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I 
		told you they was gonna flood this 
		valley.

				DELMAR
		That ain't it!

				PETE
		We prayed to God and he pitied us!

				EVERETT
		It just never fails; once again you 
		two hayseeds are showin' how much 
		you want for innalect. There's a 
		perfectly scientific explanation for 
		what just happened -

				PETE
		That ain't the tune you were singin' 
		back there at the gallows!

				EVERETT
		Well any human being will cast about 
		in a moment of stress. No, the fact 
		is, they're flooding this valley so 
		they can hydro-electric up the whole 
		durned state...

	Everett waxes smug:

				EVERETT
		Yessir, the South is gonna change.  
		Everything's gonna be put on 
		electricity and run on a payin' basis. 
		Out with the old spiritual mumbo-
		jumbo, the superstitions and the 
		backward ways. We're gonna see a 
		brave new world where they run 
		everyone a wire and hook us all up 
		to a grid. Yessir, a veritable age 
		of reason - like the one they had in 
		France - and not a moment too soon...

	His voice trails off as he notices something.

	A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its 
	eaves. A cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring 
	at Everett, who returns the stare.

	He shakes off the vision and clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Not a moment too soon. Say, there's 
		Tommy!

	Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a 
	half-submerged piece of furniture.

				EVERETT
		What you ridin' there, Tommy?

	The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current 
	and, to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place 
	like a hamster on a wheel. As the chest exposes its ribbed 
	upper half:

				TOMMY
		Rolltop desk...

	STREET

	Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals 
	behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk.

				EVERETT
		All's well that ends well, as the 
		poet says.

				PENNY
		That's right, honey.

				EVERETT
		But I don't mind telling you, I'm 
		awful pleased my adventuring days is 
		at an end...

	He fumbles in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		...Time for this old boy to enjoy 
		some repose.

				PENNY
		That's good, honey.

				EVERETT
		And you were right about that ring. 
		Any other weddin' band would not do. 
		But this-here was foreordained, honey; 
		fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya 
		have to have confidence -

	He is slipping it onto her hand.

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		- in the gods - Huh?

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		Not your...

				PENNY
		That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

				EVERETT
		You said it was in the rolltop desk!

				PENNY
		I said I thought it was in the rolltop 
		desk.

				EVERETT
		You said -

				PENNY
		Or, it might a been under the 
		mattress.

				EVERETT
		You -

				PENNY
		Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

	Everett shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		Well, I'm sorry honey -

				PENNY
		Well, we need that ring.

				EVERETT
		Well now honey, that ring is at the 
		bottom of a pretty durned big lake.

				PENNY
		Uh-huh.

				EVERETT
		A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.

				PENNY
		I don't care if it's ninety thousand.

				EVERETT
		Yes, but honey -

				PENNY
		That wasn't my doing...

	Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two 
	are pulling forward out of frame.

				EVERETT
		Course not, honey, but...

	We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, 
	still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we 
	can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal.

	The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of 
	string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and 
	Everett, off:

				PENNY
		I counted to three, honey.

				EVERETT
		Well sure, honey, but...

	We reach the end of the piece of string; it is wrapped around 
	the waist of the toddler, who lingers in frame. She gazes 
	down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open 
	field.

				EVERETT
		...finding one little ring in the 
		middle of all that water...

	His voice, and that of the singing girls, recedes.

				EVERETT
		...that is one hell of a heroic 
		task...

	The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of 
	frame.

	A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The rhythmic 
	clack is from the hand-pumped flatcar.

	The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing 
	harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.

	THE END
OBLIVION

          1.

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. THE PLANET - MORNING

          Huge mountains, destroyed STRUCTURES. Buildings
          enveloped by flows of earth. Awe-inspiring beauty.

                    JACK (V.O.)
          They arrived almost half a century
          ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you
          want to call them. Their idea of
          how-do-you-do was to blow up our
          moon.

          Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and
          concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand.

                    JACK (V.O.)
          Without her moon, the earth went
          insane. Most were killed in the
          floods, as the cities came down,
          as everything caught fire. A year
          later their ground troops landed,
          to exterminate whoever was left.
          A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A
          child's plastic flip-flops on the dash.

                    JACK (V.0.)
          They were probably surprised, what
          we were willing to do, to survive.
          We used the nukes.

                         (BEAT)
          We won the war, but lost the
          planet.

          Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a
          WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles
          the earth once a day, like an artificial moon.

                    JACK (V.0.)
          Humanity had to flee the Earth.
          We had to unlearn what it meant,
          to call something our home. Now
          we live on the Tet, our man-made
          moon. A temporary home before the
          next step. Everyone's there now.

                         (BEAT)
          Well, almost everyone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          INT. BEDROOOM - MORNING

          An ALARM chirps. A man's hand reaches out of bed,
          silences it. The MAN swings his feet onto the floor. He
          sits with his face in his hands, waking up. We hear a
          SHOWER RUNNING. He looks up.
          A WOMAN showers near him, only steamed glass walls
          between them. She sees him, smiles at him, without
          modesty. He looks back at her.
          OVER TITLES. We watch a familiar morning routine:

          INT. A HOME - MORNING

          BATHROOM. The man flicks on a light, stares at himself
          in the mirror. This is JACK. Early 40's, a good face
          that enjoys rugged living. Tan and weathered skin. His
          eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like.
          The woman squeezes in next to him, VICTORIA. 30s, a tom-
          boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck. She
          brushes her teeth.

          KITCHEN. Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast.
          SHOWER. Jack lets warm water blast him in the face.
          READY ROOM. Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit
          from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's
          of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech
          corridor, smiling eager at the camera. He stares at it
          for a moment, closes the locker door.
          KITCHEN. Victoria hands Jack his coffee. He kisses the
          top of her head, heads out to work.

          EXT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS

          He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched
          1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As
          our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass-
          walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross
          between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we
          CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking
          down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into
          his ship.

          TITLE CARD: "OBLIVION"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          EXT. THE SKY - DAY

          The SKY stretches to infinity above roiling planetary
          cloud-cover. The BUBBLESHIP streaks through our frame,
          dropping faster than free fall.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Through the canopy of the Bubbleship: The cloud cover
          below seems to FALL UPWARDS at us, that's how fast we're
          diving. There's a small worn BOBBLE-HEAD on the dash
          which vibrates with the ship.
          Jack is un-phased by the drop, touches a few controls.

          VICTORIA (V.O.)
          Good morning, Jack. I'll be your
          flight attendant for the day.
          This is day... three thousand two
          hundred and twenty five, in case
          you were wondering.
          JACK is running instruments. A day at work..

                         VICTORIA
          Today we will be running support
          on five Resource Gatherers working
          the seaboard. Coordinates coming
          to you... now. Please do confirm.
          On Jack's heads-up display, five icons glow to life.

                         JACK
          Yeah, I got 'em. You got 'em,
          Bob?
          The Bobblehead bobs.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          VICTORIA watches the Bubbleship's icon on a screen.
          She's now wearing a work jumpsuit open over a man's
          undershirt. She has a natural ease with tech and stress.
          She sips her coffee, punches up a feed, multi-tasking
          with cool.

                         VICTORIA
          Drone perimeter defense is intact,
          although one went offline last
          night. How's the drop?

          Oh, you know. Same ole' same.
          In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of
          technological advances. Most prominent a MAP overlaid
          with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels...
          Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship.

                         VICTORIA
          Alright, you're blind in five,
          four, three...
          INTERCUT WITH JACK IN THE BUBBLESHIP. JACK watches the
          cloud wall RUSH UP at him.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Two... one...

                         JACK
          You should come with me sometime.

                         VICTORIA
          No, thank you. Have a nice ride.
          The Bubbleship HITS CLOUDS, goes completely blind. Just
          vapor and water HAMMERING the canopy like bullets.
          On the heads-up display, GPS numbers roll. The readouts
          deal with climate, terrain below... Even in this hell,
          Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments.
          One of Victoria's boards flashes. She squints as a large
          MASS forms near Jack's ship.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Jack, you got some weather on your
          five, closing.
          The Bubbleship is VIBRATING, buffeted.

                         JACK
          What do you call this?
          What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this.
          The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from
          behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up.
          Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning
          lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          (humming to himself)
          "I've got sunshine...

          on a cloudy day. When it's cold
          outside I've got the month of
          May..."
          Victoria watches the readouts, helpless.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

                         (STILL SINGING)
          "I guess you'd say... What can
          make me feel this way?"
          (a little tense)
          Okay, Bob. Need you to work with
          me here.
          In the Bubbleship, Jack works the display, literally
          SMACKS a panel with his fist. Suddenly, the Bubbleship
          SURGES with power. Jack regains control as:

          INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          The Bubbleship BURSTS through low clouds, hurtling down
          past turbulence into...
          THE SKY ABOVE A BEAUTIFUL DESOLATE PLANET. Mysterious
          black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and
          gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich
          brown craters.
          Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all.

                         JACK
          (under his breath)
          "Talkin' 'bout my girl..."
          Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of
          RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic
          vacuums, sucking up the oceans.
          In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers,
          and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One
          blinks, stalled.

                         VICTORIA
          Okay, we've got another Drone
          downed last night.

                         JACK
          Send it.
          NUMBERS FIRE across the heads-up. Jack touches a button.
          A BAR GAUGE begins to fill, like a street racer turning
          on the NOX before dragging...

          Would you like to set a course to

                         (SMALL SMILE)
          Absolutely not.
          Bar gaucre hits top. Jack punches it.
          JACK vibrates in his seat, pinned back. The ship SCREAMS
          over the surface, following the signal.
          Now A HUGE CRATER opens up in front of him which he DROPS
          INTO, barely missing an edge... which seems to have
          architecture to it.
          The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed
          to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in
          sand. We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey.
          Old news to Jack. He surveys below...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I see it, looks like full mid-
          flight impact. What was its last
          destination?
          BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical
          mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand.

                         VICTORIA
          Yo no se. No data. It's not
          transmitting.
          (checking the map)
          Tet coverage will go live in 11
          minutes.
           Jack stares forward at a huge broken sign: "Home of the
          2015 World Champions..."

                         JACK
          You know, I actually read about
          this game. Giants are literally
          on their own seven with 25 seconds
          on the clock...

                         VICTORIA
          Please do not reminisce on my
          Comm, thank you very much.
          He puts the Bubbleship into a soft descent. Victoria
          observes it on her console.

          Negative, technician. I have no
          eyes in the sky for another ten
          minutes. Do not land.
          SEEN FROM INSIDE A STADIUM TUNNEL: The bubbleship lands
          thirty yards from the Drone, moors itself by setting
          spikes from its skids. Blowing sand whips around both.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          JACK grabs an old YANKEES CAP from between the seats and
          slides it on backwards. He hoists a WEAPON, a carbine-
          sized gun on a sling, and checks its charge as he slides
          the door open. He's BLASTED with sand and wind which now
          suddenly still, like a freight train that's passed.

                         JACK
          Anyway... QB lets off this mile-
          high bomb...
          The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts
          moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding
          it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on
          earth...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          The thing just sails the length of
          the field.
          Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's
          "vision" still not covering Jack's location.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack I have no scope. The Tet is
          still offline.
          He pauses. A faint sound on the wind... like a whine.

                         JACK
          And at the one yard line...
          interception. Devastation. It's
          all over.

          EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

          LIGHTS connected to the ship's two AUTOMATIC GUNS reach
          from the hull of the BUBBLESHIP, backlighting JACK as he
          reaches the downed drone.

                         CONTINUED:
          THE DRONE, a spectacular piece of technology, has landed
          hard, half-buried in the sand. The basic electronics are
          still humming, cycling.

                         JACK
          But the guy's too eager. He
          starts running it back.
          Everyone's yelling "Fall down,
          just fall down!"
          Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly
          locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          Huh... The fuel-cell has been
          taken.

                         VICTORIA
          What do you mean taken? Was it a
          malfunction?
          Jack looks at the casing... beaten, pried open? He
          glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels.
          REVERSE ANGLE. From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance,
          Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack...

                         JACK
          No... It's a master drone, too.
          166. Looks like it was hit mid
          flight, managed to limp its way
          here. Watch my back, I'm starting
          field repair.
          INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of
          the Tet's vision - still six minutes away.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          Bob, I'm going to need a cell.
          AT THE BUBBLESHIP. An exterior compartment opens
          revealing spare parts, etc... At the same time, a small
          ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from
          the ship, sprouting wheels...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, you need to get out of
          there. Bring it home to the shop.
          Jack has a panel open. He pulls a lead from the sleeve
          of his suit, connects it to a board. We see FLIGHT DATA
          transfer to the Bubbleship.

          Ball goes loose...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, you know they can weaponize
          a fuel cell.
          Now a DRIVER shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit.

                         JACK

                         (STARTING WORK)
          And wouldn't you know it, Giants
          recover, start running it back.
          Total insanity.

                         VICTORIA
          I'm reading the whole central core
          off alignment, you don't have the
          necessary tools.
          Jack's got an arm and half his chest inside. He takes
          his CHEWING GUM, presses it in next to a board...
          Systems go green on Victoria's console.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Hold on, what did you just do?

                         JACK
          (calling to the ship)
          Bob, I said I needed...
          He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a
          DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay.
          A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain?
          Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A
          HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online.
          Jack looks around at the stadium.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Can you imagine it? 80,000 people
          on their feet. Everyone yelling
          "Go! Go! Go!..." Touchdown...
          He sets his gun against the Drone, raises his arms,
          running in a circle, making the crowd roar sound...

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          INTERCUT VICTORIA: Listening to his stadium cheer sound
          over the Comm. She rests her head in her hands.
          WITH JACK. The empty ruined structure stares back.
          Reality returns, sadly...
          He reaches for the open Fuel Cell door... hesitates,
          hating what comes next... and that SOUND comes again.
          Distinctive. An animal's whimper...

          INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack stands at the tunnel entrance, shining a light into
          the depths. The sound is clear now, a low WHIMPERING.
          Jack makes his way down the tunnel, carefully. Ahead,
          the tunnel meets the circular tunnel that rings the
          stadium. His light plays over the silty floor, finds:
          A DOG. Starving, shivering. It COWERS in a corner.

                         JACK
          Hey there, boy. Easy...
          Jack moves forward, hand out.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          You got nothing to be scared of,
          buddy...
          The dog suddenly SCURRIES away into the dark
          BEHIND JACK, a HUGE FORM RISES. We see GREY SKIN,
          TEETH... and Jack hears ITS HEAVY LABORED BREATH...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Ah, shi...
          JACK SPRINTS, full speed! The animal, A GIANT EMACIATED
          HAIRLESS BEAR, comes SURGING out of the darkness,
          lumbering after him.
          Jack TEARS back down the tunnel, the bear's form almost
          FILLING the tunnel behind him.

          EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

          We HEAR JACK before we see him. A loud "AHHHHHHHH'.!!!!"
          as Jack comes STREAKING out of the tunnel, the bear on
          his heels.

           VIEW FROM ABOVE: Jack streaks down the field, 50, 40,
          30.. The giant bear closing...
          WITH JACK. He can see the drone in front of him, the
          Fuel Cell Door still hanging open. He puts on a burst of
          speed but STUMBLES, sliding on his chest, arm
          outstretched towards the Drone as the bear LEAPS!
          He REACHES, flips the Drone's fuel cell door shut.
          Drone 166 REACTIVATES. It SURGES UP, weapons POWERING UP
          and RRRRRRRRRRRRip!! It opens up with white plasma fire
          on the bear which seems to go nova in mid air,
          disintegrating to BLACK ASH which covers Jack.
          Jack stumbles to his feet. Drone 166 NOW WHEELS ON HIM.
           Its smoking red-hot cannons inches from his face.
          JACK averts his gaze as the Drone SCANS Jack. Breathing
          hard, hating this moment. With its ganglia still hanging
          out, it doesn't seem to be processing... And then just as
          quickly, the Drone rockets up into the sky and is gone.
          Jack falls to his knees in the sand, exhausted. Only now
          realizing that Victoria has been calling his name.

                         VICTORIA
          Jesus, Jack. What the hell was
          that?
          INTERCUT VICTORIA. The Tet's scanners finally giving her
          a high-rez thermal view of Jack. Her display burning red
          from the residual plasma fire.

                         JACK

                         (SPITTING ASH)
          Call in number 166 for service up
          top. It's practically got its
          motherboard and half its
          hydraulics hanging out.
          (under his breath)
          But it still wants to kill
          everybody...

          Jack, what happened?
          Nowtrudging to the ship:

                         JACK
          I'll see you at the house later.
          You want anything? Milk? Bread?
          Anything else that doesn't exist?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         VICTORIA
          You.
          He leans against the ship. Smiles tired. It's a nice
          thing to hear.

                         JACK
          Well if you want anybody else,
          you're out of luck.
          He boards the BUBBLESHIP.

                         VICTORIA
          We only have two more months,
          Jack. Please try to resist the
          urge to do something stupid.

                         (BEAT)
          There's no other service signals.
          Come home.
          ON VICTORIA. A relationship off balance. She wants him
          home. He wants...

                         JACK
          No...
          ON JACK. The captured Drone data right there in front of
          him on the heads-up. He's too curious.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          That Master Drone was hit right
          over mid-town. Same area as the
          one we lost last night.

          EXT. HILLSIDE -- LATER

          JACK'S BUBBLESHIP, locked and armed, sits atop a ridge,
          against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky.
          Jack SCANS the horizon with his BINOCS, past deserted
          landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down
          semi-intact on its side. Nothing.
          He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the
          HUGE RESOURCE GATHERERS blots out half the sky, breath-
          taking. It's hovering over what is left of a subsided
          harbor, a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships. The
          water level has dropped by a kilometer.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Gatherer is sucking up salt water, harvesting the
          elements essential to create DEUTERIUM, "Heavy Hydrogen."
          At the top of the giant machine, Drones work tirelessly,
          ferrying containers of Deuterium energy up into the sky.
          Jack raises the Binocs, snaps a few photographs...

                         VICTORIA
          There's no Drone signal there.

                         (BEAT)
          What are you doing, Jack?

                         JACK
          One day when we get to Mars,
          someone will want to know about
          this. From someone who was here.
          He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Do we have to take it all?

                         VICTORIA
          It's not doing anyone any good
          here.
          JACK nods, starts to turn away when something GLINTS on
          the horizon. He raises the Binocs, PANS to a gallows-
          like structure. He ZOOMS, but it is still unclear.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Jack, without a signal, you're
          looking for a needle in a
          haystack. I think we've had
          enough excitement for one day.
          JACK is at the back of the Bubbleship, throwing levers.

                         JACK
          Actually I've got a bit of a
          problem with a gyro here, call you
          when I've fixed it.
          He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from
          a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working
          expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE.
          As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to
          life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster-
          tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         CONTINUED: ( 2)
          JACK rides over what used to be the sea-bed, soaking up
          the thrill of catching top speed air over embankments of
          black sand. Completely carefree, enjoying himself like a
          man who is utterly and completely alone.

          EXT. SINK HOLE - DAY

          Something was here. A large metal beam has been propped
          onto rocks, stretching over... a COLLAPSED SECTION OF
          EARTH. This was the source of the light reflection.
          Jack stares down into the hole... black. He POPS a
          flare, drops it in. It comes to rest far below, next to
          the unmistakable form of a DRONE.

                         JACK
          .There you are.
          An instant of BLACK...
          And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN
          BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing.
          Something is watching him.

          INT. SINK HOLE - DAY

          Inside the hole, looking up. A CLIMBING ROPE spills
          towards camera.
          We descend with Jack, all the way down into the hole, the
          light receding above. He touches his suit and a light
          array blazes on, illuminating the walls passing by.

          INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

          Jack drops down through what used to be a roof... into
          the READING ROOM OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY. Vast,
          ruined, the far end totally collapsed, like a sky-scraper
          fell on it. He reaches the silty floor, the flare's
          burning light illuminating the room.
          He STARES at the expanse of SHELVES that line the walls,
          stripped and empty. Wonder... and disappointment.
          He turns to his task, kneels by the Drone. The thing's a
          wreck. A METAL SHAFT protrudes from a crease. Jack
          marvels at the accuracy of the shot...
          He carefully reaches out, slides the fuel cell door open.
          Again, the FUEL CELL is missing.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         JACK
          Vika, you're not going to
          believe...
          WHITE NOISE on the comm. There's no signal down here.

          EXT. HILLSIDE -- CONTINUOUS

          The static BUBBLESHIP sits inert.

           VICTORIA ON THE COMM
          Jack? Jack... ?

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria, worried. Finally, she turns to the TET COMM.
          A station reserved for high-tech, long-range
          communication with the home base. A STATUS indicator,
          and a screen for text communication.

          TET COMM STATUS: "COMMUNICATION ENABLED."

                         VICTORIA
          Mission, this is Lieutenant
          Victoria Kohl, requesting Drone
          intercept at coordinates sending
          now.
          Her AUDIO goes through a SCRAMBLING PROCESS, then is
          uploaded where a few seconds later its receipt is
          acknowledged: STATUS: "APPROVED."
          She stares up at the map, sees one of the Drones turn
          towards Jack's location. She settles back, watching.

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY

          JACK looks up and sees how the Drone was brought down:
          above it is a twisted tangle of chain-mesh and cables
          strung between two structures, a DRONE TRAP.
          MOVEMENT FROM THE DARKNESS. Jack spins, his gun coming
          off his back in a fluid motion. Just the empty cavern,
          the wreckage at the end.
          Jack squints at... a wall of books on the shelves beyond
          the wreckage.

                         JACK
          .Jackpot.

          16.

                         CONTINUED:
          He steps forward... ALMOST FALLS INTO A GIANT HOLE!
          He raises the flare off the ground, illuminating a void
          where the entire floor has imploded down seven more
          stories. What's left is a PIT, with a building-sized ton
          of twisted metal hanging over it...
          A single bent GIRDER still spans the hole. Jack tracks
          the possibilities... steps out onto the girder. He
          reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance...
          IT SHIFTS! A hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an
          inch above him. Best leave that alone...
          He balances, inching across this metal tightrope.
          Finally reaching the other side...

          AT THE FAR SHELVES
          Jack approaches the wall of books, hundred of them. He
          kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: "THE

          EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS."
          He steps back, admiring it... SNAP! A BEAR TRAP hidden
          in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and
          flesh. Jack has a second to process and a cable rises
          from the debris, goes taught!
          JACK is dragged through the dust inhumanly FAST, headed
          towards a darkened alcove. He activates a LASER CUTTER
          on his cuff, slices through the cable which WHIPS AWAY as
          he brings his rifle up, FIRES rounds into the darkness.
          INHUMAN SCREAMS. Half animal, half electronic.
          Something's in pain, but not retreating, CLOSING ON HIM.
          Jack SLICES DOWN, cutting loose the claw, and RUNS FOR IT
          back towards the HOLE as his girder is yanked away in
          front of him, pulled into the void below.
          Jack doesn't slow, reaches the edge, LEAPS!
          A moment, Jack hanging in space, gravity clawing at him,
          falling... SLAMMING into the far side. For a moment
          dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the
          far side.
          ALIEN FORMS emerge from recesses. We get glimpses of
          feathers, oily flesh, metal... They CLOSE as he reaches
          his line, clips in and RISES automatically, the suit
          riding the line up at neck-snapping speed...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CONTINUED: ( 2)
          ABOVE. The line trembles under his weight and stress...
          A KNIFE, improvised from bone and sheet metal, enters the
          frame and CUTS THE LINE.
          Jack has a second to feel the slack hit. And then he's
          FALLING... IMPACTS the ground. Can't get his air.
          Staggering wildly to his feet, FORMS CLOSING...
          Suddenly a DRONE blasts down through the ceiling hole.
          Its lights turning night to day, its cannons FIRING.
          In the STROBING FLASH of canon fire, we see SCAVS
          INCINERATED. Metal and hair fry to ASH as the insect-
          like creatures SCREAM!! Other shots IMPACT WALLS. Fire
          and plaster dust fills the space.
          Jack shields himself from the debris as the Drone ceases
          firing, WHIRLS on Jack. The same awful moment as it
          SCANS him.
          Then it lifts away, is gone as quickly as it arrived.
          And with its departure, the darkness comes again.
          Silence, whatever was here is now gone.
          Jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat: The ash
          of an alien, burning paper twisting in the air. He looks
          up towards the light above. A long ways above.

          EXT. SINK HOLE - LATER

          Jack appears, dirty-faced, filthy and frustrated,
          crawling, lugging his own weight up through the sink
          hole. Finally back to the surface.
          He shakes himself off... notices his bike has been taken.

                         JACK

                         (AD-LIBBING

                         EXPLETIVES)
          That was my bike!!
          He kicks at the dust, the rocks, curses at the pain as
          he's reminded of his injured leg. He stares at the long
          walk ahead, the wall of wind and rain that now hits him,
          soaking him. He starts walking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          EXT. BUBBLESHIP - DUSK

          The debris in the air makes for spectacular sunsets.
          Jack's Bubbleship bursts from the low clouds, carrying
          Jack home after the long day. We see the "PLANETARY
          RING" formed by the rubble from the destroyed moon.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Jack marvels at the ring, thoughtful. But then checks
          his read-outs. Victoria knows what he's looking for.

                         VICTORIA
          Check your seven.
          Jack touches his controls and the Bubbleship Canopy
          REVOLVES so Jack's facing away from the direction he's
          traveling in.
          Low on the HORIZON, the TET floats in the sky. It's
          setting, glows a dull orange, like a Harvest Moon.
          INTERCUT VICTORIA. She's leaning back in her command
          chair, her feet propped on the console, also staring out
          at the Tet. Strangely quiet.
          In Jack's face a curious mixture of nostalgia, and
          confusion... This small metal planet is his home.

                         JACK
          Goodnight, folks... See you back
          here tomorrow. Same time, same
          channel...
          He punches the throttle, and screams across the tops of
          the clouds through the beautiful light, arriving at...

          EXT. SKY TOWER, LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS

          The GLASS walls of the SKY TOWER reflect the Bubbleship
          as it lands. HOOKS catch the landing rockers of the
          BUBBLESHIP and lock it down against the buffeting wind.

          INT. SHOWER - DUSK

          Jack drops the last piece of his environment suit. He
          touches a button and warm water sprays down. Through the
          glass, he can see Victoria inside the Sky Tower. She
          nods at him, a tense welcome home. He nods back. There
          is no privacy in the Sky Tower.

          19.

                         CONTINUED:
          As the glass walls go opaque with steam, he closes his
          eyes, the water running over his face. POPS OF MEMORIES
          go through his imagination:
          SKY TOWER. Early in their tour, Victoria girlishly jumps
          on the sofa with a pint of ice cream, laughing.
          BEDROOM. Also early. Jack watches Victoria sleep,
          brushes hair from her face, affectionate...
          And the memory... SEEMS TO DISTORT. Suddenly becoming:
          THE NEW YORK SKYLINE, seen through a cheap telescope.
          Jack, pulling away from the telescope, happy, turning
          to... A BRUNETTE WOMAN, staring back at him.
          Jack STARTS, snapping out of the memory.

          INT. SKY TOWER, STORAGE AREA - DUSK

          Rows and rows of shelves, mainly empty now. Jack and
          Victoria have gone through almost all of what they needed
          for a 5-year tour. Jack grabs a container of water.

          INT. SKY TOWER, READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack starts to hang up his workman's suit, pauses to
          stare at the photo of a younger him and Victoria on the
          Tet. They look so eager, so innocent.
          He shifts slightly to where he can see out to the Tet
          itself, sinking below the horizon.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, WORK AREA - DUSK

          The area is devoted to DRONE REPAIR. Lifts, parts,
          shelves, odds and ends of gear and weaponry, tables of
          tools, a written-off DRONE at the back.
           Jack comes in, glances at his newest arrival, the self-
          beached DRONE 166. Even deactivated, it looks like
           trouble, like pure evil.
          He opens a drawer, slips THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS
          into the drawer, shuts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          INT. SKY TOWER, LIVING AREA - DUSK

          We finally see the whole thing. It couldn't be more
          comfortable, although it continually vibrates in the
          wind: VICTORIA is sitting, reading her own work notes.
          In the background, Chaplin's "Modern Times" plays
          silently on a large screen.
          JACK goes up behind her and kisses her on the head.

                         VICTORIA
          (not looking at him)
          You're not supposed to bring up
          surface items.
          JACK sips water, then waits even longer before...

                         JACK
          No. I'm not supposed to bring
          them in the house.
          He's right. He exchanges his water for a glass of
          something stronger, and goes and sits down.

                         VICTORIA
          I tried to reach you earlier...
          If we're going to be an effective

                         TEAM --

                         JACK
          You're right.

                         VICTORIA
          Then you can't just --
          Jack leaps up, only to return a second later with a small
          bundle held together by an old rag. He hands it to her,
          pleased, watching her reaction.
          She opens it to reveal a small GREEN SEEDLING in a pocket
          of fresh, rich soil. Her eyes play over it...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Where did you find this?

                         JACK
          Ah-ha. So it's okay when I bring
          you something. But if I --
          She MOVES suddenly, opening one of the glass doors of the
          Sky Tower and heading outside where she holds the
          seedling away from her body, off the edge, lets it drop.

                         CONTINUED:
          She comes back in, washes her hands in the sink, upset.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Was that really necessary?

                         VICTORIA
          I know you think I'm a stickler
          for the rules, but you have no
          idea what sort of toxins could be
          in something like that.
          He chuckles...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I don't think it's
          funny.

                         JACK
          It was just a plant, Victoria.

                         VICTORIA
          That's not the point. We have two
          more months and the last thing we
          need is you putting it all at
          risk.
          He shakes his head, grimaces as he limps away.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)

                         (CONCERNED)
          You're hurt. What happened?
          He admits it with a glance, offers no explanation. She
          comes over to him, examines the wound professionally.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Come on.

          TNT. INFIRMARY BAY - DUSK
          It is tiny, but state of the art. VICTORIA seriously
          examines his wound, cleaning it out. It's no small wound
          but they're less concerned than we would be.
          Victoria pulls on gloves, opens cabinet and removes a
          watery substance as well as a small electronic wand. She
          smears the substance onto his wound, a HEALANT.

                         VICTORIA
          This is gonna pinch a little...

          Hit me.
          She activates the wand, shines ultra violet light onto
          the substance. A beat, then he BENDS OVER in pain.
          Through the healant we see the FLESH begin to knit and
          repair. Skin and sinew literally regenerating... to new.

                         VICTORIA

                         (AFFECTIONATE)
          Serves you right.
          She kisses him on the forehead, turns away.

          INT. SKY TOWER, DINING ROOM - LATER

          Wine is involved, candles. Victoria is mellower, much.
          This is a couple who knows each other's differences and
          admires them. This isn't an argument.

                         VICTORIA
          .I'm not saying you can't go
          into your caverns, I'm saying we
          have a job and if I'm trying to
          reach you and you're off on one of
          your adventures --

                         JACK
          Look, they trained me to fix
          drones. That's my job, I get
          that. But it's not what I am. I
          can't simply do the same thing
          over and over again, every day,
          with that... world down there.
          (toasts the sky)
          And if mission has a better Drone
          tech, they can get him to baby-
          sit.
          He gets up, tries out his leg. Stiff, but healed.

                         VICTORIA
          It's only a little while longer.
          The Gatherer's have collected most
          of the resources we need for Mars.
          Pretty soon --

                         JACK
          Pretty soon, there won't be
          anything left down there. No more
          plant life, no more water.

          it a little before the end.

                         VICTORIA
          You act like there's not a war
          going on down there but there is
          and we can't leave even two of
          those things alive...

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Dammit, Jack. They nearly killed
          you today.
          They eat in silence for a moment, then:

                         JACK
          Actually, it was like they were
          trying to... catch me.
          (trying to joke)
          Guess I look tasty.
          He goes over to her, puts his arms around her.

                         VICTORIA
          Please be careful. If they get to
          you, what happens to me?
          JACK puts a finger to her lips, then kisses her.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Answer the question.
          Jack considers this. Then he pulls his shirt off over
          his head. For sex?

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)

          EXT. SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

          Talk about an infinity pool. The pool is miles in the
          sky, with a glass bottom. The cold wind is constant
          overhead but heaters flare with the changes in
          temperature, compensating.
          Jack glides graceful underwater, his nude form
          silhouetted against the roiling dark clouds below. He
          surfaces near Victoria, who's stayed dressed on the edge
          with a glass of wine.

          He kisses her, steals a sip of her wine, then pushes back
          into the water, looking up at the stars, the streaming
          moon-rubble above.

                         VICTORIA
          Can you imagine when we go back
          up? Having a face to face
          conversation again? I can't
          believe it's finally ending.

                         (TOASTING HIM)
          We made it.
          Jack looks away...

                         JACK
          It's not so bad down here. They
          certainly don't have anything like
          this.

                         VICTORIA
          I wonder what duty I would have
          pulled. Probably programming the
          Mars boats.

                         JACK
          I'd have been overhauling the zero-
          G toilets.

                         (SHE LAUGHS)
          I'm serious, it's dangerous work.
          I mean, you think you have control
          of the situation.
          He swims closer. She smiles, he presses on.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          But then you realize, there are
          some things that were never
          supposed to happen in zero G.

                         VICTORIA
          Stop!

                         JACK
          It's awful. Just thinking about
          it, I get afraid...
          She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the
          glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower.
          They watch it disappear into the darkness below.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          I can't remember zero gravity.
          Physically. Can you?

                         JACK
          Here, let me show you...
          He reaches up PULLS her into the pool. She screams,
          laughing as she goes in. She surfaces, pulling her
          soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side.

                         VICTORIA
          I should have seen that coming.
          Jack smiles, then takes a breath and goes under. He
          floats face-down, staring through the bottom of the pool
          into the lightening-stung clouds below...
          .and then Victoria's form glides underneath him,
          looking up at him, smiling. She stops moving and her
          body rises towards his. He opens his arms, and she
          floats up and against him. They embrace, kiss...
          Two bodies, intertwined underwater, a thousand feet above
          a roiling thunderstorm.
          Their lips part, he pulls back to look at her ...
          But it's the BRUNETTE WOMAN who stares back at him!!

          Jack wakes, breathless, troubled. He doesn't know this
          woman who invades his dreams...
          Next to him, Victoria lies asleep, curled in the sheets.
          Shaken, he quietly gets up, grabs clothes... and goes
          where he goes when Victoria is asleep...

          Jack moves to a BENCH where he keeps his finds... a few
          coins, a watch, a pistol, a snow globe showing the

          JACK produces his newest find from the library: THE

          Might just be interference, but
          there shouldn't be anything there.

                         JACK
          Drone?
          Already she's got the signal analyzed on six different
          screens. No matches...

          No... It's.. I'm not sure what
          it is.
          INTERCUT Jack listening to her in the Bubbleship.

                         JACK
          Don't be embarrassed, there's
          always a first time.

                         (BEAT)
          Send it over. I'll check it out.
          Victoria hesitates... hits a key.

                         VICTORIA
          On its way. Be careful, okay?

          EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

          Jack's ship skims over the surface of a deep pool of
          water. Up ahead, a waterfall explodes its force into the
          pool, spray and mist already reaching the Bubbleship.

                         JACK
          All right, I'm coming up to the
          location.
          Jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall
          of falling water which almost seems to conceal a Petra
          behind its veil. Jack reaches the top...
          JACK'S POV - THE SPIRE AND OBSERVATIONAL DECK of the
          EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, now part of a cliff, set in
          shifted sea-bed, a gushing river pouring past.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack lands and gets out of the craft, grabbing his weapon
          and Yankees cap as he does. He looks around, half
          nervous, half in awe that the old girl is still standing.

                         JACK
          (under his breath)
          New York, New York... It's a
          wonderful town. The Bronx is up,
          and the Battery's down...
          He can hear nothing over the wind and the water. He
          moves to the balcony edge, looks "downtown" at the sunken
          city. A Venice set in a matrice of rubble and sea-bed.

                         CONTINUED:
          He notices an old PAY TELESCOPE next to him, bent and
          rusted. He puts his eyes to the lenses. Nothing.
          Black.
          He STARES at the 25-cent slot on top, lost in a deep
          sense of Deja-Vu...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, you're right on top of it.
          What do you see?
          Jack starts a circuit of the deck. A pile of old deck
          chairs in his way, he pushes at them with his foot...
          finds a WIRE, running below them, linked to two CAR
          BATTERIES, hidden under the rubbish.
          He traces the path of the wire... up.

          EXT. TOP OF THE ESB ANTENAE - LATER

          JACK has made an arduous climb to discover a TRANSMITTER,
          hooked to an old MILITARY REPEATER, and both hooked to...
          we look up as Jack does... the RUSTED, DAMAGED, ESB
          Antenna atop the building.

                         JACK
          Bob, give me audible on this
          signal.
          Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the
          intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          At the bubbleship, Jack watches the frequency analysis of
          the signal play on his heads-up. He touches the screen
          and the signal goes quiet.

                         VICTORIA
          What did you find?

                         JACK
          It's an old radio system. It's
          been reactivated.

                         VICTORIA
          Define reactivated.
          Jack looks at the batteries, the wire...

          Jack, that signal's going out over
          the whole territory. You need to
          blow the structure.

                         JACK
          It's the Empire State --

                         VICTORIA
          It's ancient history, Jack. You
          know the procedure. Blow it.
          He pulls several CHARGES from the Bubbleship's storage,
          starts to set them...
          He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope.
          Change of plans. He walks towards the batteries, a blade
          sliding out of the cuff of his suit. He reaches them and
          SEVERS the lines. The signal dies.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bubbleship lifts off. Jack can't help staring down
          at the Observation Deck as the ship lifts into the air.

          TNT. BUBBLESHIP - DAY
          Jack is in the air, troubled. Up ahead in the distance
          we see a LARGE NATURAL RIDGE. Some instruments light up.

                         VICTORIA
          Check your course, you're headed
          right at the border.

                         JACK
          Yeah, I may have seen another
          drone trap...

                         INTERCUT VICTORIA
          She checks her map. Jack's Bubbleship is headed straight
          at a large red swath of territory marked out, toxic
          radiation levels constantly monitored.
          A small ALARM goes off in the Bubbleship cabin.

                         VICTORIA
          You're at the edge of range, Jack.
          You're starting to break up.

                         (SERIOUS)
          No, it's not okay. You get in too
          close that radiation --

                         JACK
          -- will cook me from the inside
          before I know it. Don't worry,
          I'm still more than five clicks
          from the beacons...
          IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull-
          and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the
          ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings.
          Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS.
          Victoria's voice barely coming through.

                         VICTORIA
          What are -- you ---- out there
          Jack?
          The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a
          steep canyon, rock on all sides. Barely room to squeeze,
          but Jack's not worried. This is all familiar.

                         JACK
          That's right, Bob. You know where
          we're going.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria stares at the screen, static hiss low and empty.
          It's not the first time he's done this, but she hates it
          every time.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack...?
          Victoria works the panel, upping signal, boosting
          reception. The static is again MIXED WITH GARBLED
          SOUNDS. She listens, confused, ups the volume...
          BLIP! That signal from the Empire State starts again.
          This time it LOCKS ON, a loud and continuous electronic
          pattern.

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          JACK's ship emerges from a canyon into a beautiful
          landscape we have never seen before. This is Jack's
          SECRET PLACE. TREES exist on an island surrounded by
          clean water.
          And near the shore, a GROTTO, a carved-out portion of the
          hillside, supported with scavenged timbers, protected by
          plastic tarps. A ton of gear is piled inside. JACK has
          been scavenging for a long time.
          The BUBBLESHIP lands. JACK walks into the structure,
          slapping on a relay from a SOLAR GENERATOR. All around
          are young growing plants, including small yellow flowers
          and their GREEN SEEDLINGS -- the same Jack gave to Vika.
          Jack kneels down by an old military JAMMER. He checks a
          screen: the Crater Lake location is being jammed.

          INT_SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - DAY
          Victoria sits, the repetitive audio of the signal playing
          from her console. She stares at the empty map, the
          notable absence of the Bubbleship's icon on it. She keys
          the Comm, one last time.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack? Jack, I really need you
          online...

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          A RECORD PLAYER is taped into his solar power system. An
          EARLY METAL POWER-BALLAD floats out of the speakers.
          Jack has a basketball hoop lashed to a pole. He shoots
          hoops by himself, the ROVER retrieves the ball.
          LATER. Jack brings a single CHAIR out in front of the
          water. He sits, and with care produces the books he's
          brought with him. He opens one with burnt edges:

          TREASURE ISLAND.
          .I remember him as if it were yesterday,
          as he came plodding to the inn door, his
          sea-chest following behind him in a hand-
          barrow...
          JACK is in an obscure state of frustration. He lifts
          another book, THE LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME:

          Victoria clocks off. Stares at the border area on the
          map where she last saw Jack.
          A KLAXON goes off in her workspace. Victoria STARTS. For
          the first time she seems confused as she works the
          console. She can't immediately figure it out...
          Suddenly she brings up a WIDE SCAN for tracking the Tet,
          The whole Eastern Coast of the continent. And something
          is closing, coming over the poles, FAST.

          ON VICTORIA...

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          Jack folds the page of his book, stuffs it in his cargo
          pocket and walks down to the water sparkling over stones.
          Motion catches his attention. It's the ROVER,
          approaching with the basketball.

                         JACK
          So, um... Victoria.
          The ROVER shifts, confused.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I was thinking, when our tour is
          up, maybe we'd stay. We could put
          in for another -- Wait, wait.
          Stop yelling. Hear me out. No,
          don't throw that, that's a...
          The ROVER turns around. Jack smiles at the poor
          machine's confusion. The smile dying... this is serious.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          BOOM!
          What appears to be A METEOR streaks across the sky,
          leaving a trail of flame and white smoke.
          Jack grabs his binocs and traces the meteor path...
          resolves it just barely as the shuttle, crashing down.
          It disappears over a rise, a beat, then a FIERY

          EXPLOSION.

          Western Valley.

                         JACK
          I saw it through optics in the
          last minute. I'm not sure it was
          alien.

                         VICTORIA
          Turn around, Jack. The Drones
          will handle the situation.

                         JACK
          The Drones'll kill anything that
          moves.

                         VICTORIA
          Just for once wait for your
          orders on this one, Jack. This is
          serious.
          Jack is silent, unsure. The crash site growing closer...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Technician. This is your Control.
          Turn around.

                         JACK
          Vika...

                         VICTORIA
          You heard me.
          Another hard beat. Jack hating this but...

                         JACK
          Negative. I'll report when I get
          to the site.

          IN THE BUBBLESHTP. Bob seems to shake his head.

          (sotto, to Bob:)
          What are you looking at?

           INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Victoria STARES at her Comm. This has never happened.

          EXT. CRASH SITE -- DAY

          A MOUNTAINOUS AREA of what was once sea-bed. Smoky
          orange fire blows across the ruined landscape. A fire in
          a dust storm. A GUST now reveals...
          The crashed NASA space shuttle, with the name ODYSSEY on
          its fractured hull.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          JACK is circling the wreckage, looking down.

                         JACK
          I'm here, and it's definitely one
          of ours.

                         VICTORIA
          I'm not confirming this from the
          Tet.

                         JACK
          I'm confirming it. I'm right
          here.
          Vika works her displays, scanning, wanting to keep him
          safe. The wreckage has strewn out thousands of flaming
          pieces of debris, all which register heat signatures.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          This thing is ancient, one of the
          old pre-war shuttles.
          JACK'S POV - THE WRECKAGE. The ship's guts are strewn
          across the earth. Several pod-like canisters strewn
          around, more fixed into the burning wreckage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          EXT. CRASH SITE -- CONTINUOUS

          JACK TOUCHES DOWN, rolling out of his Bubbleship even
          before it's settled. He heads straight into the burning
          wreckage, into hell. Heat SEARING his eyes, disorienting
          him. All around metal POPS and GROANS as it distends.
           He moves through metal panels, dodging flames and burning
          debris -- searching wildly.
          Jack sees what looks like a SURVIVOR! HAULS it over to
          discover it's only an empty NASA jumpsuit. But beyond
          that... A DELTA-SLEEP POD, split wide open. Its
          interior EMPTY. Jack moves on, finds another POD,
          presses his face against the glass...
          A HUMAN FACE on the other side. A MAN, sleeping...
          A FUEL EXPLOSION plumes into the dark sky. Jack STUMBLES
          ON, tracks another pod literally ON FIRE. Beyond that, a
          whole portion of the ship is semi-intact, the hull ripped
          lengthwise. Jack tracks a burnished STEEL CYLINDER with
          radioactive markings, locked in strong moorings...
          And near that, another POD, still locked in the ship's
          wall. Jack moves to it, wiping away soot and grime,
          pressing his face close and sees her...

          .THE BRUNETTE WOMAN FROM HIS DREAMS.
          She's asleep, her face lit by moving firelight. JACK is
          stunned. Eyes dart to readouts: She's alive.
          ON JACK. Confused, amazed, moved. He puts a hand out,
          towards the glass of the pod...

                         JACK

                         OKAY
          SVUNK! SVUNK! Behind Jack, plasma rounds impact the Pod
          with the man in it, the metal going nova, collapsing...

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          NO! 1!
          Cannon fire erupts all around him! TWO DRONES settle on
          the site, their weapons kicking out energy, locking on
          and destroying Pods...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          NO! NO! They're firing on the
          ship. Vika, it's one of ours.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria stares at her screens, perhaps for the first
          time in her life, frozen. Jack's voice blares over
          speakers.

                         JACK
          There are people here, and they're
          killing them!
          Victoria opens her mouth to respond. She can't.

          EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

          A Drone passes right over Jack, locks into position,
          lining its cannons on the Pod with the WOMAN in it...
          Jack moves between the Drone and the Pod. The Drone
          hesitates...
          SCANS him. Weapons literally red hot from
          repeated fire.
          The Drone SHIFTS AGAIN, FAST, looking for its shot. Jack
          counters, keeping his body between the Drone and the Pod.

                         JACK
          Get out of here! Go away! Get!
          A moment of insane bravado, Jack un-shoulders his weapon,
          strafes the Drone with gunfire which knocks it back.
          It re-centers, weapons chugging with energy.
          INTERCUT VICTORIA. Staring at the feeds. A screen
          catching a half-image of Jack firing at the Drone. She's
          absolutely still, holding her breath...
          Jack stares at the Drone, at certain death.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Well, what the hell are you
          waiting for? GO ON!
          And suddenly, the Drone moves on, Canons live, searching
          on into the wreckage, annihilating other Pods.
          ON JACK, chest heaving...
          An instant of BLACK, shuttering back to:
          CROSS-HAIR POV: We suddenly see Jack through CROSS-
          HAIRS, tracking him as he shields the Delta Pod with his
          body, dragging it towards the Bubbleship...

                         CONTINUED:
          A high-tech, high-powered RIFLE rests in two alien-
          armored hands. Like a metal-coated insect tarsus (barbed
          feet of a fly). The alien begins to depress the
          trigger... Then another tarsus presses the barrel down.
          Don't. Don't fire.
          SHIFTING OVER: Close on an ALIEN. Our first real look,
          still too close to truly comprehend. Thick stubbled hair
          armored with metal, bones; A head-dress of authority.
          Behind layers of dusted cracked goggles, the older alien
          eye... blinks.

          EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

          JACK reaches the Bubbleship, heaves the Delta Pod onto
          the carrier which immediately secures it with armatures
          designed to carry damaged drones.
          JACK steals another look at the sleeping face of the
          WOMAN. He touches the glass, wiping away soot and dust.

                         JACK
          It's you...

          SEEN FROM FAR AWAY
          The Bubbleship flies up and up, The DELTA SLEEP POD
          securely hanging from its belly, carrying Jack and this
          mysterious woman away into the evening sky.

          EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - SUNSET

          The WIND is wild and brutal. As the Bubbleship touches
          down, CLAMPS snap on the landing skids.
          Jack is in motion, bursting out of the ship. He glances
          up. Victoria stands behind the glass of the Sky Tower
          living room, staring at him.
          THUNK. He releases the armature. HAULS the Pod with him
          towards the house. HAMMERS ON THE GLASS.

                         JACK
          Open it!
          Victoria obeys, opens the glass doors. WIND fills the
          living room as Jack hauls the Pod in. Then Victoria
          touches a control and the walls SEAL.

          The drones tried to kill her.
          They destroyed the other
          survivors.

                         VICTORIA

                         (RATIONALIZING)
          Well it didn't recognize her.
          It's machinery. It's programmed

                         MACHINERY --

                         JACK
          She came off a NASA shuttle. The
          drones were specifically targeting
          the pods --

                         VICTORIA
          I don't know what the machinery
          did or didn't do. There's
          protocol...

                         JACK
          Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the
          machinery now, Victoria?
          VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question
          into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod.

                         VICTORIA
          Go get the cutter, and a breather,
          and my big bag. Now. The Pod's
          been damaged, she's not doing
          well, let's get her out of there.
          Jack moves. Victoria, almost holds back, but...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          .This has to be reported.
          HE SPINS. Stares at her. Really angry.

                         JACK
          I know it does. And when we
          report it, we'll also report that
          drones slaughtered the other human
          survivors from one of our ships.
          See what they make of that.
          He goes for the equipment. Victoria stares at the
          woman's face, deeply unsettled...
          Jack returns with Victoria's bag, and firing up a CUTTER.

                         VICTORIA
          Right there, be careful...
          Jack directs the blue arc towards a seal. The Pod
          depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air. Jack
          pulls back the pod door.
          Inside, the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit. Her hair
          is matted. Her body looks frail, her skin translucent,
          veins dark, lips blue, like a drowning victim.
          Vika pulls her feeding tube, takes her pulse, checks her
          eyes, lifting the lids.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Lift her up, we have to get some
          air into her.
          JACK gets his arms around the woman, pulling her upwards.
          FLUID seeps from her mouth...
          And suddenly she's ALIVE, COUGHING, spewing fluid across
          Jack and the floor. He sets her down as she painfully
          wretches, then SUCKS IN AIR. Her eyes flutter open.
          She's suddenly violently ill again. Instinctively, Jack
          goes to hold her --

                          VICTORIA (CONT'D)

                         (PROFESSIONAL)
          No. Don't. Let her get the fluid
          out.
          The woman stops heaving. Looks up at both of them...
          She tries to stand, disoriented by the glass walls, the
          infinite vertigo that surrounds them. She falls to her
          knees and stares with amazement down into the clouds.
          Jack kneels beside her, puts a hand on her shoulder.

                         JACK
          You're safe. You're in a
          skytower, on Earth.

                         WOMAN
          .Jack.
          Victoria gives a sharp look at Jack. He's stunned.
          Now completely exhausted, the woman SLUMPS into
          unconsciousness. Jack catches her. Victoria comes
          close, slides an oxygen breather mask over her face.

          INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          A bizarre and almost beautiful tableau: ALL THREE
          together under the water, Jack holding the unconscious
          Woman like a child. The warm water spraying over their
          three forms, soaking the woman's gauzy suit which clings
          to her body. Water running across Jack and Victoria's
          faces, their open eyes, locked on each other.
          The water finally stops.

                         VICTORIA
          We have to get her up to the Tet.

                         JACK
          I know.

                         VICTORIA
          I don't have the facilities here.
          Once she's stable...

                         JACK
          I know.
          The glass door slides open behind them. Neither move.

                         VICTORIA
          What's going on?
          He shakes his head. He has no idea.

          INT. INFIRMARY BAY - LATER

          The WOMAN lies in a bed. VICTORIA checks her readouts,
          adjusts her UV drip. She glances over her and realizes
          that the woman's eyes are open, staring at her.
          Beat. Victoria turns, offers the woman some water.

                         VICTORIA
          Here. Drink this. You're
          dehydrated... You've been in a
          very bad crash. Your ship came
          down.
          This DISTURBS the woman. She tries to sit up.

                         WOMAN
          .Julia. Julia.
          The woman, JULIA, sinks back down, exhausted.

                         VICTORIA
          You need to rest quietly. You've
          been in delta sleep for a long
          time.

                         JULIA
          How long...?

                         VICTORIA
          Best guess? About 65 years.
          Julia takes that in...

                         JULIA
          Where's Jack...?
          Julia STARTS. Looks down at her arm where Victoria has
          just slid a needle under her skin. She stares at her,
          almost afraid. Victoria depresses the plunger.

          EXT. SKY TOWER - NIGHT

          SEEN FROM AFAR. The Sky Tower a lonely refuge in a
          roiling storm, turning on its axis, like a weather-vane
          And we PLUNGE DOWN. Down and down, to the base of the
          SKYTOWER, to see...

          EXT. SKY TOWER BASE - NIGHT

          AN ALIEN, battered by wind, rags blowing, raises its mask
          to the sky. Looking up towards the tower. It wears the
          DISTINCTIVE HEAD-DRESS that we have seen before.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46 ,

          INT. SKY TOWER, DINING AREA - NIGHT

          Victoria is very subdued, poking at food. Both very
          aware of the woman sleeping in the infirmary.

                         VICTORIA
          Tomorrow, I'll report that we have
          her.
          Jack nods, but won't look at her. Deep in thought.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Jack...

                         (BEAT)
          What do you want from me, Jack?
          This isn't just a Shakespeare
          Sonnet, a buffalo nickel, some
          vase...

                         JACK
          It's a Greek funeral vase. Which
          I want my ashes in, incidentally.
          Victoria collects the dishes, heads for the kitchen.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I just think we need to know why.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, please. This isn't why
          we're here. This is just what we
          have to do before our real lives
          begin. We've given them five
          years and now we get to go home.

                         (BEAT)
          So just leave this alone. It's
          not our job.

                         JACK
          And what if I can't?
          They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened.

          EXT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT

          Julia sleeps, a mask taped to her face, oxygen hissing.
          Jack watches her. Now cleaned and dry, there's a
          natural, earthy, freckled beauty to her. Air passing
          peacefully through her lips, now returned to color.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CONTINUED:
          Jack reaches out to brushes hair from her face. He
          notices the outline of a necklace with a pendant under
          her nightgown.

          INT. SKY TOWER, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Victoria sets dishes in a dishwasher. She stops. She
           can see Jack in the Infirmary, staring at Julia.

           INT. WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT

          DRONE 166 sits in its hub, repaired. Jack replaces a
           panel, moves to a laptop and activates the drone.
          It POWERS UP, rising fast, bringing its canons around.
          We should be afraid, very afraid, that something is wrong
          with it. It SCANS Jack, as menacing as ever. But
          something's changed in Jack. He just stares back at it.
          Beat. Then the DRONE FIRES itself off into the black
          clouds, disappearing towards the earth below.
          Jack stares after it; then he turns, looks across empty
          space to the underside of the glass pool. Victoria has
          just dived in. She swims laps, kicking hard,
          bubblestreams peeling across her body. Exercise, not
          pleasure.

          EXT. SKY TOWER, POOLSIDE - NIGHT

          Jack stands at the end of the pool, watches Victoria
          stoke powerfully towards him. She sees him as she
          reaches the edge, stops, looking up at him.
          This is important, something Jack's been wanting to say
          for a long time:

                         JACK
          I read these books, of what it was
          like down here, before...
          He sits, his legs dangling into the water. She pulls up
          close, her arms on the side.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          In this one book I was reading, a
          man describes being a child. He
          remembers a yellow kitchen, a
          baked apple.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CONTINUED:

                         VICTORIA
          I know. That was the world
          before. Your little obsession...

                         JACK
          What was so wonderful about life
          on the Tet?
          She looks away...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          When our time is up next month. I
          want to put in for one more tour.
          Victoria pushes off from the side, drifts back...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          It's almost all gone, Victoria. I
          want to be here for the end.
          She turns, resumes swimming laps. Hard, driving through
          the water. He watches her for a moment, then turns away.

          INT. SKY TOWER - NIGHT

          Victoria comes in from the pool. She can see Jack in the
          bedroom, sitting on the bed, his back to her.
          She moves into the Infirmary, moves to Julia and checks
          her IV drip. She starts to adjust it, stops.
          She stares down at Julia.

          INT. SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Victoria comes in from the infirmary. She opens a
          closet, changes into a night shirt.

                         JACK

                         VIKA --
          She turns and grabs him, desperate.

                         VICTORIA
          Please. Please. Don't you
          understand? We have a chance to
          be on the first boats out, to be
          the first to settle Mars, raise a
          family. Five years. Proof that
          we are an effective team.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         CONTINUED:
          She holds his face, kisses him, willing him to want her
          as desperately.

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          Everything we've wanted is waiting
          for us up there. Please, Jack.

                         JACK
          I don't know if it is or not,
          Victoria. I can't remember.
          She starts to reply... has nothing. Shakes her head.
          She grabs blankets and pulls them around herself, her
          back to him, her eyes open, scared. Jack also lies down,
          staring upwards. And then Jack asks the 64,000 dollar

                         QUESTION:

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Do you remember her?
          Victoria doesn't move. Stares straight out.

          EXT. THE SKYTOWER - NIGHT

          WIND shakes the SKYTOWER, and the clouds boil beneath it.
          Jack and Victoria sleep next to each other.
          In the infirmary, Julia sleeps alone. A machine "beeps."

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY (DREAM)

          We're in the deep saturation of Jack's dream. Images fly
          by, then SLOW. People, enjoying the view. New York
          City. Jack, looking through the pay telescope. Then
          turning, seeing...
          Julia right next to him, smiling up, happy.

          INT. THE SKY TOWER, BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Jack's eyes open. That dream again. Victoria's still
          asleep next to him. He rises out of bed...

          INT. SKY TOWER - VERY EARLY MORNING

          Jack pads out into the main room. STOPS when he sees
          Julia, risen from the infirmary, standing at one of the
          glass walls of the Sky Tower, staring out.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         CONTINUED:
          It's early early morning. Probably 3:00 am. While it's
           dark below, the first signs of dark blue and orange
          sunrise are visible on the horizon. THE PLANETARY RING
          glows with soft golden light.
          JULIA'S POV: In the distance, the Tet is rising, faint
          light on its surface as it crests the planet's curve.
          VERY CLOSE on Julia. The image of Tet reflected in the
          corneas of her eyes. She's been crying, silently, and
          alone. One hand at her chest.

                         JACK
          It's beautiful, isn't it? It's
          your home now.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          How do you feel?
          She wipes her eyes.

                         JULIA
          A bit more... located.

                         JACK
          What was your shuttle's mission?
          She turns to him, watches him carefully in the dim light.
          And then, lying:

                         JULIA
          I don't remember. I should get
          back to the ship. I might be able
          to find the flight recorder.

                         JACK
          Your ship... it's pre-war.

                         JULIA
          (again, careful)
          Have you ever seen a ship like
          that?

                         JACK
          No. No, of course not.
          This answers something important for Julia.

                         JULIA
          I wonder what brought us back?

                         JACK
          .There was a transmission. I
          don't know who sent it.

          51.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         JULIA
          We'll never really know without
          the flight recorder.
          (almost casually...)
          She says we can't go down there,
          that it's too dangerous.
          He laughs a little, shakes his head.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          What?

                         JACK
          Funnily enough, you've found your
          man.

                         JULIA

                         (SMILING)
          Have I?
          An awkward beat, then:

                         JACK
          How did you know my name?

                         JULIA
          .You look like someone I once
          knew.
          (extending her hand)
          I understand I owe you my life.
          Thank you, Jack.
          They shake. A weird moment. She breaks away, looks back
          at the Tet which now glows a pale orange on the horizon.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          What happens now?

                         JACK
          In a few hours, the Tet will come
          online. Victoria will report your
          rescue and I imagine they'll send
          someone down for you.

                         JULIA
          From... the `Pet?

                         JACK
          Yes.
          She gestures out to the Bubbleship on its pad.

          You fly that thing?

                         JACK
          .You could say that.
          She SMILES, pleased. A twinkle in her eye...

                         JULIA
          Alright then. Don't you want to
          know?

          EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - EARLY MORNING

          JACK and JULIA are suited up, ready to go. The Tetis
          still low and far on the dark horizon, silhouetted bythe
          first signs of sunlight growing in the East...
          The Bubbleship's ENGINES start up with their distinctive
          whine. As they head towards the ship, Victoria comes out
          from the house, a robe pulled on...

                         VICTORIA
          Jack! What are you doing?

                         JACK
          I'll bring her back before Tet-
          Rise. We just want to try to find
          the flight recorder. You can't
          know everything watching from a
          mile up.

                         VICTORIA
          She shouldn't be --
          Julia turns on Victoria, quickly.

                         JULIA
          Thank you. I feel very well.
          Then, coldly, she boards the ship.

                         JACK
          She's the flight officer, she
          wants. to see the wreck of her ship
          and secure items there. You'd
          want to do the same thing.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack, please.

          53.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JACK
          Don't worry, we'll be back before
          you have to make your report.

                         VICTORIA
          That's not it. I can't protect
          you with the Tet offline and I
          just have a very bad...

                         JACK
          I'll be fine.
          He turns and boards. Julia is staring at her through the
          bubble-canopy.
          The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side,
          plummeting towards earth.

          INT. BUBBLE SHIP - EARLY DAWN

          Jack pulls the ship out of its dive, sets course across
          the altered earth. Julia is STARING down, a little
          afraid, but darkly fascinated...
          Victoria's voice cuts through on the Comm.

                         VICTORIA
          Jack... This isn't just about
          protocol. I'm trying to
          understand.

                         JACK

                         (BEAT)
          I'll be home for breakfast.
          And he SWITCHES OFF the Comm.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria STARES at the dead Comm. A moment, then she
          SLAMS the panel with her fists. She backs off, staring
          at the panel.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          They fly in silence. Julia gazes down at sights we're by
          now familiar with, becoming visible as the first light
          hits. The craters, emaciated seascape.

          54.

                         JULIA
          So I guess I'm around... a hundred
          years old.

                         (BEAT)
          What happened next?
          He gestures towards the moon ring in the sky.

                         JACK
          The Scavs assumed taking out the
          moon would wipe us out, and it
          almost did. But we re-grouped,
          fought back. We beat them in the
          end.
          She glances at him.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          That's if you call nuking half the
          planet beating anybody.
          He looks at her, shrugs. They fly past a RESOURCE
          GATHER, its column of water lifting from the seas.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          We harvest seawater to supply the
          Mars colony with the energy we
          need to live there. We're almost
          done. Pretty soon, there'll be no
          more water down here.

                         JULIA
          A dry planet...
          He nods at the Tet, rising in the distance.

                         JACK
          Yeah. What's left of us are up
          there now, ready to go where you
          were headed, Mars. 40 acres and a
          mule. What we've got left. What
          you've got.
          Julia stares out at the Tet.

                         JULIA
          What about you?

                         JACK
          We were born and raised up there.
          Vika's the A-student. I'm just a
          tech... I fix things. I...

          55.

                         CONTINUED; ( 2)
          JULIA looks at him. Something out of the groove.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Why are you looking at me like
          that?

                         JULIA
          Sorry.
          She stares back down at the landscape.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          It's so beautiful.
          He looks at her, surprised. He thought he was the only
          one...

          EXT. CRASH SITE - EARLY MORNING

          THE BUBBLESHIP sits landed amidst the wreckage. A low
          still fog has condensed, leaving visibility low, moisture
          everywhere. While there was light up high, they've
          descended back into the pre-dawn darkness.
          The ROVER has detached, shining its small light in their
          direction to help.
          Julia searches fruitlessly. Everything from the wreck
          small enough to carry away has been taken by Scavs. Every
          piece of fabric and metal.
          Jack half watches her, half tracks the periphery, his
          weapon slung low.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria sits at her workstation, upset.
          She's got the Bubbleship up on the map, its cam feed on
          display.

          EXT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS

          Julia, still weakened from Delta Sleep, hauls aside
          debris, revealing a metal floor-plate, unscrewed and
          discarded. The slot within is empty.

                         JULIA
          No! NO! It's been taken. DAMN

          IT!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CONTINUED:
          She backs off, upset, breathing hard.

                         JACK
          Look, it doesn't matter --

                         JULIA
          It matters, okay!? You don't...
          you can't understand... I need
          that flight recorder. I need to
          know what happened.

                         (BEAT)
          You need to know what happened.

                         JACK
          We should stay close to...
          She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she
          locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder
          Jack saw. It's also gone.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          What was it?
          She STARES at him, wanting to say something. Deciding
          not to. She leans back against a wall of the shuttle.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria has tried to ignore the cam feeds, working on
          other things. She glances over, then away just as a FORM
          passes by one of the cam feeds!
          Victoria checks another readout, glances back as TWO MORE
          FORMS pass by the camera. Glimpses of metal and fur...

                         VICTORIA
          (hitting the Comm)
          Jack! Jack! There's something
          coming your way. JACK!!"

          TNT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS
          Jack's Bubbleship sits silent. The COMM still switched
          off. Suddenly ANOTHER FORM moves through our line of
          sight, something's there, and CLOSE.
          WITH JACK and JULIA.
          The air still, damp. Almost no sound. She picks through
          the remains of the ship. He's staring at her.

                         JULIA
          (without looking up)
          You're staring at me.

                         JACK
          I'm sorry.
          INTERCUT: Victoria watches as MORE AND MORE Alien
          figures pass the camera feed. Moving towards Jack and
          Julia's position. Victoria, HELPLESS.
          Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time.
          He stares at her...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          How do I know you...
          ON JULIA'S FACE. Suddenly her vision racks...
          JACK SPINS, sees emerging out of the mist, SCAVS. A
          dozen of them. Alien tribesmen, bristling with weapons,
          war-like high-tech headdresses. Mandibles and claws.
          Terrifying and close.
          Jack reaches for his weapon, bringing it around and --
          SLAM! He's hit from the side by a SCAV. Its armored
          body bringing him to the ground. He tries to CRAWL AWAY,
          sees Julia grabbed. He twists, sees Scavs crawling over
          the Bubbleship.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Bob! HOME!
          In the background, the Bubbleship BLASTS OFF, Scavs
          falling off as Jack KICKS BACKWARDS, breaking the Scavs
          hold. He rolls away towards his weapon-
          - straight into the legs of a GIANT SCAV holding an
          improvised club which now comes down, IMPACTING JACK...

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          VICTORIA stares at image of the wreck growing SMALLER as
          the Bubbleship rises.

                         VICTORIA

          JACK! JACK...!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          EXT. OPEN LAND - DAWN

          Darkness. LOUD SOUNDS. ANIMAL PANTING. Small, glimpses
          of earth moving by, then darkness again.
          Jack and Julia are tied to a huge SCAV SLED pulled by
          twelve FERAL DOGS. A combination of old scavenged
          military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world
          without engine-power. Giant treads roll forward as the
          dogs STRAIN against metallic harnesses.
          Jack's head lolls to the side. He blinks, looks over to
          see Julia next to him, unconscious. He tracks up. At
          the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the
          sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize:
          The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the
          dogs who haul the sled forward.
          We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark
          as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal...
          The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine
          meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path
          left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain.

          INT. SKY TOWER - MORNING

          Victoria hears the SOUND OF THE BUBBLESHIP, arriving.
          She rushes to the glass of the Sky Tower, sees the
          Bubbleship, docking itself. Auto pilot. No one inside.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN CANYONS - MORNING

          From far away, we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon
          which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and
          steel. Something giant and industrial in its time.
          The sled approaches, seems to disappear as it moves under
          a shadowy outcropping of rock. In the dark underneath,
          huge metal doors... close.

          INT. A DARK SPACE -- NO TIME

          Almost complete blackness, just the SOUND of a slow drip
          of water. In the far distance, the howls and chatter of
          Scavs.
          Jack's blood-encrusted eyes blink open. Irises dilate
          trying to orient. He raises his head, can barely see.

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          He and Julia lie in the only pool of light in the room,
          filtering in from a high ventilation shaft. She's
          unconscious. Around him, in the dark, the sense of
          movement.
          His eyes adjusting, he squints into the dark. There's a
          FORM on the edges of the light, watching him. Jack
          tenses as the figure...
          .strikes a match on the floor, brings the flame to its
          face, revealing... An Old Man: BEECH. He sucks in on
          the end of a cigar. For a moment, their eyes meet.
          Then the match goes out. Dark silhouette again. Only
          the feint orange glow from the cigar.

                         BEECH
          MonteCristo, #2. Do you have any
          idea how long I've waited, for
          this?
          He EXHALES a stream of smoke into the beam, then moves
          closer, into the light. Beech's face is lined with age
          and exposure, his skin scarred from battle. His teeth
          yellowed and crooked, but his arms and body are strong.
          Jack TENSES. Beech's voice is calm, with a barely held-
          back malice lurking just under the surface.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Well, let me tell you, Jack. It's
          been a long time...

                         JACK
          Who are you? Where is this?
          BEECH inhales again. There's a piercing curiosity to
          Beech's gaze, studying him.

                         BEECH
          We're deep underground. Very deep
          underground.

                         JACK
          We were taken by the Scavs...

                         BEECH
          Oh... The "Scavs".

                         (BEAT)
          Tell me, Jack. Have you ever met
          a Scav, up close?

          Jack is suddenly aware of other FORMS in this room.
          Motion, on the periphery. Hair... Feathers. Scavs?

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          No, of course not. You just
          repair the damage, keep the Drones
          up and killing. Don't ask many
          questions, do you, Jack? No part
          of the...

          Beech pulls off the cigar...

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Brutal, if you think about it.
          The way your Drones -

                         JACK
          The Scavs took everything from us.
          And if you're working with them --

                         BEECH
          Interesting, Jack. Interesting.
          You're worried I might be some
          kind of... Collaborator.
          Jack doesn't respond.

                         (ASIDE)
          Lllllllights!
          A beat, then a BANK of lights flickers on, revealing
          HUMANS, all around them, heavily armed.
          Julia GROANS, the light bringing her to. Jack moves to
          protect her, tracks ten, TWENTY people... He looks UP
          where ROWS AND ROWS of men and women stare down from
          above with undisguised animosity. Forty, fifty more...
          At the front, a strong battle-scared Scav, SYKES, hovers
          on the edge of violence. He's been recently WOUNDED.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          You see...? We're not Aliens,
          Jack. We're very much human.
          Jack can't process. Human face after human face.

                          BEECH (CONT'D)
          Of course that's a problem. Your
          drones go for human shapes, human
          voices. So... we change our
          shapes, change our voices.

                         (INHALING SMOKE)
          The Drones still kill us, but
          they're not nearly so aggressive
          as when they smell a human target.
          Did you ever ask yourself why that
          is?

                         JACK
          No, they're programmed to

                         BEECH
          To what, Jack?

                         (OFF JULIA)
          You saw it yourself. You almost
          got yourself blown to bits
          protecting her. I've been meaning
          to ask you, why did you do that?

                         JACK
          Anyone would have...

                         BEECH
          Anyone. Would have. Interesting.
          Julia comes around, her eyes flickering open, She
          SCREAMS, looking frantically for an escape. Jack GRABS
          her, protecting her, calming her.
          Beech gets CLOSE, studies Jack, what he's doing. Nods.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Very interesting.
          Beech moves away. Jack moves after him and suddenly
          forty or more weapons lock onto him. Sykes closer than
          any other.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Careful, Jack. I'm afraid you're
          not very popular here.
          Beech switches his gaze to Julia.

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          Welcome back to earth, commander.

          INT. GROW-HALL, RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          They pass into a giant area devoted to agriculture. ROWS
          of wide, two-story glass tubes hold PLANTS bearing fruit.
          Their roots are held bare, bathed only in moist air...

                         BEECH
          We grow what we can, under the
          lights. It isn't much; Wheat-
          grass, some vegetables, what beans
          and soy we can. The general state
          of our health proves that human
          beings are not herbivores, but the
          alternative is not appetizing to

          Beech moves on, turning down another corridor.
          There are PAINTINGS, stacked against the walls. Picasso,
          Monet, Kandinsky, Warhol. SCULPTURES in piles.

          A Grand Piano is pushed in a corner, other instruments
          propped against it. They pass a room filled with BOOKS,
          another with a SCREEN mounted in front of a projector.
          For a moment, Jack forgets everything else. It's like
          his private collection at Crater Lake, but a hundred
          times bigger, richer...
          Julia stops in front of a painting of a young girl in a
          field of golden grass, staring towards a farmhouse on the
          horizon. She turns to Jack.

          It reminds me of home...

          Jack and Julia are held back by Scavs as up ahead Beech's
          second-in-command, the battle-hardened SYKES, whispers
          heatedly in his ear, glancing back. Not everyone thinks
          having Jack and Julia here is a good idea.
          Jack peers over the edge of the gantry they are on. FAR
          BELOW, ancient GEOTHERMAL TURBINES churn.

                         JULIA
          Jack, what he said about the
          Tet...

                         JACK
          (not looking at her)
          It took three decades to build the
          Tet. And when it was finally
          ready and it was time to go up,
          there were people who refused.
          Leaders, who told their people to
          stay.
          Staring at Beech, the glint in the man's eyes...

          slaughtered.
          Whatever the conversation is, it doesn't go well. Sykes
          storms off, angry. Other Scavs go with him.

          EXT. CANYON - DAY

          The ROVER has reached the Canyon, starts to make its way
          in towards Raven Rock.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - DAY

          Vika is on a tear, working hard. Unable to reach Jack,
          she's looking for any clue, anything to help find him.
          To that end she's replaying the recordings of her last
          transmission from the Bubbleship. We hear her last

                         PLEADING:

                         VICTORIA'S VOICE
          Jack! Jack! There's something
          coming your way. JACK!!!!
          Victoria LISTENS, chilled. She hits REWIND, then PLAY:

          .It'll be fine. Trust me.

                         JACK'S VOICE
          I'll be home for breakfast.
          Alone in the Sky Tower, this hits Victoria hard.
          REWIND. Victoria STARES at the counter, letting it go
          further back. Then, PLAY.
          Just STATIC. Then we hear Victoria's end of a
          conversation we already witnessed:

          Then the static for a moment filled with GARBLED SOUNDS.
          Victoria hits STOP. She stares. Makes an adjustment,
          plays the SOUNDS again. Something drawing her in...

          INT. WORK HANGAR, RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          A Large bay, filled with machinery, computers. Other
          things scavenged from the wreck of the Odyssey including
          several Delta Sleep Pods. Scav Soldiers work in the
          center of the bay on a DOWNED DRONE. It's been opened
          up, taken apart. All of its circuit boards and wiring
          spread out, hooked to computers.
          To the side, other soldiers are grouped around something.
          Jack tracks the object they're working on: The scarred
          STEEL CYLINDER Jack saw on the Odyssey. Its been opened
          up and some ten scavenged Deuterium fuel cells have been
          fitted inside the casing.

          The bomb...
          She REALIZES something, wheels on Beech, angry.

          You brought down the Odyssey. You
          sonofabitch you crashed our ship.

          on board, what was it for? Tell
          him.
          She looks at Jack, reluctant to say it, but...

                         JULIA
          The Tet... is an alien ship, Jack.
          The odyssey's mission --- Our

          I was born there!

                         BEECH
          I was born in Chicago, Jack. I
          used to go to baseball games with
          my father. I used to get two big
          hot dogs, fill 'em up with relish,
          and mustard. Just go to town. Me
          and my pops, watching the sox.
          (quick, pressing)
          You have any memories like that
          Jack?

          What?

                         BEECH
          My mother, smelled like warm
          fruit. Like oranges, sitting in
          the sun.
          Jack starts to speak... Stops. Beech moves to one of
          the scavenged DELTA SLEEP PODS, runs his hand over the

          The Tet is an alien vessel,
          Commander Jack Harper. It came
          and destroyed our moon and most of
          humanity when it did. And ever
          since, with your help, it's been

          We didn't win the war, Jack. We

          These words hit Jack. He starts to reply, finds he

                         BEECH (CONT'D)
          It has taken us ten years to get
          here, but we finally have a
          weapon, and a working Drone to
          carry it. Except we can't

          No. I won't do it.

          (back to Beech)
          If the Rover found us, the Drones

                         (IGNORING SYKES)
          What's your plan, Jack? Tell the
          Tet where we are, so they can send
          a nice big welcome --

                         JACK
          The Drones would kill you. Let me
          try to stop that.

                         SYKES
          You can't trust him!

                         JACK
          (staying on Beech)
          You're wasting time.
          On Beech, Sykes...

          TNT. RAVEN ROCK - MOMENTS LATER
          Jack and Julia stand near the entrance to Raven Rock.
          Sykes appears with the white rectangular box, tosses it
          down in the dirt at Jack's feet.
          Beech watches as Jack unfolds his motorcycle. Behind
          them, other Scavs are packing up, readying an exodus.

                         JACK
          I can fix this.

                         BEECH
          Well, you're the repairman.
          Jack powers up the bike and gets on. He looks at Julia
          who hesitates, then she climbs on the back of the bike.

                         JACK
          I'll get to the antenna, send a
          signal with my location. The Tet
          will call off the search. .You
          should be safe, for now.
          Jack starts to go.

                         BEECH
          Jack... What if I told you that I
          had been to your radiation zones.
          And what I found there... Would
          change everything you think you
          know about the world.

          72.

                         CONTINUED:
          Jack looks at him, hearing this. Then GUNS the bike.
          Beech stares after them, the rooster-tail of Jack's bike
          racing away across the ruined landscape.

                         SYKES
          What makes you think he's any
          different from the others?
          Beech stares at him a moment, then back out.

                         BEECH
          She does.
          Beech turns away.

          EXT. THE RUINED EARTH - DAY

          Jack pilots the electric bike across STAGGERING
          BEAUTIFUL VISTAS... LANDSCAPES OF THE IMAGINATION. On
          the back of the bike, Julia takes in the incredible
          beauty around her.
          Finally, in the shadow of a jagged mountain, the BIKE
          slows and STOPS. Jack checks the charge: it's dead.
          They climb off and Jack leaves the bike where it lies,
          headed off on foot.

                         JULIA
          What happened...?
          She's staring into the distance where an old WRECK of a
          RESOURCE GATHERER lies shattered against a cliff-face.

                         JACK
          The Scavs brought it down ten
          years ago. All. this time, I
          thought we were at war with the
          Scavs... but it turns out we were
          just killing each other.
          He turns, heads off on foot. After a moment, she
          follows.

          EXT. CLIFF TOP - DAY

          Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what
          looks like a METAL SPIRE protruding upwards at its edge.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CONTINUED:
          We PASS OVER them, staring down a familiar 1,200-foot
          waterfall. Jack has returned to the top of the Empire
          State, this time approaching from above.
          Together, they climb DOWN the craggy rock face. Two tiny
          figures against a massive backdrop, a mortal fall below.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

          Jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the
          deck. He moves forward, pulling the plastic and
          camouflage off the transmitter and repeater. He gets to
          work on the repeater. It's old tech, hard to make it
          talk to the Bubbleship.
          Julia stands a ways off. For a moment, their gazes meet,
          then he continues working.

          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - DAY

          Victoria is hard at work, processing the sound that
          caught her attention. She has it playing through the
          whole sky tower: The SOUNDS are broken, static-like,
          almost ALIEN. Strange and guttural.
          Fingers fly over controls, making adjustments. This time
          the sounds parse into WORDS. A male and a female voice.
          Almost apprehensive, she pulls an electronic filter,
          overlays it on the signal, which suddenly drops into
          perfect clarit : A recording of Jack and Victoria, from
          a different patrol.

                         VICTORIA'S VOICE

                         (LAUGHING)
          .And I want a dishwasher, the
          kind that you can put --

                         JACK'S VOICE
          I don't think they'll have those
          on Mars, Honey.

                         VICTORIA'S VOICE
          Okay, fine. No dishwasher. How
          about just you. All the time.

                         JACK'S VOICE
          Yes. When we get there.
          ON VICTORIA. Her face totally still. Strangely frozen
          in the face of this sweet little exchange...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         CONTINUED:
          And then a SOB breaks from her lips. The kind you can't
          control. Her fingers SHAKING, BADLY, she plays the
          recording, puts it on a loop.

          TNT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          The voices BOOM through the Sky Tower, over and over.
          Frightening that their simplicity contrasts so much with
          the effect they are having on Victoria who moves into the
          main room, white as a sheet. She looks up as..
          The Bubbleship lifts off from its platform and sails
          into the sky. She watches it go, then rushes back
          towards her station.

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

          Jack stares at the ESB Antenna, down at the repeater and
          the line of code he hopes he's transmitting.

                         JULIA
          What will you do now?
          Jack doesn't answer. He moves to the edge of the deck,
          stares out, unwilling to meet her eyes.

                         JACK
          That old man is smart. Those fuel
          cells, the way he's got them tied
          in with your device... He could
          blow the whole station.

                         JULIA
          Jack, you can't turn them in.
          He glances at her, shakes his head.

                         JACK
          What do you want from me? I'm
          just a repairman.

                         (BEAT)
          This is bigger than me.
          Jack moves off to a corner of the deck by the old
          telescope. She follows him, steeling herself.

                         JULIA

                         (CAREFULLY)
          You and I started the same year at

          NASA.

          It wasn't really about space for
          me, it was about... what could be
          out there. Life...

                         JACK
          Look, stop, okay? Just --

                         JULIA
          But for you, it was always the
          stars. You wanted to fly further
          and faster than any one else.

                         JACK
          I don't know who you're talking

                         ABOUT --

                         JULIA
          I'm talking about a man I knew,
          who was fearless. A man who
          wouldn't bow out of a fight, ever.

                         JACK
          STOP! You and that old man have
          this story... Except I know who I
          am, okay? I know who I am!

                         JULIA
          No, you don't. That thing
          brainwashed you, it erased your

                         MEMORIES
          He turns, starts to lean on the old telescope, draws
          back, staring at the thing like it bit him.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          That's right... What do you
          remember?
          INTERCUT: The auto-piloted Bubbleship skims over the
          surface of downtown, headed towards the Empire State...
          Jack is staring at the telescope, agitated, confused.

                         JACK
          Why do I... what is it about this
          place?

                         JULIA
          Ten days before we got our go-

          INTERCUT: VICTORIA. Eager to find out where the
          Bubbleship is headed, she punches up the live feed.
          Julia comes close, puts a hand out, rests it on his
          chest. She moves closer to him, searching his eyes.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          Don't you remember what happened
          here?
          INTERCUT: The Bubbleship now moving UP the waterfall.
          Victoria, leaning forward, watching the feeds...
          Julia takes one of his hands, places it around her waist.
          Moves closer still...

                         JACK
          When I sleep. You're always

          She kisses him.

          EXT. OBERVATION DECK - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A YOUNGER JULIA is staring out over glorious intact New
          York City. Next to her, a YOUNGER JACK peers through the
          telescope. Now he pulls away, turns to her...

                         YOUNGER JACK
          There, right there. Take a look.
          She smiles, puts her eye to the telescope.

          The tall billboard, with the girl
          on it.

                         YOUNGER JULIA
          Oh, okay. I don't understand.
          YOUNGER JACK nervously produces an ENGAGEMENT RING from
          his pocket.

                         YOUNGER JACK

          VRROOOOOM! THE SOUND OF A BUBBLE SHIP...

          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY (PRESENT)

          VROOOOMMMM! The Bubbleship RISES INTO VIEW directly in
          front of them. Jack, kissing Julia, tries to break away,
          confused, guilty. Julia holds on.
          She reaches to her collar, pulls free a necklace, a
          familiar ring dangles from it...

                         JULIA
          There are a few pages missing, but
          it's the same book.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria stares at the screen, the image of Jack kissing
          Julia, then breaking away. She's strangely cold, like
          there's simply nothing left to feel...

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack pilots the ship, a tense silence between he and
          Julia. He checks a few readouts, then hits the Comm.

                         JACK
          Vika, it's me. I'm... all right.
          I'm coming in. Don't report in to
          Mission, not until I get back.
          No response. Dead air. Julia is pressed far back in her
          seat, watching Jack.

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria is still motionless. She hears Jack's calls on
          the Comm, does nothing.

                         JACK'S VOICE
          .I'm 20 minutes out.

          Victoria. pushes away from the console, numb. As she
          leaves the room, we STAY on the console...
          which suddenly comes alive. Readouts go active, data
          history starts to play. The Tet is accessing everything.
          Visual and Voice recordings blaze by. Images, everything
          the Bubbleship has seen. We see the image of Raven Rock
          sent from the ROVER.

          INT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS

          Victoria enters the Sky Tower, staring at it as if it was
          all alien to her. As she moves through, she unzips her
          jumpsuit, steps out of it, moves on. Her shirt, then
          bra, land on the floor. She moves on...

          EXT. SKY TOWER - TWILIGHT

          JULIA and JACK step out of the Bubbleship, head towards
          the interior of the Sky Tower. The whole thing has been
          opened up. Wind blows freely through papers, magazines.
          Vases have been blown over, water spilled.

          EXT. SKY TOWER, GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

          Jack comes out near the garden. It's been ripped to
          shreds. What plants are left lie uprooted and broken.
          Flowers strewn about. PETALS float off the side of the
          sky tower and down into the clouds.
          VICTORIA stands near the far edge, looking out. She's no
          longer in her jumpsuit. She wears a beautiful flowing
          dress which waves in the wind. Her hair is free.

                         JACK
          Vika... the Scavs. They're
          humans, like us. The war has

          (shaking her head)
          Stay away from me with the truth!
          I don't want the truth. I
          preferred oblivion.
          Victoria looks up, sees Julia in the distance...

                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)
          You never really loved me, did
          you, Jack?
          His silence is LOUD. She LAUGHS, tears flowing...

                         JACK
          (broken for her)
          Vika, she was my wife.
          She looks at the infinite sky, the clouds, and as the TET
          appears... He steps towards her and she backs towards
          the edge.

                         VICTORIA
          I told them. The drones will be
          here. For her. For you.

          80.

                         CONTINUED:
          Jack feels the sting of this betrayal, but quickly
          accepts it.

                         JACK
          Then come with me.
          (she shakes no)
          Don't you see what it means?
          There are still people, living on
          Earth. Surviving on earth.
          People like us.
          Victoria hears that and laughs, bitter.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Vika?
          Her laughter dies. She looks at him, strangely calm,
          beautiful in this moment.

                         VICTORIA
          Oh, Jack. I think they made us.
          Victoria steps backwards. Jack LUNGES forward.

                         JACK

                         NOOO1
          PETALS are falling towards us from the skytower, and
          then, so is VICTORIA.

          EXT. SKY TOWER CONTINUOUS

          Jack stares after Victoria for one terrible beat, then
          falls to his knees. Not yet feeling, in shock. Julia
          approaches, slowly...
          He turns at her so fast she's afraid and steps back but
          he blows right by her, into

          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack enters Victoria's station. Trespassing in a space
          that doesn't belong to him. His eyes play over the room:
          A cup of coffee, now cold. A jacket on the back of her
          chair. On a monitor, a wavelength plays silently. The
          signal she descrambled.
          He looks at the Tet Communication Device. We realize
          he's never spoken directly to the Tet before.

          voice!
          Beat. Beat. Tet Comm Status: "Communication Ended."
          He stares at this last transmission. Then looks up to
          the big map. From all over the sector, DRONES are
          closing on the Sky Tower. Closing on him.

          EXT. SKY TOWER, BUBBLESHIP PAD - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack comes back out, heading towards the ship. Julia
          puts out a hand to him.

                         JACK
          We have to go.

          TNT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          Jack and Julia streak across the sky in the Bubbleship.
          On the heads-up display, they can clearly see the
          radiation border marked RED in front of them, and the two
          DRONES closing behind them.

                         JULIA
          Where are we going?

                         JACK
          Beech said to look in the
          radiation zones. I have to go
          there.

                         JULIA
          And if he's just a crazy old man?
          Jack looks at her. It'd be a funny moment, but it's not.

                         JACK
          I've been wrong about everything
          else.
          He dives the ship towards the clouds below.

          EXT. CANYON - MORNING

          Drones shoot down a canyon towards RAVEN ROCK.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

          The Bubbleship BURSTS through clouds. Up ahead, the
          familiar RIDGELINE is approaching...

          AND THREE DRONES WATTTNG.
          Jack HAULS the ship over as the Drones bear down on them
          OPENING UP. We recognize one: Drone 166.
          Canon fire ROCKS the Bubbleship, pieces blowing off.
          Jack REVOLVES THE CANOPY to return fire. A Drone
          EXPLODES but Drone 166 and another blast through the
          smoke, firing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

          INT. RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS

          Everything has been packed, loaded, ready to leave.
          Beech watches Sykes supervise the final lashing of the
          BOMB onto a sled. Beech gives a command and the great
          steel door groans OPEN, revealing...
          SIX DRONES, waiting. Their weapons POWERING UP.
          ON BEECH, a final realization washing over him.

          EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS

          Jack SPINS the ship, evading pursuit, even as he checks
          his heads-up, tracks the two Sky Tower Drones closing
          from behind. He hauls over, pursuing Drones turning with
          him, firing as the two Drones burst out of cloud cover
          FAST, MID-AIR COLLISION, two more Drones go down!
          Jack hits the brakes. Another Drone overshoots him,
          pulls up. Jack sites the Drone, starts to fire...
          The Bubbleship is raked with fire! Drone 166 is right on
          them and firing. The canopy is hit! CRACKS spider-web
          across it. A canon is blown clean off.
          Jack tries his remaining weapon. It's dead.

                         WITH DRONE 166
           It pulls out of an arc, ACCELERATES, closing on the
           Bubbleship as the Bubbleship tears away into a cloud
           bank, goes in. Drone 166 follows, seconds behind.
          Drone 166 EMERGES from the cloud bank into open air, its
          cannon lining on... nothing. Empty sky. It REVOLVES
          quickly, sensing for ...
          SMASH! Jack's Bubbleship IMPACTS the Drone from above,
          the ship's manacles designed for transporting broken
          Drones CLAMPING ON. Suddenly the two vessels are LOCKED.
          And the Drone goes wild. It's engines THRUSTING,
          fighting against the counter-force of the Bubbleship's
          engines. The Drones GUNS BLASTING in every direction,
          but unable to elevate to hit the Bubbleship.
          INSIDE THE BUBBLESHIP. Julia screams as the ship tumbles
          end over end. Jack stays on the controls, tracking the
          last Drone closing from above.

                         CONTINUED:
          Jack FORCES Drone and ship to turn, turning Drone 166's
          canon on the last Drone which EXPLODES.

                         JACK
          There...
          He punches the throttle. The Bubbleship with Drone 166
          attached blasts in the direction of A CLIFF FACE.
          DRONE 166 gets free of one restraint, rotates so its
          cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage. OPENS
          UP, blasting the storage to bits...
          And Jack PULLS UP, just clearing the ridge, Drone 166
          IMPACTING ROCK. The Drone blasts clear through, CRASHES

          ONTO VOLCANIC ROCK.

          INT. THE BUBBLESHIPP - CONTINUOUS

          Jack and Julia in the damaged, smoking, now-shaking ship.

                         JACK
          You okay?

                         JULIA
          No.
          Jack nods, turns the ship north again. The Bubbleship
          shaking and smoking. Up ahead, the RIDGELINE
          approaching.
          WARNING ALARMS trigger on the Bubbleship's display
          Claxon-like.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          What is that?

                         JACK
          Radiation warning. We're five
          clicks from the border.
          Jack makes an adjustment, the Bubbleship SURGES with more
          speed. It sounds like it's going to tear itself apart.

          EXT. ROCKS NEAR CRATER LAKE - CONTINUOUS

          The smashed Drone 166 POWERS BACK UP. A moment as it
          runs its systems, then BLASTS OFF in pursuit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS

           On the heads-up, they can see Drone 166 coming up behind
          them, closing FAST. Jack touches a familiar button. The
          Bar-guage for his extra boost starts to fill...
          FROM BEHIND THEM, blasts go wide. Drone 166 is firing,
          missing.
          The bar gauge FALTERS, something broken. Jack SLAMS the
          dash. Gauge keeps rising. The Bubbleship starts to buck
          as RED WARNING TEXT STREAMS ACROSS THE CANOPY: "LETHAL

          RADIATION LEVELS APPROACHING. DO NOT ENTER."

                         JULIA
          Jack...

                         JACK
          I got this.
          Jack hits it. They're both propelled back into their
          seats. The radiation zone coming up fast... They CROSS

          INTO THE ZONE!!
          .and the Bubbleship goes completely DEAD.
          Jack works controls, punches at the display. But there's
          nothing. Just the whistling sound of wind...

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Bob! BOB! What are you doing
           Bob!!!!!
           Bob just bobbles... BLAM! BLAM BLAM!! The blasts from
          Drone 166 impact them, helpless.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          Hold on!!
          Jack grabs a level, a mechanical lever, and HAULS IT UP.
          THE COCKPIT OF THE SHIP SEPARATES FROM THE BODY. The
          dead body of the ship tumbles backwards as Drone 166
           BLASTS IT, tries to pull up but the Bubbleship IMPACTS
          Drone 166 which SPINS OUT OF CONTROL towards the ground.
          THE BUBBLESHIP COCKPIT skims the surface, IMPACTS a
          ridge, blasting through it. It hits another ridge, the
          canopy shattering, earth piling in on them as they
          finally grid to a stop.
          Jack groans, leans to checks that Julia is okay. She's
          coughing, dazed, but alive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          EXT. RADIATION ZONE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack opens the canopy door. It falls off. He stumbles
          out, himself still dazed. Wind and sand blow around him.
          CLOSE ON JACK. He breathes in. Breathes again. Waiting
          for a painful death, that doesn't arrive.

                         JACK
          Son of a bitch, old man...
          Words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke
          from the downed Drone 166, lifting over a nearby ridge.
          He turns back to the ruined ship, grabs his carbine.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Stay here.
          Jack runs towards the smoke which is already being blown
          clear by a rising sand storm. He flops down in the dirt
          at the top of the rise, bringing his weapon up.
          JACK'S POV - DRONE 166. It lies smashed and smoking at
          the bottom of an incline. Finally dead. The wind and
          sand are beginning to whistle now, growing intensity...
          Jack starts to stand... when a FAMILIAR SOUND makes him
          turn.

          THAT OF A BUBBLESHIP.
          Jack hits the dirt as A BUBBLESHIP, just like Jack's,
          screams overhead and lands next to the DRONE, in a moment
          eerily reminiscent of the first scene of the film.
          Below, a MAN gets out of the second Bubbleship. He wears
          the same kind of suit as Jack. ANOTHER REPAIR MAN. He's
          got a bandana wrapped around his lower face to shield him
          from the sandstorm.
          Jack reaches for his BINOCS, bring them to his face only
          to find the lenses shattered.
          Reaching the downed Drone, the MAN kneels next to it and
          in a familiar fashion begins utilizing his tools to fix
          Drone 166. He locks a damaged cannon back into place,
          tightens it...
          Jack suddenly realizes what the man's doing. He stands,
          the wind now blasting in his direction, he starts running
          down the hill towards the man.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Hey! Hey, wait! Stop! Don't
          touch that Drone!
          His words are eaten up by the wind and sand. He rushes
          forward.
          WITH THE REPAIRMAN. We only see his hands as he works on
          Drone 166. He's very good. Even in the growing
           sandstorm he clips out a ruined board, slots a new one
          in. Runs a by-pass around a wire-bundle.
          The Repairman's fingers go to a familiar switch to
          activate the Drone...

                         JACK'S VOICE
          No! Wait!
          The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the
          switch. He LEAPS BACK, spinning around, his carbine
          coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who

          STARES BACK AT HIM IN UTTER ASTONISHMENT.
          JACK'S POV -- THE REPAIRMAN. Holding the weapon on him.
          The man is Jack. A cleaner, newer, but identical version
          of Jack... A CLONE.
          Jack stares, transfixed. Now it all makes sense: The
          Garbled transmissions, Victoria's last words, who or what
          he really is, and is not.
          Not so for Jack 2. He takes a step back, confused,
          horrified. A tense moment.

                         JULIA'S VOICE
          Jack!?
          Julia has just crested the rise, sees the two Jack's.
          Also understanding...

                         JACK
          Julia! Stay back!
          Jack 2 senses her movement, SPINS and AIMS his rifle as
           Jack rushes forward --

                          JACK (CONT'D)
          No!
          -- He HITS JACK 2 and they both go down, the weapon
           FIRING! They fight over the weapon.

                         CONTINUED: ( 2)
          Blow for blow combat, their physical strength and
          training identical, the only exception being that JACK 2
          is fresh, his suit immaculate, a man who has just arrived
          at work, maybe just arrived on the planet.
          WITH JULIA. Standing, watching the two clones fight...
          she suddenly drops to her knees, her hand on her side.
          Blood seeps between her fingers. She's been shot, badly.
          WITH JACK AND JACK 2. Jack grapples with Jack 2, trying
          to control him...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          STOP! You have to understand! You
          have to understand...
          Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to
          throttle him, in a full panic. Jack drives up into his
          gut, rolls away.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           We're just Drones! We're just
           Drones, man! You and me! Don't
           you get it? Don't you know?
          Jack 2 comes at Jack wildly, emotion over-amping
           technique. Jack DUCKS the blow, wraps Jack 2 up in a
          choke-hold. SQUEEZING...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          It's okay. It's going to be
          okay...
          Jack 2 goes limp, unconscious. Jack lets him go,
          staggers back. Everything finally processing. Then:

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Julia...
          He turns towards Julia, sees her kneeling there, holding
          her side. The blood seeping between her fingers...
          JACK runs to her as she begins to fall. She is conscious,
          but just barely. But still, she PULLS BACK from him.

                         JULIA

                         (HORRIFIED)
          Don't touch me. Don't
          She lurches away from him, body running on fear and
          adrenaline. Jack nods, accepting her terror of him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         CONTINUED: ( 3)
          He moves forward, lifts her up against her willand
          carries her to shelter among the rocky terrain closeby.

          EXT. SMALL ROCKY ENCLAVE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack sets her down. There's blood frosting her lips and
          her skin has gone pale. He looks back, sees the
          Bubbleship and Jack 2's form lying next to it. He
          realizes something.

                         JACK
          I'll be back for you.

          INT. BUBBLE SHIP 2 - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack climbs in, looks around at the interior of the ship,
          at the similarities. He stares out at the unconscious
          Jack 2 in front of the ship.

                         JACK

                         (EMPTY WORDS)
          One, Two, Three. Jack Harper.
          A moment... then lights sparkle across the board.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Okay... Let's go home.
          The Bubbleship 2 lifts off.

          INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY (LATER)

          ON JACK. Making the approach. And then he sees it:
          Another Sky Tower, just like his. It had to be there.
          The Bubbleship closes on this new Sky Tower.

          EXT. SKY TOWER 2, GARDEN - DAY

          A woman we know but do not know is starting her new
          garden. VICTORIA 2. She looks happier, a little younger
          and more radiant than the Victoria we knew. It's earlier
          in their tour.
          Victoria 2 looks up as the Bubbleship lands. SMILES as
           Jack gets out and crosses the bridge towards her.

                         VICTORIA 2
          You're early...

                         CONTINUED:
          As he approaches she notices his damaged environmental
          suit.

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
          What happened out there? I lost
          contact.
          JACK stares at her, heartbroken.

                         JACK
          .Just a bit of a dust up.

                         VICTORIA 2
          Are you all right?
          He nods. She comes over to him. He marvels at her
          beauty, the simplicity of life here...

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)

                         (SELF-CONSCIOUS)
          .What?
          She comes close, brushes his hair away from his forehead.

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
          You dreamed a lot last night. I
          was thinking, you have to start
          writing them down.

                         JACK
          I cut myself, I just came by
          for...

                         VICTORIA 2
          I'll get it.

                         JACK
          No, I'll get it.
          He kisses her. Gentle, loving...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I'll get it. You stay here.
          And as JACK goes into the sky tower, she returns to
          happily planting her roses. Oblivious.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, WORK AREA - MOMENTS LATER

          As Jack heads through his work area he sees A COLLECTION.
          Just started, but not much different from his own.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Some coins, a book, THE COLLECTED POEMS OF T.S. ELLIOT,
          left open to a page, a passage underlined. He reads:
          We shall not ceasefromexploration
          And the end of allourexploring
          will be to arrivewherewe first started
          and know the placeforthe first time.
          He nods, strangely moved, moves on.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS

          He grabs the healant and wand. He shuts the cabinet,
          stares at his reflection in the burnished steel.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2, READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          He opens the door to the locker. Stares at the brand-
          new, unworn picture of he and Victoria, taped to the
          inside of the door.

          INT. SKY TOWER 2 - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack comes out into the living area of Sky Tower 2,
          noticing everything: The furniture, the big things are
          exactly the same, but the little personal touches, the
          smaller details are different.
          He sees it all in a different light now. Things that he
          never looked twice at before. The items used to keep
          them from the truth.
          Victoria 2 comes in from outside, washes her hands.

                         VICTORIA 2
          We should watch a movie tonight.
          He sits, looking around himself. He belongs here. He
          fits here. Victoria munches on something.

                         VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
          I was going over the catalog and
          there's still a bunch of your
          favorites I haven't seen...
          She glances over, smiles. Who wouldn't forget everything
          for that smile?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack stares down as the Bubbleship LIFTS OFF from Sky
          Tower 2. He sees Victoria 2 come out, looking at him
          puzzled. Then she moves towards her Control Station.
          After a moment, her voice comes over the Comm.

                         VICTORIA 2
          Hey, you didn't say goodbye.

                         JACK

                         (BEAT)
          Good bye...
          He turns the Bubbleship, towards

          EXT. RADIATION ZONE - DAY

           Jack touches down in the second Bubbleship. Drone 166
          still lies there, but Jack 2 is GONE.

          EXT. SMALL ROCKY ENCLAVE - DAY

          Jack clambers into the enclave to where he left Julia.
          She's passed out, she looks dead. There's blood on the
          ground around her.
          He pulls her into his lap, pulling away the clothing
          around the wound. As he does, her eyes flutter open.
          She's delirious, eyes fixing on him.

                         JACK
          This is gonna pinch a little.

                         JULIA

                         (NOT PROCESSING)
          Okay...
          He spreads the HEALANT over her wound, activates it. For
          a moment, nothing. Then the skin starts to knit.
          And Julia starts to SCREAM...

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - LATER

          Julia is unconscious, propped in the passenger seat of
          the ship. Jack climbs in, jams Bob the Bobblehead onto
          the dash. It bobbles at him, ready.
          Jack hits the gas and the Bubbleship lifts into the air.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY

          The Bubbleship soars through the sky. There's something
          particularly calm, picturesque, exquisitely beautiful
          about the earth below.
          Jack pilots. In the seat next to him, Julia is pale,
          propped against the canopy, recovering. She watches him.
          He's aware of her gaze, but he doesn't look over.

          INT. CRATER LAKE, GROTTO - SUNSET

          Julia weakly stands amidst the tarped supplies, aware
          she's trespassing somewhere utterly private. Outside,
          the sound of Jack splitting wood. She takes in the
          books, the records, the mementos of the past. Sees the
          Jammer up and working...
          Jack comes in, gets to work piling wood in the fireplace.
          He won't meet her eyes. Scared of himself, ashamed in
          front of her...

                         JACK
          I always thought that plateau up
          there could be for a house
          someday. I thought about
          remaining here, letting the rest
          of humanity run off to Mars. And
          we'd just stay here.
          Jack stops himself, realizing how easily he said "we."

                         JULIA
          I'm sorry. Jack...

                         JACK
          No.
          He moves away from her, lights the fire, it starts to
          crackle. He gets up and goes, walking down to the lake.
          She stands near the fire, glad for its warmth, watching
          him out there, silhouetted in front of the lake.
          WITH JACK. He stares out over the water. Letting the
          truth wash over him.
          And then MUSIC from the grotto... the opening bars to the
          Temptation's "My Girl."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          INT. GROTTO, CRATER LAKE -- NIGHT

          Julia stands by the record player, watching the disc
          revolve. She looks up when Jack's form appears in the
          doorway. He's been out there too long, cold.

                         JULIA
          He loved this song.
          Jack sits, shivering, looking out at the lake. She moves
          to him, wraps a blanket around him.

                         JACK
          What was he like?

                         JULIA
          He was arrogant, and annoying, and
          the best man I'd ever known.
          Some distant part of Jack smiles at that.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          .And I loved him.

                         JACK
          I'm not that man.

                         JULIA
          Shhhhh. Yes you are.
          She rests her head against on his shoulder, holds him.
          Simple, caring. His eyes... close.

          INT. MISSION CONTROL, NASA - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

          A group of ASTRONAUTS and NASA CONTROLLERS are
          celebrating. A television screen reads: "Odyssey Mission
          a GO!"
          A YOUNGER JACK and JULIA are among the people
          celebrating. As an ASTRONAUT pops champagne, Jack and
          Julia find a private alcove, he lifts out the engagement
          ring that she wears on the necklace around her neck...

                         YOUNGER JACK
          We should just tell everybody.

                         YOUNGER JULIA
          No, when we come home...
          They KISS...

          TNT. A DARK ROOM - NIGHT
          Their bodies entwined. Kissing, touching. Clothing
          pulled away. Staring into each other's eyes.

          INT. NASA CREW APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN

          Younger Jack stares out the window at the Odyssey on its
          launchpad in the distance. Steam rolls off its engines.
          It's being readied to launch.

                         YOUNGER JULIA
          Hey...
          He looks over, smiles. She's naked under the sheets,
          happy, smiling back at him.

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - MORNING (PRESENT)

          Jack's eyes blink open. Julia is asleep near him,
          peaceful. He turns, stares into the lightening morning
          sky. The Tet rising with the sun.

          EXT. CRATER LAKE -- MORNING

          Jack walks to the water's edge. He stares at the
          reflection of the Tet in the glassy surface of the lake.
          And under that, a fish, nibbling algae...
          He smiles at the fish.

          JULIA (O.S. )
          Good morning.
          He turns. She's there, arms held around herself against
          the chill of morning. They look at each other, so much
          to be said.

                         JACK
          We can't stay here.
          She smiles, nods.

          INT. BUBBLESHIP 2 - DAY

          Jack and Julia fly low over terrain. As the Bubbleship
          crests a rise and drops down into a steep canyon, she
          takes his hand. He glances at her, lets his hand stay in
          hers. The entrance to Raven Rock looms ahead...

          His eyes narrow. There's SMOKE, drifting from inside
          Raven Rock.

          EXT. RAVEN ROCK - DAY

          As the Bubbleship touches down, the carnage becomes
          clear. A few shattered DRONES lie here and there, but
          there are bodies and smoking blast points everywhere.
          JACK grabs his carbine, heading inside.

                         JACK
          Stay here...

          INT. RAVEN ROCK - DAY

          As Jack moves into the darkness of the ruined Raven Rock,
          his suit's lights blaze on. He moves in, weapon ready.
          Bodies are everywhere, blasted to pieces.
          FIRES still burn here and there. Paint bubbles on
          burning canvas. Records melt and drip in the heat...
          Jack turns a corner, finds Sykes STARING AT HIM! But his
          eyes are dead. Sykes still holds a spear implanted in a
          Drone's wrecked body.
          A FLICKERING LIGHT draws Jack's attention.

          INT. RAVEN ROCK, CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          BEECH is slumped in a chair, blastburnt, clutching a
          charred black box in his arms. His eyes half-lidded, he

                         STARES AT:
          Newsreel footage, from when the Tet arrived. On the
          screen crowds stare, the UN meets, Cults form.
          THE MOON in the sky, its surface VIBRATES, then starts to
          come apart. People SCREAM... Cutting to War Footage.
          Alien Troop-ships touching down, their design distinctly
          Tet-like. They discharge waves of warriors...
          CLOSE ON: Hand held, war-journalism. We see the alien
          soldiers pushing back resistance. All of them are
          versions of Jack. One sights the cameraman, BLAM! Blows
          him away. Camera hits dirt..
          SMASH! Jack is there next to Beech. He's just pushed
          the projector over.

          The first ones were soldiers,
          programmed only to kill.
          Beech slowly, painfully, looks at him. Little emotion in
          Beech, just resigned recognition.

          Later, there were new versions.
          More... creative. The Tet needed
          something different. And finally
          there was... you.

                         JACK
          I'm the weapon of this war.
          BEECH smiles sardonic, nods.

                         BEECH
          The Tet. The clockmaker God.
          Such brilliant, complex
          machinery... For such a simple
          task. To steal our water, our
          life... all for fuel.

                         (BEAT)
          It doesn't even care about us.
          It's just... effective.

                         JACK
          Why didn't you tell me?

                         BEECH
          Not the kind of news that.

          We lost, Jack. It won.

                         JACK
          The device...?

                         BEECH
          (shaking his head)
          No Drone. It will go on,

          Beech's voice trails off...
          Jack kneels in front of Beech. The old man's eyes are
          open, fixed on the artwork, the remnants of humanity...
          But they don't blink any longer. Beech is dead.
          Jack reaches up, closes Beech's eyes. He removes the box
          from Beech's arms: The flight recorder from the odyssey.

                         JULIA'S VOICE
          There is a way.
          Julia stands in the doorway to the library.

          It wants me. Bring me to it.
          (off his silence)
          I'm right. You know I am. It's
          the only way.

          INT. WORK HANGER, RAVEN ROCK - MOMENTS LATER

          The room destroyed. The disassembled Drone a smoking
          hulk. Jack works in front of an open Delta Sleep Pod
          from the Odyssey. He HAULS the cylindrical BOMB to the
          Pod, slots it into the space for personal effects...

                         JULIA
          Is it ready?
          Julia is standing at the entrance to the room. He nods
          and she approaches, STARES at what will be her coffin.

                         JACK
          Julia...

                         JULIA
          Let's just do it.
          She moves to climb in, then turns to Jack and kisses him.
          It's a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed.
          Finally, it breaks. She backs away, into the Pod, next
          to the BOMB. Trembling as the door starts to CLOSE.
          Suddenly, she's very scared. Fighting back panic.

          The door closes, SEALS. Jack stares down at her through
          the carapace. He puts a hand on the glass. She puts
          hers on the other side.

                         JULIA (CONT'D)
          .I got this.
          He touches a button and a pale gas starts to fill the
          chamber. Julia realizes that this will be her last
          moment of consciousness. Trembling, crying, afraid...

                         JULIA (CONT'D)

          And she falls asleep. Jack stares at her sleeping form.

          EXT. RAVEN ROCK - LATER

          Wind tearing at him, JACK loads the sleep pod onto the
          drone-carrier of the Bubbleship.

          TNT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP, OUTTER ATMOSPHERE - LATER

          The Bubbleship hovers high above the clouds, the Delta
          Pod attached beneath it. Jack STARES down at the earth.
          He hits a control and the ship rotates, so it's facing
          upwards towards the Tet which fills the sky above. Jack
          touches the throttle and the Bubbleship begins to CLIMB.
          Jack has the odyssey flight recorder on the seat next to
          him. He touches a control and THE AUDIO fills the
          canopy. It's distant, fuzzy, recorded from deep space.
          Jack listens as the Tet grows in size in front of him.

          ORIGINAL JACK'S VOICE
          Good morning folks, this is

          So far, from this distance, we're
          still reading zero heat
          signatures, no sign of organic

          Yes, because everyone knows, if
          you want to really know something,
          one hundred kilometers is the best

          Jack touches a control, the sound from the recorder FAST
          FORWARDS. Hours and hours of time on the odyssey fly by.
          The Bubbleship has reached the stratosphere where the
          blue sky gives way to black space. We see the small ship
          detach from the blue curve of earth, the blackness of
          space in front of it.

                         JACK
          Bob, let's prep for outer

          ROW UPON ROW of EMPTY GLASS PODS. He tracks the walls,
          until near him... there are a dozen with Jack and
          Victoria clones still inside.
          BEHIND HIM Drones BLAST away from behind the Bubbleship.
          Jack stares at the clones, LAUGHS morbidly.

                         JACK
          .What Horatius said, what his
          argument was, was this...
          He opens the pod, revealing...
          -- BEECH'S BODY, and on his chest the raw BOMB. The
          nuclear warhead from the odyssey surrounded by ten
          Deuterium fuel cells.

          No.
          BEHIND HIM. The Drones blast away the last bit of the
          Bubbleship, push through...

          EXT. CRATER LAKE - DAY

          A Delta Sleep Pod rests in front of Jack's ruined Grotto,
          near the lake's edge. A TIMER now reaches ZERO.
          The Delta Pod unseals with a HISSS, its door opening.
          Soft daylight falls on Julia's face. Her eyes move under
          their lids, then flicker open..

          INT. THE TET, INCUBATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          Jack sees the DRONES swarming towards him. He starts to
          recite, but falters. He's really scared.

          How can a man die...

          Julia emerges from the Pod, confused, looking around.

          She sees the metal cylinder, releases it and it tumbles
          to the ground.
          She crouches by it, opens it. Whatever she sees moves
          her to tears as IN FRONT OF HER, the form of Drone 166
          rises into view. Its weapons trained on her.
          She looks up, right at it, resigned...

          INT. THE TET, INCUBATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          As the Drones swarm down, Jack closes his eyes, recites
          without embellishment. The way these words were meant to

                         BE SPOKEN:

                         JACK
          How can man die better
          Than facing fearful odds,
          For the ashes of his fathers,
          And the temples of his gods...
          The DRONES are on him, weapons lining!

                         JACK (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING)
          Do you hear me!!!
          Jack pounds the trigger with his fist. As ALL THE CLONES
          open their eyes.
          .and everything is bathed in WHITE LIGHT.

          EXT. THE TET - CONTINUOUS

           The Tet explodes in a MASSIVE DEUTERIUM FISSION
           EXPLOSION, the entire artificial moon killed from within.

           EXT. CRATER LAKE - CONTINUOUS


                         DRONE 166
          falls inert in front of Julia as the Tet
          Explodes in the sky above her. She stares up, tears
          already running down her face.

          EXT. VARIOUS LANDSCAPES - CONTINUOUS

          DRONES fall from the sky, powerless...
          A RESOURCE GATHERER YAWS, losing power, and falls
          ponderously into what remains of the sea...

          EXT. CRATER LAKE. CONTINUOUS

          The explosion is like St Elmo's fire, refracted across
          the sky, all over the face of the earth.
          Julia looks down at her hands which hold: A rolled
          canvas, the only object inside the metal cylinder. She
          unrolls it now. We glimpse a girl lying in golden
          fields, a farmhouse in the distance. The painting from
          Ravens Rock that reminded her of home.
          ON JULIA, weeping, staring at the fire ball in the sky.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          The Tet arrived almost half a
          century ago. And it changed our
          world forever...
          We're at CRATER LAKE, three years in the future.
          The Grotto has been turned into a house, the ground has
          been cultivated. Roses and yellow flowers grow near the
          house. A SOLAR ARRAY powers the spot. All Jack's
          scavenging has gone to very good use. There's a small
          make-shift boat moored at the Lake's edge.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          It was probably surprised, what we
          were willing to do, to survive.
          Jack's basketball sits alone near the hoop.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          We had to unlearn what it meant,
          to call something our home.
          There's a familiar painting, hanging on the wall. The
          girl in the field of wheat, yearning towards home.

          JULIA (V.0.)
          But we did. We started over. And
          so here we are now, everyone
          that's left...

          JULIA is turning over a patch of ground for next year.
          Next to her, A CHILD is digging her fingers through loam.
          The CHILD looks up, stares across the water.

                         JULIA
          Well, almost everyone.
          A MAN stands at the edge of the water, on the opposite
          side. He wears the wrecked remains of a worksuit, and
          carries a pack. It is Jack 2. He's aged three years,
          his hair has grown, his boots are scavenged. He has
          travelled a long way, and we know that as he stares
          across the water, he knows exactly what he is looking at.

                         CHILD
          Who is that?
          ON JULIA. It's been a long journey to this moment for
          her as well. She smiles.

                         JULIA
          It's your father. Come on, let's
          go pick him up.

           An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
           coat moves fearfully along a wall, passing benches strewn
           with broken lab equipment. Her ample bosom heaves as she
           PANTS nervously, mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro.
           Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
           swells. The woman backs into a shadow, not noticing a
           pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her.
           The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
           into the woman's ear. She spins around on her stiletto
           heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness,
           drooling through broken teeth, and lunges at her neck.

                          ZOMBIE
           Brains!

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eleven year-old NORMAN BABCOCK sits on the floor
           watching TV. He has large piercing eyes and a messy shock
           of hair. The movie scene we just witnessed continues off-
           screen with the sound of bloodcurdling SCREAMS.
           Behind him sitting upon a sofa is GRANDMA BABCOCK, a
           plump old lady squinting through thick glasses.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           What's happening now?

                          NORMAN
           The zombie is eating her head,
           Grandma.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           That's not very nice. What's he
           doing that for?

                          NORMAN
           Because he's a zombie. That's what
           they do.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Well he's going to ruin his
           dinner. I'm sure if they just
           bothered to sit down and talk it
           through it'd be a different story.
           Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as
           he hears his father shout from the kitchen.

           too, will ya? My feet are like

           Norman's mother, SANDRA BABCOCK, is emptying the
           dishwasher. She is in her late thirties, and wears `mom'
           clothes that do no favors for her figure. His father,
           PERRY BABCOCK, is older, with a neatly-trimmed beard
           trying hard to delineate chin from neck. He stands on a
           chair, decked out in tool belt and safety goggles, even
           though he's only changing a light bulb in a ceiling
           fixture.
           Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
           an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Hi. Whatcha watching in there?

                          NORMAN
           Sex and violence.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh. That's nice.
           Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage.

           Can't you be like other kids your
           age and pitch a tent in the yard,
           or have a healthy interest in
           carpentry?

                          NORMAN
           I thought you said kids my age
           were too busy shoplifting and
           joyriding?

           Breezing into the kitchen through the back door while
           CHATTING inanely on her cell phone, Norman's older sister
           COURTNEY is fifteen years-old and is the bleached-blonde
           cheerleader archetype of every schoolboy's sordid dreams.

                          COURTNEY
           Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d.
           Like, a seven pack at least.

                          (TO NORMAN)
           Ew! Watch it!
           She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
           garbage outside.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Courtney, be nice.

                          COURTNEY
           Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve
           him. I mean, she's nice and I
           really like her, but she's a
           complete loser. Yeah, I know.
           Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a
           strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger.
           Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a
           moment as if thinking something over.

                          NORMAN
           Dad? Grandma says, "Can you turn
           up the heating?" Her feet are
           cold.
           The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face,
           Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales.

                          COURTNEY
           Oh yeah? Prove it!
           Norman levels her a look that says "you asked for this".

                          NORMAN
           She said it's not very ladylike to
           hide photos of the High School
           quarterback with his shirt off in
           your underwear drawer.
           Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows.

                          COURTNEY
           I knew it! You've been sneaking
           around in my personal stuff!

                          NORMAN
           No I haven't! Grandma told me!

                          COURTNEY
           You are the worst!
           Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the
           kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her.
           Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily
           sympathetic smile.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Norman, I know you and Grandma
           were very close, but we all have
           to move on. Grandma's in a better
           place now.

                          NORMAN
           No she's not, she's in the living
           room.
           Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair.

           Your grandmother was old and sick,

           Oh please, "sensitive" is writing
           poetry and being lousy at team
           sports... not this! I won't have
           him turn out like that uncle of
           yours! If that crazy old tramp has
           been around here putting ideas in
           Norman's head...

           CLOSE ON a faded photograph of Norman, held in the grimy
           hand of MR PRENDERGHAST. He stands over a dusty desk
           scattered with pictures of Norman, Sandra and older
           family members. He is in a dark study; a wall-to-wall
           trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster-dived junk.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           Not much time, not much time...
           He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and
           traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover;
           an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars.
           Wincing with pain, the man drops the book and clutches at
           his chest, COUGHING and GASPING horribly.
           CAMERA PANS to a wall covered in countless photographs,
           newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings. It is a
           shrine of sorts; a madman's recondite genealogy project,
           and at its center is a photograph of Norman, posing with
           his family on vacation.
           ZOOM IN to the photograph, hurtling past the Babcocks and
           through dense trees further and further into a dark
           forest.

           Norman opens bleary eyes, turns off his zombie hand alarm
           clock, and slides out of bed.

           Dressed for school, Norman pauses at the front door and
           turns to look at the sofa in the living room. He waves
           happily, and Grandma smiles back.
           Courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the
           opposite direction. She also stops to look at the sofa,
           but to her eyes it is empty. She sneers contemptuously.

           Norman ambles past houses and lawns spotted with small-
           town America detritus; cheap plastic lawn furniture,
           peeling-paint fences and cookie-cutter topiary. Here the
           quaint colonial buildings are mostly in disrepair, their
           picket fences rotten or daubed in graffiti.

           Norman is watched dubiously by the occasional passer-by
           as he shouts amiable greetings to people who simply
           aren't there.

                          NORMAN
           Good morning! Hey Bruce! How's it
           goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late
           for school. I need to go. Hi, nice
           to see you guys. Good morning.
           Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me.
           Pardon me. See ya.
           At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is
           watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper
           across the other side of the street.
           MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of

           Hey there little buddy! C'mere!
           He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
           face the onlooker, then hurries away.
           Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole
           host of ghosts are meandering through the streets.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Yeah, good to see you! How you
           doin'? Hi Mrs Hardman. You look
           nice today. I like what you've

           A little further along Norman nods pleasantly to the
           ghost of a parachutist impaled in the branches of a
           roadside tree.

                          NORMAN

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Its industrial days now rusted behind it, Blithe Hollow
           has become a run-down tourist town, celebrating its
           heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks. A
           massive billboard beside the main square reads "BLITHE
           HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!" illustrated by a group
           of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
           hanging from a gallows. Across the street a huge banner
           suggests this year is particularly important for the
           town; "BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN' YEARS!"
           The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
           buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
           gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks.
           Everywhere Norman walks, the witch theme is prevalent.
           Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
           "MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM". There's a dingy bar, the BAR
           GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.
           Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black
           woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking
           like he'd rather be elsewhere.

                          SHERIFF HOOPER
           Watch and learn. "Parking
           violation" is my middle name.

                          DEPUTY DWAYNE
           Really? I thought it was Rhona.
           They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly
           in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation.

                         

          12 EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING 12

           Norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat
           school building. Out front, the name "BLITHE HOLLOW
           MIDDLE SCHOOL" is carved into an ugly hunk of granite.
           ParaNorman 9.

                         12 CONTINUED: 12
           SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman; a gauntlet
           of jeering, merciless, pre-pubescent horror. Norman takes
           a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule.
           Most of the kids give him a wide berth, but others sneer
           and WHISPER as he passes.
           A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone
           makes a bee-line for the building.
           Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his
           backpack to the ground. Other kids SNICKER as they step
           over him.
           As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman
           is left alone on the path.
           Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions,
           and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye.
           NORMAN'S POV - Mr Prenderghast, barely visible as he
           stands within the shadow of a tree, stares back at him.
           Norman frowns and squints his eyes, but now sees only
           trees and shadows, so he continues up the steps.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, LOCKERS - MORNING

           An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor, scuffed by scores
           of dragged heels. Rows of dented lockers line the walls.
           Norman stands before his locker, across which someone has
           daubed the word "FREAK" in marker. Clearly something of a
           daily ritual, he reaches inside, takes out a bottle of
           surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off.
           Across the hallway, another kid is removing graffiti from
           his locker. NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair, and
           is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word "FATTY".
           He watches Norman with interest.
           A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start.

                          ALVIN
           Hey, ghost jerk! You know what?
           Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
           grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is
           flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom
           wears a T-shirt emblazoned with "TEAM ALVIN".

           off some more.

           Hey! Hey! Norman!
           Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
           beside him. He swats it flat with his hand.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Talk to that.
           The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           That is so Alvin!
           The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
           damage they've managed to inflict.

                          PUG
           Loser!

                          ALVIN
           That was good, right guys?
           Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as
           anyone might hear.

                          NORMAN
           Flies don't talk.
           Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy,
           but he is already being hurried along by his friend
           SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces.

                          SALMA

           Amidst stacked bleachers, foam mats and stray dodge
           balls, a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
           gymnasium. Mediocre art class scenery represents a
           colonial town, complete with plywood hills, chapel and
           crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop.
           In a director's chair far too small for the job is MRS
           HENSCHER, an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
           looks like she smells of too-much perfume.
           At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
           carrying a large scroll, is NORMAN. He is surrounded by
           kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
           lot to be desired.

           Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any
           of you know anything about the
           history of this town?
           Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed.

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           Puritans were strict and devout
           settlers, who came here to build a
           home, a place without sin. What is
           it now Salma?
           Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
           Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic
           warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased.

                          SALMA
           Why is the witch always a hideous
           old crone with a pointy hat and a
           broomstick? I don't believe it's
           historically accurate, Mrs
           Henscher!
           Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
           She attempts an understanding smile, in the same way a
           shark might.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           It's not supposed to be. It's
           supposed to sell postcards and key
           chains.

           Waving her arms theatrically, she bellows Norman's lines,
           milking every syllable for effect.

           But the vengeful witch cursed her
           accusers, seven of them in all, to
           die a horrible and gruesome death,
           and rise from their graves as the
           living dead; their souls doomed to
           an eternity of damnation!

           Now I want you to try that again,
           but with conviction! My reputation
           is at stake here, and I won't have
           this turn out like that wretched
           Kabuki debacle of oh-nine!
           As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
           in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up,
           and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes.
           Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to
           see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split
           second the children are replaced with faded figures in
           real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures.
           As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion
           of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows...

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           Norman! Are you listening to me,
           boy?
           Norman is brought back to the real world with a start,
           and nods timidly from behind his scroll.

                          NORMAN
           Sorry, Mrs Henscher.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           So am I. Now, unless there's any
           other issues, let us resume...
           They put her on trial and hanged

           Neil turns excitedly to Norman.

           Ooh! This is my moment!
           He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around,
           not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around
           Norman's neck.
           Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
           keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He
           lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from
           under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on
           stage.

           Fresh graffiti reads "SEE YOU TOMORROW, FREAK".
           Norman heads for the door, and pretends not to hear when
           Neil shouts out behind him.

                          NEIL
           Norman, wait up!

           EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER

           Norman keeps going, but Neil quickly catches up, beaming
           intently at the side of his head.

                          NORMAN
           I keep telling you, Neil. I like
           to be alone.

                          NEIL
           So do I. Let's do it together!
           You shouldn't let them get you
           down. They always do stuff like
           that to me.

                          NORMAN
           Why?

                          NEIL
           Because I'm fat. And my allergies
           make my eyes leak. And I sweat
           when I walk too fast. And I have a
           lunchbox with a kitten on it. And
           I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I
           guess there's a whole bunch of
           stuff.

                          NORMAN
           Doesn't it bother you?

           Nah. You can't stop bullying, it's
           part of human nature. If you were
           bigger and more stupid, you'd
           probably be a bully too. It's
           called "survival of the thickest".

           EXT. URBAN STREET - DAY

           Norman and Neil walk away from the school along a tree
           lined street at the end of which stands a huge
           commemorative statue. It is a grotesque effigy of the
           evil witch from the local legend.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (O.S.)
           Psssst!
           The boys stop. It seems to be coming from the witch.

                          NEIL
           That statue just "pissst" at us!
           Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of
           them, startling them as he staggers closer.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           You know who I am?

                          NEIL
           The weird stinky old bum who lives
           up the hill?

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           (points to Norman)
           I was asking him.

                          NORMAN
           Yes. I know. I was told not to
           talk to you. Sorry.
           Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to
           Norman and whispering conspiratorially.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           And you know why you're not
           supposed to talk to me?
           Norman tries to back away.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           I can see ghosts too! And I know
           that's not all you've been seeing
           lately, is it? Bad omens? Things
           you can't quite explain? Strange
           faces peering through the veil?
           Norman's eyes widen further.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           And I'll bet no one told you about
           the witch's curse, did they?

                          NORMAN
           Actually, we're learning about it
           in school..?

                          NEIL

                          (BEAMING PROUDLY)
           I'm a tree!
           Mr Prenderghast impatiently turns his back on Neil and
           leans close to Norman.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           There's something you really need
           to know! This is the most
           important thing you will ever
           hear! The fate of everyone depends
           on it! Now listen close... The
           witch's curse is real, and you're
           the one who has to stop it!
           Mr Prenderghast grabs Norman's arm and leans closer.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           You've gotta use your gift of
           talking to the dead!
           He breaks into a HACKING COUGH, face turning beet red and
           bloodshot eyes bulging.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           Because if you don't the witch's
           ghost...

                          (COUGHING)
           And this is the most important
           thing of all... You have to go up
           to the old graveyard and...

           NEIL (O.S.)
           Leave him alone!
           An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to
           find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open
           in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition.

                          NEIL (CONT'D)
           Don't make me throw this hummus!
           It's spicy!
           Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the
           scene. He HISSES out of the side of his mouth at Norman.

           it soon enough! Watch for the
           sign!
           As he hobbles away, Neil peers down the street after the
           old man.

                          NEIL
           Jeez, what a dirty old creep!

                          NORMAN
           He's my uncle.

                          NEIL
           So is it true?

                          NORMAN
           What?
           Norman just stares at him.

                          NEIL
           Can you see ghosts? Like,
           everywhere? All the time?

                          NORMAN
           Uh, yeah?

                          NEIL
           Awesome! Do you think you can see
           my dog Bub? He was run over by an
           animal rescue van. Tragic and
           ironic. We buried him in the yard.
           Could you see him?
           Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback.

                          NORMAN
           Maybe.

                          NEIL
           Sweet! Come on!

           EXT. NEIL'S DRIVEWAY

           Neil forcibly drags Norman up the front driveway of a
           pastel-painted house. A pair of legs spotted in oil stick
           out from beneath a pimped-up camper van.
           Neil's brother MITCH calls out from under the van.

                          MITCH
           Neil? That you?

           Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play
           with the dead dog in the garden
           and we're not even gonna have to
           dig him up first!
           Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with
           tattooed biceps. The kind of guy who wears year-round
           flip-flops.

                          MITCH
           What'd you say?
           Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman,
           who stands awkwardly a little way away, surrounded by
           cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary.

                          MITCH (CONT'D)
           Neil, isn't he that weird kid?
           Y'know, "Look at me, I talk to
           ghosts so people will pay
           attention to me."
           Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically.

                          NEIL
           Can you stop doing that? It's
           kinda stupid.

                          MITCH
           Now listen to me, you don't need
           to be hanging out with weird
           people. That's a tip.
           Neil scowls at his brother.

                          NEIL
           Don't blow this for me, Mitch.
           This one's not weird. He talks to
           dead people.
           Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his
           brother.

           Neil rummages around in the bushes of his back yard,
           surrounded by a gloriously tasteless menagerie of lawn
           ornaments. Norman stands slightly to one side surveying
           the rows of plastic gnomes and wondering if he should
           have gone straight home after all.

                          NEIL
           He's around here somewhere...

                          (A BEAT)
           So does everyone come back as a
           ghost?

                          NORMAN
           No. My grandma told me it's
           usually people who still have
           stuff to figure out. Or sometimes
           it's the ones who died suddenly,
           or in a bad way.
           A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy
           wagging its tail cheerfully, despite being chopped neatly
           into two halves.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Bub?

                          NEIL
           Is he there? How's he look?
           Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs
           behind to sniff his own backside.

                          NORMAN
           Uh... good.
           Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby
           calves, then doubles back for another try.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           He's happy to see you.

           Can he feel it if I pet him?

                          NORMAN
           Yeah, I guess.
           Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making
           a "coochy-coo" face.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Uh... that's not his chin.
           Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up.
           Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in
           front of Bub's nose, even though he can't see him.

                          NEIL

           and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his
           feet and he bends down to pick it up.

           With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest,
           then keels over backwards, stiffly hitting the floor with
           a THUMP.
           Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of
           him, sculpting his shape in the air.
           With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit
           back in, and he staggers back to his feet.

           He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down
           onto the ground.
           The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body.
           He blinks his eyes, looking around as if he's just been
           woken from a deep sleep, then down at the defunct body
           lying at his feet.

           into his camera.

           Great, now we'll never get to
           remember this moment.
           ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her
           hands theatrically at the other children.

                          SALMA
           I curse you accusers to die a
           horrible and gruesome death and
           rise from your graves as the
           living dead; your souls doomed to
           an eternity of damnation!
           The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead
           begin to menace Salma with their farming implements, and
           begin a slow ominous chant.

                          KIDS
           Kill the witch! Kill the witch!
           Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the
           stage.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Gosh, aren't they adorable?
           Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big
           glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams
           of the gymnasium.
           Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to
           notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache
           branches on Neil's head. It turns to Norman and HOOTS.

           He looks down from it and catches Neil's eye. Neil makes
           a puzzled expression.

           What?

                          KIDS
           Kill the witch! Kill the witch!
           The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows
           dark and thick. The shapes of the audience and the kids
           beside him swim around, blurring like a finger pulled
           through oil paint. The ceiling disintegrates into clouds,
           which CRACKLE with lightning.

                          NORMAN
           (under his breath)
           Oh no! Not again!
           All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and
           through the darkness in the distance are occasional
           lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot
           looked three centuries ago.

           EXT. OLD FOREST - NIGHT

           As Norman turns on the spot GASPING, he hears a RUSTLE in
           the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous
           figures in Pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth.

                          PURITAN
           Witch! We know you're out there!
           Norman stands on a twig which, naturally, CRACKS loudly,
           and the figure turns around and points at him.

                          PURITAN (CONT'D)
           There!

                          NORMAN
           No!

                          PURITAN
           Witch.
           More figures emerge from out of the darkness, wielding
           hayforks. They SHOUT threateningly and, as one man, surge
           toward him. Norman turns and runs.
           The trees around him are shifting, but there's no wind
           blowing the branches. Limbs GROAN as they twist, bearing
           down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape.
           Soon he can run no further, the way ahead tangled up into
           a wall of thorny fingers.

           Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a
           huge tree, and a knothole grimaces at him, wood splitting
           open into a hag-like mouth. It furrows a mossy brow and
           speaks in a low rumbling voice.

                          TREE
           The dead are coming!
           Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away, but the
           pursuing figures are drawing closer, and there's no
           escape.
           A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere.

           NEIL (O.S.)
           Hey buddy! Are you okay?
           Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's
           face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of
           concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS.

           Norman stands next to Neil on stage, eyes closed and
           WAILING. Everyone around him stares in stunned silence
           as, still SCREAMING, he runs into the spotlight.

                          NORMAN

           THE DEAD ARE COMING!
           He continues running directly off the edge of the stage
           and lands on the floor with a THUMP.
           For a moment no one knows quite how to react. Mrs
           Henscher quizzically checks her script.
           Norman's eyes focus and he sees everyone standing around
           him, staring. Sandra pushes through the crowd.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK

           Norman sees their expressions of disgust and suspicion.
           Worst of all, peering around parents' legs with a look of
           shock and fear is Neil. Norman catches his eye a moment,
           and Neil looks down at the ground.

           Barely keeping his fury in check, Perry drives home,
           Norman sitting despondently in the back seat.

           Perry pulls the car up in the Babcock's drive and gruffly
           climbs out of the car.

                          NORMAN
           This is ridiculous. I wish
           everyone could see what I see! I
           didn't ask to be born this way!
           Perry mutters as he slams his door shut.

           Funny, neither did we.
           Norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut.
           His mother hears it too, and leans over her seat with a
           look of sympathy.

           Y'know, sometimes people say
           things that seem mean, but they do
           it because they're afraid.

           to prepare himself for what he knows is going to be a bad

           An overhead bulb casts a dim light over chipped wall
           tiles and yellowed ceramic sinks with leaky faucets.
           The door opens and Norman hurries inside, a number of
           voices still SHOUTING behind him. He shuts the door,
           cutting them off, and leans against it, taking a breath.
           He heads over to the first stall. The door is locked, so
           he takes the next one.
           CLOSE ON Alvin, sitting on the toilet in the next stall
           scribbling obscenities on the wall to pass the time. He
           pauses as he hears the lid drop next door, then resumes
           his vandalism.
           Norman sits on the lid of the toilet, pulling his knees
           up under his chin feeling sorry for himself.

           ANGLE ON toilet paper in an industrial-sized roll. It
           jitters on its mount and begins to turn slowly on its
           own, unspooling sheet by sheet toward the floor. Norman
           frowns and watches as it stops unravelling and a draught
           of wind blows out of nowhere, ruffling his hair.
           The toilet roll suddenly spins violently, flinging the
           paper into the air in reams. The screws holding the
           dispenser to the wall RATTLE fiercely.
           The toilet underneath Norman begins to shake and shudder,
           spilling water over the floor. Norman WAILS loudly as he
           jumps onto the back of the cistern.
           Alvin is frozen in place in his stall, hearing the noises
           and really not sure how to react to them. He glances down
           and sees toilet water leaking across the tiles.
           He quickly pulls up his pants to cover his dignity, and
           jumps up off the toilet with a SQUEAL.
           In Norman's stall everything stops dead and the lid of
           the toilet slowly CREAKS open.
           Norman GASPS as Mr Prenderghast's face stares up at him
           out of the toilet bowl. With some effort the old man's
           ghost shimmies out of the toilet, eventually POPPING out
           like a cork from a bottle, hovering in the air in front
           of Norman's face.

                          NORMAN
           You died?!

           Oh it's you all right! I've been
           holding back the witch's curse for
           years, but now I'm dead. It has to
           be you!

           Before Norman's eyes the bathroom stall and everything
           beyond it is ripped away, revealing thick undergrowth and
           tall trees. Norman is suddenly sat on the toilet in the
           middle of a forest.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           It means the past is coming back
           to haunt you! Time is running out!
           The anniversary of the witch's
           death is tonight. Her ghost is
           going to wake up, and when she
           does she'll raise the dead! You
           gotta keep her in her grave!
           The toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath Norman's
           feet, sculpting skull faces and clutching hands that
           reach for him as he shrinks back.

                          NORMAN
           But I'm just a kid! How am I
           supposed to stop it?
           In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten
           away, the school bathroom reappearing through the holes.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Read from the book at the spot the
           witch was buried!

           Norman looks at the ghost's wispy hands.

           Not these hands, my other hands!
           The me that's at home in my study
           starting to smell a little funny!
           Norman looks sick and overwhelmed, but the ghost doesn't
           let up, swirling right up to his face.

           PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)
           Get the book and read from it!

           Norman pauses a beat. Mr Prenderghast is floating upside
           down, various bits of bathroom detritus orbiting around
           him. A piece of toilet paper dangles off his nose.

           Mr Prenderghast's ghost begins to disappear, bubbling and
           melting at the edges like a burning photograph.

                          NORMAN
           No! Mr Prenderghast, wait!
           Alvin, hearing only Norman's voice, gingerly peeks around
           the corner of his stall.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Sorry kid, I'm done here! I'm
           free! I'm finally free!

           Wait! No, you can't leave now!
           Please! I don't understand.
           Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment, face scrunched
           up as he awaits his release, CACKLING crazily.
           The ghost explodes into a million particles of light,
           blowing open the stall door and catapulting Alvin
           backwards across the room. The mirrors behind him crack
           and the light bulb shatters.
           From the floor, Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman
           framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges.
           He reaches over and flushes the toilet.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Uh... yeah. You might want to give
           that a few minutes.

           you! Keep out of my way!

                          NEIL
           Or what?

                          ALVIN
           Or I'll punch you in the boobs!

                          NEIL
           I don't have boobs. These are
           pectorals!
           Alvin jabs him in the chest.

                          NEIL (CONT'D)
           Ow! My boobs!
           Neil swiftly steps aside.
           Alvin reaches the door to see Norman disappearing along
           the path as fast as he can. Alvin YELLS after him.

                          ALVIN
           You're dead, freakshow! Do you
           hear me? D-E-D! DEAD! You're gonna
           be so dead you're gonna have to
           talk to yourself when you're dead!

           Wearing her fanciest dress, Sandra bustles out of the
           kitchen to the front door.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           I really don't think we should be
           leaving him.

           Perry, you promised me a meal that
           someone else microwaved.

           He's probably up there right now
           fiddling with his ouija, or his
           orbs, or whatever it is he's got
           up there. This is not good.

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, NORMAN'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Norman paces his room looking pale and anxious as he
           hears the front door shut downstairs. Everywhere he turns
           he finds himself face to face with some zombie related
           novelty, from his lurid horror posters to his shelves of
           ghoulish action figures, and it's not doing anything for
           his nerves.
           His cell phone BEEPS from his pocket, giving him a start.
           He takes it out and reads a text; "COME TO THE WINDOW".
           Norman cautiously walks over and peers around the edge of
           the window frame.
           A figure stands motionless in the yard below, sheets of
           laundry billowing off the clothes line beside it. It
           stares up at Norman through the blank eye holes of a
           hockey mask.
           Norman GASPS and jumps back.
           With a frown, he re-emerges and opens the window.
           The figure lifts the mask, and Neil beams out from
           underneath, waving excitedly.

                          NEIL
           You wanna play some hockey?
           Norman SIGHS.

                          NORMAN
           I've kinda got other things on my
           mind right now.
           Neil looks a little uncomfortable.

                          NEIL
           Is it all that walking dead stuff
           again?

                          NORMAN
           Mr Prenderghast appeared to me in
           the bathroom!

                          NEIL

           No, his spirit! He says the
           witch's curse is real and I have
           to go up to the old graveyard to
           stop it! Before the sun sets
           tonight!
           Neil shifts uneasily as he processes.

                          NEIL
           So you wanna come play a bit
           later?

                          NORMAN
           Didn't you hear what I just said?!

                          NEIL
           Yeah, but I thought my idea was
           less likely to get us eaten.
           Norman knows he's on his own in this.

                          NORMAN
           Just go home, Neil. I'm better off
           on my own anyway.

                          NEIL
           But...

                          NORMAN
           Go home!
           Norman reaches up and closes the window. Neil's shoulders
           sag and he turns away.
           Across the room, his Grandma materializes, and squints
           her eyes through the window as Neil awkwardly pulls
           himself over the garden fence.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Jeez, who rattled your chains?

                          NORMAN
           No one.
           Norman isn't in the mood for any more discussion.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Dad says I'm not supposed to talk
           to you any more, Grandma.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Jackass. If I were a poltergeist
           I'd throw something at his head.
           Y'know, by rights I'm supposed to
           be frolicking in paradise with
           your grandfather, but I'm not.

                         42 CONTINUED: (2) 42
           Norman looks up as she drifts closer to the bed.

                          NORMAN
           So why did you stay?

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           I was never one for frolicking.
           I'll bet there's no cable or
           canasta up there either. Besides,
           I promised I'd always look out for
           you.
           She smiles, floating in a sitting position at the end of
           Norman's bed. She bobs gently, like a balloon. For a
           second, this seems to comfort Norman, but then another
           thought crosses his mind.

                          NORMAN
           So it's your... duty?

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           In a manner of speaking...

                          NORMAN
           And you'd do it no matter what?

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Of course.

                          NORMAN
           Even if it was something really
           scary...
           Grandma eyes him curiously.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           There's nothing wrong with being
           scared Norman, so long as you
           don't let it change who you are.
           Norman thinks this over, then smiles up at her again. She
           goes to rub his head affectionately, but her ghost hand
           just passes right through his spiky hair.
           She gives him a wink, and drifts away through the wall.
           He is still scared, but now determined too. He steels
           himself and grabs his jacket from his bed.

           The tiny room is crammed full of posters, pom-poms, plush
           toys and plastic trophies. Pretty much everything is
           pink. Courtney sits talking on her phone, cotton buds
           between her toes as her painted nails dry.

           toss gets twelve thousand hits on
           YouTube!" Yeah, no, I said that.
           (listens and nods)
           Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol.
           Tonight's gonna be a total yawn.
           From downstairs, a door SLAMS. Courtney frowns, puts her
           hand over the phone and shouts out.

                          COURTNEY (CONT'D)

           Beneath a florid evening sky, the Babcock's drive is in
           darkness. Pedalling furiously, Norman rides his bike out
           of the shadows into the light of the street.

           COURTNEY (O.S.)
           You better not be sneaking out you
           little weirdo!

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           On a street corner two teenage girls approach Alvin and
           Pug, who have laid out a breakdancing mat and a beatbox
           and are doing their best to impress. Alvin imagines he is
           wowing the girls with his krumping, his ham-like limbs
           flying around and Pug hollering support, but in truth
           they watch in morbid fascination.
           A faint CLATTERING sound down the road grows louder.
           Norman suddenly THUNDERS past them on his bike, spinning
           Alvin on the spot and knocking him onto his butt.
           Show over, Alvin blunders to his feet, his eyes following
           Norman's trajectory up the dark road, and GROWLS.

                         

          46 EXT. WOODED LANE, MR PRENDERGHAST'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 46

           Tall conifers rise up high on either side of the road,
           now little more than a dirt track. Norman pedals up the
           hill and swerves, skidding to a stop in the gravel.
           He climbs off the bike, eyes fixed on a ramshackle house
           partially hidden in the foliage, its porch door swinging
           and CREAKING eerily in the breeze.
           He cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is
           written "PRENDERGHAST", and steps onto the wooden porch.

           The fading light of day spills across the floorboards and
           faded wallpaper of a long passage.

                          NORMAN
           Hello? Mr Prenderghast?
           Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly
           toward a door, slightly ajar, muttering to himself.
           He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that
           epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghast's mind; a
           mannequin in a shopping cart, a pile of broken
           typewriters, a suspended bag of spoons, a closet full of
           identically soiled hobo suits, a Nordic track...

                         

                         48 48

           INT. PRENDERGHAST'S HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           The study is filled with teetering piles of junk and old
           furniture draped over in dust sheets. A crucifix hangs
           over a metal cot with rumpled bedding. This is evidently
           where the old man lived his whole life. Starlight from a
           window picks out a macabre halo on a shape on the floor:
           Mr Prenderghast, dead where he fell, tightly clutching a
           leather-bound book.
           CLOSE ON Norman's face as he swallows nervously and steps
           closer to the body. He gingerly takes hold of the book
           and gives a gentle tug. It holds fast in the rigor mortis
           grasp. He tugs harder, shaking the book repeatedly, the
           corpse shaking with it.

                          NORMAN
           Let go!
           Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body
           across the floorboards, Mr Prenderghast's head glancing
           off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the
           floorboards, as Norman tries to wrestle the book free.
           With a final yank the book pulls loose and, GASPING,
           Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door.

           Norman careens through the door, leaps off the porch and
           sprints along the wooded lane up the hill, watched by
           Alvin, concealed behind some bushes.

           Norman emerges from the woods, his long shadow preceding
           him as the sun begins its descent behind the tall trees.
           ParaNorman 35.

                         50 CONTINUED: 50
           He pauses and stares out across weathered tombstones
           poking out amidst tangles of thorns.
           Clutching the book tight, Norman wrenches open the heavy
           gate, its rusted padlock crumbling apart.
           Eventually the track runs up to a stone slab surrounded
           on either side by thick bramble. Norman brushes aside
           vines and reads an epitaph engraved into the stone;

           "HERE LIES BURIED THE SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE BLITHE HOLLOW

           CURSE. MAY YOUR SOULS FIND EVENTUAL AND EVERLASTING

           SALVATION. 1712."
           Norman pushes through the thick bushes into a secluded
           plot of land behind the slab with seven gravestones
           sticking out from the undergrowth.

                          NORMAN
           This is it!
           The sun continues its descent, casting an ever
           lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Read from the book, stop the
           curse, go home and pretend this
           never happened.
           Norman steels himself, opens the book and starts to read.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           "Once upon a time, in a far-off
           land there lived a king and queen
           in a magnificent castle..."
           He pauses, confused by what he's reading.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           What? A fairy... tale...?
           A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere, whipping
           the book out of his grasp. He spins around to find Alvin
           standing behind him.

                          ALVIN
           What ya got there, Geekula?
           Norman launches himself at the book, but Alvin holds him
           back at arm's length.

                          NORMAN
           Give it back!

                          ALVIN
           Can't wait to see everybody's
           faces when they hear about this
           one!

           No, don't! Alvin!

                          ALVIN
           Hey! Nobody makes me miss out on a
           possible date with a girl that
           almost had some interest in
           talking to me. Yeah? Thought so!
           You got nothin' to say!

                          NORMAN
           Uh-oh.

                          ALVIN
           Dang straight "uh-oh". That's what
           happens when Alvin gets around
           here. Uh-oh is that Alvin? Uh-oh
           Alvin's gonna make me run home to
           mommy.
           As Norman twists and wrestles against the bully the
           turbulent clouds in the sky above them twist and coalesce
           into the vague semblance of a huge grinning face. The
           face of a witch.
           There is an enormous RUMBLE and a flash of lightning
           silhouettes the boys.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Uh-oh. What is that?
           The wind has picked up, HOWLING through the gravestones.
           Norman looks at the face leering out of the clouds.

                          NORMAN
           It's her!
           Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light, and
           the wind instantly cuts out. The boys stand stock still.
           Reaching down like a colossal arm, a great plume of cloud
           spirals over the cemetery, enveloping the tumbledown
           chapel and seeping around the gravestones. Fingers of
           murky fog slither across the ground, occasionally pausing
           and hanging in the air as though sniffing it. There is
           something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils.
           The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows
           through the graveyard like a shockwave, pulsing through
           the fog like a heartbeat.
           Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog
           suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into
           the earth in front of the boys.

           Silence, then the ground begins to RUMBLE beneath their
           feet and ripples beneath the tombstones. Stone slabs
           GRIND and shift. One CRACKS right through the center.

                          ALVIN
           What's that sound?
           Norman watches, horrified, as the wet earth atop one of
           the graves splits and a skeletal hand bursts through!
           Norman watches as more graves bulge and break open and
           mud-encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth.
           The air is filled with anguished MOANING, the glowing fog
           dancing and whirling about the hatching figures.
           The two boys are rooted to the spot, mouths hanging open.
           CLOSE ON one of the figures crawling out of the ground
           into a patch of moonlight. Ragged and rotten it wears the
           mud-encrusted clothes of a colonial Puritan. It stares
           down at its hands, almost in disbelief, then lifts its
           face up to the sky and lets out a HOWL.
           Thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal LAUGHTER echoes
           through the turbulent clouds.
           The boys find themselves backed up against another
           headstone, this one engraved with the name "JUDGE
           HOPKINS". They leap aside as the ground swells beneath
           their feet, and the DEAD JUDGE punches through the dirt,
           bolt upright. His face wears a rictus grin and he looms
           over the boys like the Grim Reaper in a powdered wig.
           He tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in
           Alvin's hand, and HISSES through yellowed teeth.
           Norman makes a last ditch attempt at reading the book as
           the Dead Judge approaches, the other zombies gathering
           behind him.

                          NORMAN

                          NORMAN
           It's not working!
           The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL, but Norman frowns,
           confused, because he can hear words.

                          DEAD JUDGE

           STOP!... YOU... MUST... STOP!

           Survival instincts finally kick in and Alvin makes a run
           for it, scrambling through the graves toward the gate.

                          NORMAN
           Wait!
           Norman follows, leapfrogging over headstones.

           There's a girl asking for you.
           Neil's face emerges dubiously from a room down the hall.
           Courtney flashes her widest fake grin and puts on a high
           pitched sing-song voice.

           The front door is kicked open and Norman and a near

           door behind them.

                          ALVIN

           He manages to think this through, and frowns.
           Alvin watches curiously as Norman turns his attention to
           the book, frowning as he runs his hand over the embossed
           leather cover.

                          NORMAN
           I don't get it! Why didn't it
           work?
           He opens the book and leafs through page after page of
           ornate calligraphy and woodcut illustrations.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           "The Story of Sleeping Beauty".
           This doesn't make any sense!
           His mind racing, Norman heads off along the hallway.

           The room remains as before, with Mr Prenderghast's corpse
           lying on the floor. Norman enters with purpose and
           approaches it, leaving Alvin horrified in the doorway.
           Norman crouches low over the body, holding the book out
           in front of Mr Prenderghast's blank eyes.

                          NORMAN
           Mr Prenderghast, I don't
           understand! Tell me what to do!

           to stop the curse! I thought it

           Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghast's
           desk, still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings.
           He hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess,
           scattering papers across the floor.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)

           Something CLUNKS loudly from down the hall, sending Alvin
           into a desperate babbling panic.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           We gotta defend ourselves! We
           gotta shoot them in the head with
           like silver stakes or something!
           I'm way too awesome to get eaten!
           Norman, are you listening to me?
           You really have to do something!
           Norman uncovers a couple of faded photographs of the old
           graveyard. One is of the seven tombstones, the other is
           of the stone marker, which reads "HERE LIES BURIED THE

           SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE WITCH'S CURSE..."
           Beside the photos is a torn page from an old book. An
           engraving illustrates the seven members of the witch's
           trial, solemnly seated at a bench within the courthouse.

                          NORMAN
           Seven victims...
           Frowning, Norman glances up and sees a page from an old
           book tacked to the wall. It is an illustration of a
           hideous old crone, cackling evilly.
           Another THUMP from down the hall.
           Norman looks again from the photographs in his hand to
           the image of the old witch. There's something he's not
           seeing... He looks at the pictures in front of him.
           Graves. Jurors. Witch.

           as a mottled hand punches it right through the wood.
           A figure limps slowly into the hallway, dragging one
           crippled foot behind the other. It stops halfway along
           and tilts its head, as if listening, and emits a dire
           MOAN. More shapes appear behind it in the doorway and fan
           out along the hallway.

           The boys tremble in their hiding places trying not to
           make a sound; Alvin crouched behind a stack of books and
           Norman lying underneath the bed. The footsteps grow
           louder as the zombies shuffle into the room.
           NORMAN'S POV - rotten legs step up to Mr Prenderghast's
           body, lying where he fell on the floorboards. Two
           withered feet suddenly step right up to the bed.
           Something drops onto the floor inches in front of
           Norman's face with an unpleasant SLAP. Norman's eyes bug
           out as he realizes it is a zombie's dislodged ear. A
           weltered arm reaches down to grope around for the body
           part, until Norman pushes the ear, as carefully as he can
           manage, back into the zombie's fingers. The hand retreats
           back out from under the bed.
           There is a loud SCREAM as Alvin, unable to contain
           himself any longer, jumps out from his hiding place and
           makes for the door. The corpses look up as he disappears
           down the hall, then stagger after him.
           Norman takes this chance to follow, but the Dead Judge
           blocks his exit. They both stand quite still, staring
           into each others' eyes. The corpse tilts its head, almost
           quizzically, and its eyes widen as it notices the book
           under his arm.
           Norman steps sideways to run past it, but the corpse does
           too. Both it and Norman step one way, then the other, and
           back again. Norman feigns one direction and quickly bolts
           in the other, past the corpse and out the door.

           opening a mouth full of jagged teeth.
           Alvin SCREAMS like a little girl, smacks it ineffectually
           with his spatula, and the door is abruptly SLAMMED in the
           zombie's face, a surprised and muffled GROAN coming from
           the other side.

           The Dead Judge leads the advance of zombies down the hall
           toward them. Norman hears his MOAN.
           Norman swings the door back open, the zombie on the other
           side moving with it, teeth firmly embedded in the wood.
           As it attempts to pry itself free, Norman grabs Alvin by
           the arm and they both dart onto the porch behind its
           back, headed for the road.

           Whoa! Look at that sky!

           The wooded hill rises steeply a few miles in front of
           them, and at its top is the old chapel. Pressing down
           upon it, huge seething thunderclouds shift into
           otherworldly shapes. Mitch and Courtney are mesmerized.
           Neil suddenly points past Mitch's face.

                          NEIL
           Look out!
           Mitch slams on the breaks, twisting the wheel.

                          MITCH
           Oh no!

           I/E. MITCH'S VAN ON WOODED ROAD - CONTINUOUS
           Running down the middle of the road, blinded by the glare
           of the van's headlights, are Alvin and Norman. The van
           swerves around them and grazes the trees, the side mirror
           flying off as it hits a branch.
           Mitch fights to control the van as Courtney SCREAMS.

                          NEIL
           That was Norman!
           Shaken, Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of
           the darkness in front of them. He slams on the brakes
           again, but too late. The tall dirty-looking figure stands
           stock still as the van plows straight into him.
           Dust flies up from the wheels of the van as it skids to
           an eventual stop in the center of the road.

           Mitch turns to everyone as he pulls off his seat belt.

                          MITCH
           Is everyone okay?
           Courtney and Neil answer in unison, both of them upside
           down in their seats with their legs sticking up in the
           air.

                          COURTNEY NEIL
           No!
           No!
           Mitch, trying to stay calm, looks in his rear-view mirror
           and sees a prone shape on the ground some yards back.

          63 EXT. WOODED ROAD - CONTINUOUS 63

           Mitch climbs out of the van and sees the figure lying
           still on the moonlit road. He nervously jogs over to it.
           As he gets closer, Mitch can see the man more clearly. He
           is wrapped in filthy tattered clothing of a bygone era
           and is covered in dirt. Flies BUZZ around him.

                          MITCH
           Er... hello, sir?
           He hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench. A
           mud-encrusted face stares up at him.
           ANGLE ON the van, as Courtney leans her head out.

                          COURTNEY
           Is he dead or what?

                          MITCH
           I... I don't know! He's not
           moving!
           The figure's head lets out a faint GASP.

                          MITCH (CONT'D)
           He's still breathing!
           Mitch reaches out to gently lift the figure's head but as
           he does, there is a CRUNCH and it comes off in his hands.

                          COURTNEY
           So he's okay?

                          MITCH
           Uh... not exactly.

                          COURTNEY
           What? What did you just say?
           Mitch looks from the head back to the van, then at the
           head again. He licks his lips nervously as he thinks.

                          MITCH
           Does anyone know CPR?
           Further down the road, Norman runs back toward the van,
           Alvin still in tow. He sees Mitch ahead of him, getting
           dizzily to his feet, still holding the head.

                          NORMAN
           Run!
           The head in Mitch's hands suddenly GASPS again, opening
           its mouth. Mitch SHRIEKS as the headless figure on the
           road sits up and reaches out its arms. Mitch drop kicks
           it like a football. It flies, WAILING, into the bushes.

           As if struck by the same blow, the rest of the corpse
           staggers backwards.
           Alvin and Norman run past him toward the van, bustling
           past Courtney and clambering inside.
           More corpses are emerging from the trees on either side
           of the road. She SCREAMS and leaps back into the van, as
           Mitch leaps into the driver's seat beside her.

           That was insane!

                          MITCH
           I know, right? I kicked that like
           a hundred yards!

                          COURTNEY
           Norman, what just happened?!

                          ALVIN
           Zombies! I swear, okay? We saw
           them burst out of their graves!
           For real!
           He realizes Mitch and Courtney are staring at him, and
           tries to disguise his raw panic with nonchalance.

           ALVIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                          (TO COURTNEY)
           Just so you know, I totally saved
           his life, and I could totally save
           yours.

           COURTNEY (O.S.)
           Sorry, who are you?

           ALVIN (O.S.)
           I'm Alvin. I'm in his class.
           Norman, not so easily distracted from the problem at hand
           as the others, glances uneasily through the window.
           NORMAN'S POV - The zombies lurch arthritically toward the
           van, GROANING and GURGLING.

           Uh, guys... maybe we should
           actually drive away now.

          65 EXT. WOODED ROAD - CONTINUOUS 65

           CLOSE ON the front wheel, spinning and SQUEALING. The van
           spits out a cloud of exhaust fumes as it accelerates
           away.
           A beat as the smoke clears. The soot-covered zombies
           SPLUTTER as they cough up what's left of their lungs.
           They turn from one to the other, awaiting direction from
           their leader. But the Dead Judge is nowhere to be seen.
           A zombie points down the winding road where the woods
           eventually thin out into leafy suburban drives. The
           ragged shape of the Judge is clinging to the back of the
           van, thrashing around and WAILING as it picks up speed.
           The zombies quietly watch until the van moves out of
           sight behind the trees, then turn their attention to the
           lights of the town center below them. They weigh up their
           options and, MOANING, shuffle toward civilization.

           Further down the hill, Sheriff Hooper is taking a break
           from ticketing borderline traffic violations by drinking
           a giant malt shake in a plastic cup. She leans against
           her parked motorcycle, squinting up at the unnatural
           clouds.

           She finishes her shake and throws the non-recyclable cup
           into the bushes.
           Mitch's van shoots past at high speed in a cloud of dust.

           SHERIFF HOOPER (CONT'D)

           Hooper watches the van tear away, the dark shape of the
           Dead Judge visibly clinging to the back doors, his
           voluminous cape flapping out behind him like a windsock.

           was going to happen tonight!

           You did? Wow, `cos that zombie bit
           really threw me.
           Courtney turns in her seat and glares at her brother.

           completely out of...
           The van's sunroof is suddenly ripped open, and the Dead
           Judge's arm reaches down into the vehicle, clawing inches
           above Courtney's head.

                          COURTNEY (CONT'D)

           ...HAND!
           The Dead Judge leans further into the van, MOANING
           horribly. He seems to have his sights set on Norman, and
           reaches one arm down toward Norman and the book peeking
           out of his shoulder bag.

           Mitch hears a SIREN wail out behind him, and looks in his
           mirror to see the flashing light of Hooper's bike.

           Oh great. The cops.
           Hooper pulls level with the passenger seat window, waving
           angrily.

           Salma talks into her cell phone with an expression of
           withering disdain.

                          SALMA
           So Norman, let me get this
           straight; you guys all go on this

           of the vehicle, planting his face with a SQUELCH against

           He stares down at it, wide-eyed, as it wriggles like an
           animal in his grasp.
           The Dead Judge slides slowly down the windscreen of the

           The arm frees itself from Neil and turns on Norman,
           leaping at him like a viper.
           Norman holds the book up as a shield, and manages to swat
           the zombie arm away, flipping it across the front seat,
           where it lands on the back of Mitch's neck.
           Mitch SCREAMS as the rotten hand clamps down onto the top
           of his head, and madly tries to shake it off. It hangs
           onto him grimly, bony fingers hooked around his nostrils.
           With Mitch no longer steering, the van swerves crazily
           across the road, shaking the Dead Judge off the
           windscreen. He disappears under the front of the vehicle,
           his one remaining arm clinging onto the underside.

                          SALMA
           Well, duh. People found guilty of
           witchcraft weren't considered

           Norman listens intently then shouts over to Mitch, still
           struggling with the zombie hand gripping his face.

           Mitch hangs a sharp right and accelerates off the road

           The six zombies inexorably continue their march, breaking
           cover from outlying woodland into the suburban streets of
           the town proper.
           At the bottom of a long driveway, spotlit by a street
           lamp, Mrs Henscher is taking out the trash in her
           bathrobe.
           She looks up from her garbage as the zombies approach.
           Her face is caked in a terrifying green avocado face
           mask. Barely a few feet in front of her, a similarly
           green face stares back, only this one has been dead for
           three hundred years.
           Henscher SCREAMS, bolting down the street like a runaway
           locomotive.

           Mitch finally manages to pry the Dead Judge's arm off his

           shoulder.
           Alvin lifts his face tentatively over the edge of the
           back seat to see what's going on. The zombie arm plants
           him in the eye, sending both sprawling against the floor.
           Alvin SQUEALS as the arm snakes around his neck into a
           bizarre approximation of a wrestling hold.

           trees behind it, but fails to make the turn and smashes
           through a fence across the other side of the road into a
           suburban back yard, splinters of fence showering down in
           her wake.
           Scattering lawn ornaments, plastic garden toys and deck

           Mitch's van SCREECHES through the intersection, swerving
           in front of the Babcock's station wagon, which veers
           wildly as Perry brakes hard.
           He leaps out of the car as the van drives away.

           Hooper's bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the
           hood of the station wagon with a CRUNCH. Before Perry can
           react he is buried under the mass of Sheriff Hooper,
           dropping like a meteorite onto his head.

           The kids, hanging on for dear life, hear a loud CRUNCH
           from the back of the van.
           They all turn to see the van's rear doors ripped open.
           Silhouetted in the space is the one-armed Dead Judge,
           cape muddied and torn from his crawling back out from the
           vehicle's undercarriage.
           The zombie lunges toward the startled kids, and MOANS.
           Mitch turns his attention back to the road ahead, but too
           late, and he YELLS as green-faced Mrs Henscher runs
           SQUEALING into the van's headlights.
           Mitch throws all his weight onto the wheel, tires
           SCREAMING as the van misses Henscher by inches. The
           violence of the turn flings the Dead Judge backwards like
           a slingshot, disappearing out of the doors and shattering
           into a dozen pieces as he SMASHES into the hard road.

           It bounces down the hill, flipping over and over, the
           kids inside tossed around like rag dolls.
           Somewhat the worse for wear, it eventually comes to a
           stop in a parking lot, neatly crashing into an empty
           space.

           Oh, I broke a nail!
           As Alvin climbs out, he gingerly holds up the Judge's
           arm, as if it were a dead animal, and dangles it limply
           in front of his face.

                          ALVIN
           Yeah! Alvin the zombie slayer! I
           got you...
           The hand suddenly bends back on itself, slaps him on the
           face, and as he SQUEALS it drops to the ground and
           skitters away into the shadows.
           Mitch sizes up what's left of his van, and bids a tearful
           farewell.

           Courtney pouts moodily when she realizes the tender words
           aren't for her.
           Norman looks up at the sky. A thick bank of cloud looms
           over the town, and in its center is the unmistakable
           otherworldly face, ebbing in and out of visibility, and

           The town center retains even less charm when the sun goes
           down, and its remaining denizens are now drunk, high or
           looking for trouble. Provided one requires alcohol, junk
           food or pharmaceuticals, it's the place to be.
           A ruddy-faced drunk, SLOB GUY, inserts a few coins in a
           vending machine at the end of an alley, and waits as the
           metal coil inside curls a candy bar toward the front of
           the machine. The man notices the approaching figures
           further down the back street and frowns.
           He turns back to the machine, waiting. The zombies draw
           closer, GROANING, and the man fidgets uncomfortably.
           The man begins WHIMPERING. The candy bar slowly shifts
           forward. The zombies are close enough to touch.
           The man YELLS and runs away, leaving the candy bar to
           drop to the machine's trough with a CLANG.
           A beat then, still SCREAMING, the man runs back to the
           machine, grabs his candy, then runs away again.
           The Undead emerge onto Main Street, and slow down as they
           take in their surroundings.
           VARIOUS ANGLES ON the garish town center nightlife
           intercut with CLOSE-UPS of the wide-eyed zombies.
           -Two teenage girls in mini-skirts walk along the curb. A
           pickup truck crawls by, driven by red necks who wolf-
           whistle and gesture rudely. The girls GIGGLE.
           -In the nearby "GOBBLER'S" parking lot, a huge woman sits
           in her vehicle cramming a burger into her mouth. As she
           bites down ketchup spatters across the inside of the
           windscreen like arterial spray.
           -A corpse stands agog before a billboard. The poster is
           for a line of "Lady Luck" lingerie and features a buxom
           woman in her underwear draped over a roulette wheel. The
           tagline is "FANCY YOUR CHANCES?" The corpse's one eye
           pops out of its socket and dangles by its optic nerve.

           blare out into the street.

           sitting upon a stolen shopping cart, others kicking a tin
           can from one to the other. One daubs misspelled naughty
           words on the wall beside them. Another is attempting to
           use his bare hands to rip open a parking meter.
           -Another corpse stands in the light of a store window, a
           bank of TVs showing all kinds of programs. Racing car
           explosions; scantily-clad singers gyrating in music
           videos; talking animals and Viagra commercials.
           QUICK CUTS OF ZOMBIE CLOSE-UPS as they all raise rotten

           Slob Guy suddenly bursts out of the door of the Bar

           other shoe to drop.

           What should we do?
           Barely skipping a beat, the townsfolk shift seamlessly
           from shock and awe to bullish aggression.
           Crystal pulls a pump-action shotgun from somewhere about

           Norman leads the way, but stops dead as they run headlong
           into a scene of zombie invasion mayhem.
           Townsfolk fill the streets, SHOUTING and acting generally
           mob-like. One or two of them have even got hold of
           burning torches from somewhere. It's apocalyptic chaos.
           The fat woman from the Drive-Thru runs past SCREAMING,
           her face and T-shirt covered in blood-red ketchup.

           C'mon!
           They skirt around the edge of Main Street, avoiding
           flying bottles and limbs as best they can.
           Following the noise, the Judge staggers along some way
           behind. He surveys the scene as he emerges, his
           featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of
           expressing horrified shock.
           After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the
           kids in the distance. A look of resolve crosses his face,
           turning quickly to surprise as a SHOT rings out nearby.
           The Judge looks down to a large hole blown through his
           midriff. Framed within it is Crystal, several feet away,
           rifle smoking. He looks up again, weighs up his chances,
           then lets out a ROAR of retreat to his beleaguered
           companions before running off into the shadows.
           Those zombies who haven't already tried to run for cover
           manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow
           the Judge's CRY, some of them breaking into a sprint.

           It is an old timber building, surrounded by graceless
           modern office blocks around the cobbled square.
           The kids race across the plaza, pausing to catch their
           breath at the ugly witch statue in front of the Town
           Hall. They GASP as they slow their pace.

           yanks it out of the ground, hefts it through the window,
           then reaches through to unfasten the door latch.

           The lobby is dark, but moonlight glistens off polished
           wood through a lofty circular window.
           Norman shouts out from the other side of the lobby, where
           he stands beside a door labelled "HALL OF RECORDS"..

           inside.

           The door swings open and reveals a labyrinth of shelves
           and glass cabinets stretching out into the shadows in
           front of him. Row after row of dusty cardboard file boxes
           and ledgers stacked one on top of another.
           Norman stops in his tracks, color draining from his face.

                          NORMAN
           Uh-oh.
           Courtney follows, faking enthusiasm.

           Great! I'm super psyched! This is
           turning into the most fun night
           ever!
           The overhead light clicks on as Alvin steps into the room
           behind her and GROANS.

           across the street!
           Neil is more optimistic, and brightly makes his way over
           to a shelf, and pulls down a slim ledger.

           This'll be a piece of cake, you'll
           see.

           Mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf. He

           then ignores them and begins curling it like a dumbbell.

           face panicked. It would take days to go through them all.

           Sheriff Hooper looks around and sees an awful lot of

           trouble on her hands.

           Perry drives into town in silence, his nose bloodied and
           stuffed with tissues. Sandra sits beside him and Sheriff
           Hooper is in the back seat, scouring the streets.

           Would've been a quiet night too,

           As Perry and Sandra exchange uneasy glances, Hooper
           suddenly points through the windshield to the riot in

           Perry brakes hard just a few feet in front of the

           the fleeing Undead. Hooper bustles out of the car, making
           a beeline for Deputy Dwayne.
           Crystal turns and fires into the street, taking out a
           lightbulb over a store sign. A dog somewhere in the
           shadows YELPS and runs away.

           What do you think you're doing,

           EXT. TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           In the alley down the side of the old Town Hall, the
           zombies tiptoe through the shadows. They look slightly
           the worse for wear; some have lost limbs, others have
           large holes in them. One has a toilet plunger stuck on
           her head.
           The Dead Judge looks up at the sky. The turgid
           supernatural storm RUMBLES closer, pressing down upon the
           nearby rooftops.
           The Judge motions to the other zombies to hurry, and
           grabs hold of the Town Hall's side door. He rips it open,
           and furtively motions the zombies to file inside.

           The townsfolk around her refuse to be allayed by this.
           Perry and Sandra have emerged dubiously out of their car
           and watch from the periphery, utterly bewildered.
           Mrs Henscher, newly arrived and wearing her avocado face
           mask like war paint, shakes her shotgun and points down

           The information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire.
           Several faces turn to Henscher, who is pleased to have an
           engaged audience and hams it up shamelessly, coming on
           like Braveheart in curlers.

           Despite Hooper's protests, the townsfolk are on lynch mob
           auto pilot and surge like a force of nature along the
           Main Street toward the Town Hall plaza.

           Dozens of books and cardboard boxes lie scattered across

           ransacked as the kids drag documents off shelves and
           rummage through binders.
           Norman sits on the floor flipping through sheet after
           sheet of records. Courtney wades through documents toward
           him, holding up a fist full of old rolled-up papers.

           The kids manage to pull back just as a burning bottle
           flies over their heads, SHATTERING glass. It lands in the
           middle of the room and a puddle of burning alcohol
           spreads across the floorboards.
           Tendrils of black smoke are also beginning to creep under
           the edge of the front door.
           The kids stand in a group, terror-stricken as the smoke
           thickens and flames begin to lick along the floor.

           Norman heaves himself through a tiny hatchway onto a flat
           roof at the highest point of the building. He shuts the
           hatch, inching away as the zombies beneath beat on it
           with their hands.
           Norman finds himself backed up against a flimsy wooden
           rail, which CREAKS warningly. He leans over and sees the
           square beneath, filled with angry people. He has nowhere
           left to run.
           Above him the red sky RUMBLES, clouds churning into a
           ghastly grinning mouth.

           Far below, the gathered townsfolk grow increasingly
           erratic. A pair of visiting tourists happily take in
           their surroundings with their cell phones and cameras.
           Sandra tugs at her husband's arm as they are buffeted by
           the increasingly erratic townsfolk.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh my gosh, do you think this has

           tiny figure silhouetted against the raging sky on the
           roof of the building.

           Norman continues YELLING at the sky, waving the book.
           He madly flicks through the pages, attempting to read
           aloud over the ROARING wind.

                          NORMAN
           Once upon a time in a far-off land
           there lived a king and queen... in

           The horrible cloud face above him CACKLES monstrously,
           drowning out the story.

           Why won't you listen to me? Why
           are you doing this?!
           The face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of
           lightning spits out. It SMACKS into the book held in
           front of Norman's chest, lifts him up off his feet and
           throws him back onto the old timbers of the roof.
           The air is knocked out of Norman as, trailing smoke, he
           SMASHES through the wood into the fiery chasm of the
           building beneath.

           INT. TOWN HALL, OLD COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Norman lies on the floor, shifting painfully. With some
           effort he sits up, rubbing his head.
           The book in his hand is now a blackened cinder with a
           large smoldering hole gouged through the middle.
           Norman realizes he is no longer inside the burning
           building. Around him indistinct shapes begin to pool into
           clarity. He is in the courthouse, but three hundred years
           ago, and a trial is about to begin.
           A crowd of onlookers gather around a platform at the head
           of the room where officious-looking gentlemen in austere
           Puritan clothing stand around a table. Two dour men in
           black skull caps are seated, an empty chair between them.
           Norman moves unnoticed through the crowd toward the
           platform. The hubbub of the townsfolk dies down.
           The imposing figure of Judge Hopkins, tall and august,
           marches out of a side chamber, steps up onto the wooden
           dais and seats himself silently between his solemn peers.
           He glares down at Norman with cold, humorless eyes.

                          JUDGE HOPKINS
           Agatha Prenderghast of his
           Majesty's Province of
           Massachusetts...
           As the Judge's voice continues, Norman sees played out
           against it a MONTAGE of the preceding court case.
           The notary stands up, waving a wad of testimonies.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ...on this day you have been
           arraigned for the horrible crime
           of witchcraft...
           A pale woman fiddles nervously with the ribbon on her
           bonnet as she is questioned by the Judge.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ...witnessed by those whose
           testimonies have been heard.
           A wiry woman with a pinched face gestures fearfully with
           her arms as she recounts her evidence.

           No!
           A young farmhand bows his head shamefully, as he adds
           further ammunition to the prosecution.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.)
           ...and it is passed on you,
           according to your grievous
           crimes...

           tells her story.
           QUICK CUTS of the accusers, one after the other, as the
           Judge finishes his verdict. The notary, the preacher, the
           townsfolk. All point at Norman.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)
           ...execution.
           Camera swings slowly around Norman to reveal AGGIE
           PRENDERGHAST, standing in chains right behind him.

                          AGGIE
           No!
           Norman reacts with horror. The "witch" cowering next to
           him is no more than eleven years-old. Her long hair is
           unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from
           her eyes. Her manacles have been specially made to fit
           her tiny wrists, and weigh her to the floor. She SNIFFS,
           scared and confused.

                          JUDGE HOPKINS
           Do you have anything to say for
           yourself?

                          AGGIE

           Aye, with fire! You were speaking
           with the dead!
           The crowd GASPS and MURMURS fearfully.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)

                          NORMAN
           Wait! No! You can't do this!
           The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie. She
           backs away, tears flowing down her face.

                          AGGIE
           I didn't do anything wrong!
           A terrible panic comes over her face.

           Stop! Leave me alone or I'll make
           you sorry! I'll make all of you
           sorry!
           Norman feels unsteady on his feet, the room seeming to
           spin around him. The faces of the townsfolk, pale and
           skull-like, swirl around and around, blurring together.
           In the center of it all, glowing like a bonfire, Aggie

           SCREAMS.
           The world turns black and Norman collapses in a faint.

           shuffling back across the floorboards on his bottom. The
           dead villagers stand where they are, staring intently.

           You can speak to the dead. To us.
           To her. We need you to read from

           But it didn't work! It's a fairy
           tale! Just a bedtime... story...
           He narrows his eyes at the Judge.

           That's it, isn't it? A bedtime
           story to keep a little girl asleep
           for another year. And now you need
           my help because I'm the only one
           who can read it to her!
           He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at
           the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the Judge. It
           hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a THUD.

           Smeared with soot and COUGHING, the kids are trapped in

           filled with flakes of charcoal and burning ash.
           A burning timber GROANS as it splits from the ceiling and
           tumbles toward the children. They SCREAM and scatter as

                          COURTNEY
           You've gotta be kidding me...
           Norman, his mouth shielded by his sleeve, heads
           purposefully toward the front doors.

           EXT. TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           A loud THUD from within the Town Hall causes the gathered
           crowd outside to GASP, and those closest to the doors to
           take a few steps back.
           The crowd GASPS again as the charred front door of the
           Town Hall is wrenched off its hinges by a huge piece of
           timber and CRASHES down the steps in a shower of flaming
           splinters.
           A ripple of shock runs through the crowd as a number of
           skeletal figures emerge, SPLUTTERING and WHEEZING through
           the smoke, shielding their faces from the heat.
           The gathered crowd are even more aghast when they realize
           a child is being guided out of the flames by the zombies.
           Unseen by the crowd, Courtney and the other kids crawl to
           the splintered opening of the front door, blinking and
           COUGHING for air.
           Hooper pulls out her gun and marches toward the zombies.

                          SHERIFF HOOPER
           You stay right where you are! You
           may be dead already, but I will
           still shoot you!

                         131 CONTINUED: 131
           The zombies stop on the steps, burning building behind
           them and the hostile townsfolk in front of them. Norman
           pushes through and stands firmly in the way of Hooper's
           gun, arms spread defensively.

                          NORMAN
           Wait!
           Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from
           within the doorway.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh my gosh!
           Far above, the clouds THUNDER like demonic laughter.
           Perry steps forward, face red.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Son! Step away from the zombies!

                          NORMAN
           No! I won't!
           Sandra comes up behind her husband and holds his arm.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Perry, calm down! You're going to
           have a heart attack and then what
           are you going to do?

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           I'll come back and haunt Norman!
           Maybe then he'll start listening
           to me!

                          NORMAN
           No! You don't understand what's
           happening here! I spoke to them
           and it's not what you think!
           Courtney edges forward out of the doorway, shocked but
           transfixed.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           The curse isn't about the zombies
           hurting you! It's about you
           hurting them! I figured it out,
           and I know a way to stop this!

                          MRS HENSCHER
           He's in league with them!
           A few members of the crowd try to push past Perry toward
           the steps.

                          DEPUTY DWAYNE
           Let's hang him!

                          DEPUTY DWAYNE
           Then let's burn him!
           Sandra turns despairingly to the crowd behind her.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Can you stop being a mob for just
           one minute?!

                          NORMAN
           Listen to me!

                          CRYSTAL
           Get them before they eat us!
           Punctuating every shout, the roiling clouds continue to
           RUMBLE their horrible laughter.

                          COURTNEY
           Leave him alone!
           Courtney suddenly emerges, standing right in front of
           Norman. Following her lead in true "I'm Spartacus!"
           fashion, Neil, Mitch and Alvin step forward too, creating
           a barrier all around him, all joining hands in
           solidarity.
           CLOSE ON Courtney's face as she hisses sidelong to Alvin.

                          COURTNEY (CONT'D)
           Hand, Alvin! My hand!
           A ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd.

                          COURTNEY (CONT'D)
           Everybody, listen up! You all need
           to stop trying to kill my brother!
           You're adults! Stop it! I know
           that this seems crazy, believe me
           I'm with you on that, but I think
           he does actually know what he's
           talking about!

                          NEIL
           All night he's been trying to save
           you from the witch's curse!

                          MITCH
           Yeah, and all you want to do is
           burn and murder stuff, burn and
           murder stuff! Just burning and
           murdering!

           Shame on every single one of you!
           How dare you all!
           Amongst the crowd, doubt is beginning to show. Even the
           rumbling clouds have gone quiet.

                          CRYSTAL
           So they're not going to hurt us?

                          NORMAN
           No, does it look like any of them
           are trying to hurt you? They're
           just people. At least they used to
           be. Just stupid people who should
           have known better.
           Norman looks at the line of Puritans. They look quite sad
           and pathetic really. Hardly monstrous at all.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           They did something unforgivable
           because they were scared, and they
           were cursed for it. Now it's
           happening all over again. Don't
           you get it? They were just like
           you. But now it has to stop. For
           good.
           Across the crowd, weapons are being lowered and faces are
           starting to look a little guilty.
           There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the
           line of three hundred year-old townsfolk. Throughout the
           crowd various weapons CLATTER as they hit the ground.
           A small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one
           of the zombies his arm back.
           The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM. It blows
           out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza on a
           hellish wind. The street lamps around the square shatter
           in bursts of sparks, raining down on the amassed people.
           The sky above is blood red, clouds twisting and
           contorting into a vast unnatural vortex.
           The Town Hall erupts in a fireball, tongues of white fire
           ROARING out of the embers as the ground shakes and the
           crowd scatters in terror.
           Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a
           parked car, and SHOUTS over the noise of the wind.

                          NEIL
           Jeez, what is her problem?
           Norman takes in the chaos around them...

           -An arc of white lightning hits the base of the witch's
           statue with a CRACK. With a terrible GROAN, the statue is
           lifted up into the air by the supernatural wind. It
           CRASHES down at the foot of the Town Hall steps,
           shattering into a hundred pieces of rubble.
           -Windows blow out of tacky tourist stores, their cheap
           front displays ripped apart by the wind.
           -A bolt of lightning tears through the huge billboard in
           the plaza, ripping apart the idealized image of the
           town's history in a spiral of splintered wood.
           Norman struggles over to where a group of townsfolk and
           zombies cower from the destruction. Sandra runs over to
           her son and hugs him.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh, Norman!

                          NEIL

                          NORMAN
           I... I really don't know...

                          COURTNEY
           Yes you do, Norman! You've got to
           get to that witch's grave!

           But...

                          COURTNEY
           But nothing! You listen to me,
           buster, we didn't turn away when
           Daleridge High was slaughtering
           our volleyball team, did we?

                          NORMAN
           I thought we did.

                          COURTNEY
           No we didn't. I've cheered the
           uncheerable, Norman, and I'm not
           letting you give up now!
           Norman turns to Perry, his eyes all business.

                          NORMAN
           Dad, could I borrow the car?

           The Dead Judge sits rigidly between Norman and Courtney
           in the back of Perry's station wagon, Perry and Sandra in
           the front.
           Perry drives in silent discomfort following the Judge's
           instructions through town, glancing in his rear-view
           mirror at the passengers in the back seat.
           Sandra takes a small perfume spritzer from her purse as
           surreptitiously as she can and sprays the air around her.

           the middle of the street, tearing up the asphalt.

           Perry swerves out of its path of destruction.
           Inside, Sandra cranes her neck around to watch the truck
           CRASH down the road behind them. She faces front again.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK

           He says "take a left here".
           Perry gives a distasteful look, but turns the steering
           wheel. He peers out through the raging storm, windscreen
           wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris.

           The headlights of the car illuminate a huge fallen trunk
           ahead along the path, and Perry pulls the car to a stop,
           wheels CRUNCHING on dirt and roots.
           Everyone gets out of the car. The trees around them are
           thick and dense. Aggie's furious storm WHISTLES through
           the branches far above them.
           Norman turns to the Dead Judge. The Judge nods solemnly,
           pointing ahead.
           Norman steels himself and begins to march forward through
           the thick brambles, the others following behind.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           So, why are we here?

                          NORMAN

           Yeah, um, why's that person you,
           exactly?
           As they continue, the surrounding trees press in on them,
           just like in Norman's vision. Branches and thorns lash at
           their faces while thick roots entangle their feet.
           Norman's family are falling behind and realize too late
           that the encroaching trees are about to crush Norman.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh my goodness, look out!

           Perry! Do something!
           Perry is finding it difficult to move; a tree bears down
           on him, its roots snagging his thrashing limbs.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           I'm trying!

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Kick it in the knothole!
           Norman hops nimbly between two huge trunks as they SMASH
           together, blocking off the way ahead with gnarled wood.
           Sandra struggles free and shouts over the branches.

           Be careful!
           Now separated from the others, Norman turns to go ahead
           on his own. Ahead of him a phosphorescent glow shines off
           the trees, and he knows he is very close.

           EXT. OLD FOREST CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           Exhausted but determined, Norman finds the source of the
           supernatural storm; a clearing sculpted out of the forest
           by Aggie's fury.
           In the center of it all is the tree, bleached white as
           bone and grotesquely twisted. The trees around it CREAK
           and GROAN as though they'd like to uproot and plant
           themselves someplace else.
           Beneath this tree lie Aggie's remains, buried three
           hundred years ago. Now a mess of roots and rocks open out
           like an ugly wound, and within them a tiny childlike
           figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of
           spectral energy. Ectoplasm rages up around the tree's
           finger-like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative
           energy. It's a child's tantrum turned atomic.

                          NORMAN
           Hello?
           Words echo around him in response.

                          AGGIE
           You're not welcome here. Go away.
           Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly.
           The raging wind intensifies as Norman turns back around.

                          NORMAN
           Uh... I really need to speak with
           you.

                          AGGIE
           Who are you?

                          NORMAN
           I'm Norman. Norman Babcock. You
           don't actually know me, but I know
           you. We're actually kind of the
           same, you and I.
           Norman takes another step closer, ducking as petrified
           branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind.

           You're not dead.

                          NORMAN
           Well, no, apart from that.

                          AGGIE
           And you're a boy.

                          NORMAN
           Well, yes, that too.

                          AGGIE
           You're not like me at all.
           Norman hesitates, knowing he's on dangerous ground.

                          NORMAN
           Well, I know how you feel?

                          AGGIE
           No you don't. You don't know
           anything about me.

                          NORMAN
           I know your name is Agatha
           Prenderghast.
           The ghostly voice wavers for the first time.

                          AGGIE
           What?

                          NORMAN
           And I know you're probably tired.
           Right? Because, I mean, it's
           really late and it's been a long
           night and we're, like, only eleven
           years-old, and...
           The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder.

                          AGGIE
           I don't want to go to sleep, and
           you can't make me! I burnt the
           book into dust, and now I don't
           have to listen to that stupid
           story any more! Leave me alone!
           Norman is terrified, but advances on the tree, the rocks
           under his feet churning.

                          NORMAN
           No. I'm not leaving. Just listen
           to me.
           (takes a breath)
           Uh... once upon a time... long
           ago... there was a little girl...

           What?

                          NORMAN
           A little girl who was different
           from the other people in her
           village.
           The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its
           demonic fingers in its ears.

                          AGGIE
           I'm not listening! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-

           LAAA!

                          NORMAN
           She could see and do things that
           no one could understand, and that
           made them scared of her.

                          AGGIE
           I don't like this story!

                          NORMAN
           She turned away from everyone, and
           became sad and lonely, and had no
           one to turn to.

                          AGGIE
           Stop it!
           If Aggie weren't floating three feet above the ground,
           she'd be stamping her feet. Her voice blows bits of bark
           off the surrounding trees.

                          NORMAN
           But the more she turned away from
           people, the more scared they were
           of her, and they did something
           terrible!
           Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air. Where they
           hit the ground, they send up white flames.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           They became so scared that they
           took her away and killed her!

                          AGGIE
           No!

                          NORMAN
           But even though she was dead
           something in her came back.

           years...

                          NORMAN
           And the longer it stayed, the less
           there was of the little girl!

                          AGGIE
           I'll make you suffer!

                          NORMAN
           Why?
           Aggie goes to shout, but stops, unsure of her answer.

                          AGGIE
           Because... because...

                          NORMAN
           Because you want everyone to hurt
           just as much as you are! So
           whenever you wake up you play this
           mean game, but you don't play
           fair!

                          AGGIE
           They hurt me!

                          NORMAN
           So you hurt them back?

                          AGGIE
           I wanted everyone to see how
           rotten they were!

                          NORMAN
           You're just like them, Agatha.

                          AGGIE
           No I'm not!

                          NORMAN
           You're a bully.

                          AGGIE
           No I'm not!
           Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm. The world
           behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos.

                          NORMAN
           They did something awful, but that
           doesn't mean you should too!

           All that's left of you now is mean
           and horrible!
           He sees her clearly now. True, she is floating above the
           ground, and her hair is writhing madly about her, and
           plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body, but
           she's still just a little girl underneath.

                          AGGIE
           That's not true!
           Norman climbs up a tree root, Aggie's flames searing his
           skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her.

                          NORMAN
           Then stop. This is wrong and you
           know it! You've spent so long
           remembering the bad people that
           you've forgotten the good ones.
           There must have been someone who
           loved you and cared for you. You
           don't remember them?

           Keep away from me!
           Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps. His
           outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach Aggie's
           tiny hand, as though the air is fighting against him.

                          NORMAN
           Remember!
           There is a flash of white, and silence.

           EXT. NEW FOREST CLEARING - BRIGHT SUNNY DAY

           Dappled sunlight falls through shimmering leaves and
           blossoms. Norman and Aggie are standing in thick grass,
           replete with wild flowers, the dead white tree now quite
           alive and blossoming behind them.
           Aggie is no longer an indistinct specter, but flesh and
           blood and as real as Norman. She stares down at her hand
           as Norman holds it gently by the end of her finger.

                          AGGIE
           Aggie. My name was Aggie.

           A brightly-colored butterfly flutters between them. Aggie
           starts to remember as she follows its flight.

                          AGGIE (CONT'D)
           I... I remember my mommy brought
           me here once. We sat under the
           tree and she told me stories. They
           all had happy endings.

                          (BROW FURROWS)
           And then those horrible men came
           and took me away and I never saw
           her again!
           She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her
           face. It instantly crumples up into ashes. Surprised, she
           GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground.
           There's anger in Aggie, but there is confusion, sadness
           and regret there too. She isn't quite so scary anymore.

                          NORMAN
           Sometimes when people get scared
           they say and do terrible things. I
           think you got so scared, that you
           forgot who you are. But I don't
           think you're a witch. Not really.
           Aggie looks into his eyes.

                          AGGIE
           You don't?

                          NORMAN
           I think you're just a little kid
           with a really special gift who
           only ever wanted people to
           understand her.
           He smiles softly.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           So we're not all that different at
           all.

                          AGGIE
           But what about the people who hurt
           you? Don't you ever want to make
           them suffer?
           Norman thinks this over, and shrugs.

                          NORMAN
           Well, yeah, but what good would
           that do? You think just because
           there's bad people out there that
           there's no good ones either? I
           thought the same thing.

           does it end?

           I think that's up to you.
           Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet.

                          AGGIE
           Is this where they buried me?

                          NORMAN
           It's a pretty good place to sleep.
           Then you can be with your mom
           again.
           Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground,
           her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on
           the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands.
           Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes.
           Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny
           frame shifting softly under her long hair.
           The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie
           softens as though out of focus, and the whole world
           becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes
           his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up
           into the clouds high above his head.
           Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES
           softly through the sky, as if moving away.

           The zombies form a group in the center of the square, all
           of them looking up into the clouds. The people around
           them stop and stare, awestruck as a breeze buffets their
           clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer.
           As the modern townsfolk watch on, some of the zombies
           take each others' arms for support. Those with eyelids
           close them. One by one their bodies dissolve away,
           leaving ethereal figures in their place.

           For a moment they float where they stood, ghostly

           descendents, and in an instant become just specks of

           sight.

           Norman blinks open his eyes, taking a moment to survey

           He sits upon the upturned root of the tree, the earth
           around broken and twisted, a testament to what has
           happened. He looks up into the sky and gives a sad smile.

           lighter and less menacing.
           In the Town Square, clusters of townsfolk are trying to
           come to terms with the night's events.
           Norman weaves through the crowd away from the Babcock's
           station wagon, searching for Neil. He hears small
           snippets of conversation as he goes.
           Dwayne waves his notebook under Hooper's nose.

                          DEPUTY DWAYNE
           So, uh, are we gonna need
           statements?
           She slaps it out of his hand.

           DEPUTY DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           Ow! That was my finger nail.
           Slob Guy, Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each
           other of their excuses.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           You know what it's like. You join
           a mob and you say things. I was
           merely inhabiting the role.

                          SLOB GUY
           Yeah, it was the others. They
           pushed me into it.
           Norman smiles as he passes Alvin, regaling a bunch of
           teenagers.

                          ALVIN
           Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot
           of the same classes. Pretty much
           inseparable. Best buds. And we do
           a lot of psychic investigations
           together. We have a blog actually,
           you should check it out.
           Nearby, Courtney wastes no time cozying up to Mitch.

                          COURTNEY
           So I was thinking, maybe we could
           catch a movie sometime? Nothing
           scary.

                          MITCH
           That sounds great, Kathy! Y'know,
           you're gonna love my boyfriend!
           He's like a total chick-flick nut!
           Courtney stares at him, at a loss for words, then
           successfully reads between the lines and turns away

           MUTTERING.
           Norman eventually finds Neil sat upon the witch statue's
           broken plinth, attempting to piece it back together
           pebble by pebble.

                          NORMAN
           Hey Neil.
           He climbs up beside his friend, who beams at him
           gleefully.

                          NEIL
           You did it! You stopped the
           witch's curse and made the zombies
           go away and saved pretty much
           everything!

                          NORMAN
           I guess. I just wanted to say
           thanks. You stood by me. All the
           time.

                          NEIL
           Yeah, of course. Don't get weird
           or anything. So you think now
           everything's gonna turn back to
           normal?
           Norman looks across the square. The smoldering buildings,
           the fallen signposts, the warped trees, the rubble...

                          NORMAN
           As normal as it could be.

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Norman sits on the floor in front of the TV. A news
           report shows the wrecked Main Street with the headline

           "TOURIST TOWN HIT BY MYSTERY TORNADO".
           Perry enters the room, and Norman quickly changes the
           channel on the TV to a noisy monster movie.

           What're you watching?

                          NORMAN
           A scary movie.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Your, uh, your grandma here is
           she?
           Norman looks around and sees his father and grandmother
           sitting side by side on the sofa. He nods.

           PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)
           Right. Of course she is.
           Perry tries his best to maintain his composure, and
           wriggles a little in his seat.

           PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)
           Is she... Is she sitting next to
           me?
           Norman nods. Perry "hem-hems" and turns awkwardly to face
           her, nose to ear. She doesn't seem to notice.

           PERRY BABCOCK (CONT'D)
           Hi Mom.
           Perry tries to downplay his discomfort and turns back to
           concentrate on the movie his son is watching.
           Sandra and Courtney enter from the kitchen carrying
           snacks. Sandra takes a seat on an armchair and Courtney
           lies down on the floor beside her brother, munching
           popcorn. They all settle in to watch the movie.
           A beat, then Perry and Grandma speak at the same time.

           So what's happening now? So what's happening now?
           Norman sits as he is, facing the TV, and grins.

          The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
          dog and a young girl emerge.

                         GIRL
          Go on now Paul, don't be long.

          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.

                         GIRL
          Paul... Paul?
          The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.

                         GIRL
          Paul?!
          The glow fades again.

          EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY

          GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
          blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
          hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
          Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
          way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
          brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
          the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
          the blade. He nods appreciatively.

                         CLIVE
          Beautiful piece.

                         VENDER
          Damn straight. Practical
          performance. 100% Japanese, folded
          steel. Real hero shit.

                         CLIVE
          How much?

                         VENDER

          $1,349.99.
          CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.

                         GRAHAM
          Aren't you gonna get it?

                         CLIVE
          No, it's rubbish.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

          We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,
          passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a
          line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.

                         GRAHAM
          What are you going to ask?

                         CLIVE
          Do you feel that the killing of
          Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,
          invalidates Ripley's struggle at
          the closed of the previous
          installment?

                         GRAHAM
          I was going to ask that!

                         CLIVE

                         (IN KLINGON)
          Tough tits four eyes.

                         SECURITY
          Alright, next!
          Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
          pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Hey there. Who's it to?

                         GRAHAM
          Graham.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Uh... are you... did you?

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          There you go.
          SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Hey there. Who's it to?

                         CLIVE
          Clive.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Clive.

                         CLIVE
          Uh... are you... did you?

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          There you go.
          SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.

                         CLIVE
          I... I need to photograph him.

                         SECURITY
          You can take it from there.
          CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
          themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes
          the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with
          MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move
          off, looking at their spoils.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE

                         (HIGH FIVING)

          YES!

                         GRAHAM
          That was amazing. I was actually a
          bit nervous.

                         CLIVE
          Really? I wasn't.

                         GRAHAM
          Good egg, wasn't he?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I
          forgot to give him my card.
          CLIVE points at SECURITY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         GRAHAM
          Give it to Colossus.

                         CLIVE
          Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!

                         GRAHAM
          She NEEDS to call me.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.
          On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -
          ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying
          the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
          rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
          whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and
          down, making sure everything is in order.

                         PUBLICIST
          Looks good, right?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, it's very impressive.

                         PUBLICIST
          It really does the image justice. I
          never noticed the third tit.

                         CLIVE
          That was Graham's idea.

                         PUBLICIST
          Ladies man, huh? You guys happy?
          You got enough pens? You wanna
          Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?

                         CLIVE
          I'll have a fat Coke please?

                         PUBLICIST
          A fat what?

                         CLIVE
          Coke.

                         PUBLICIST
          Oh you man a FAT Coke.

                         CLIVE

          Fat coke.

          Yes please.

          Ten minutes ago.

                         CLIVE
          Why is it so quiet?

          Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main
          pavillion.

                         CLIVE
          Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I
          wanted to find out if he actually
          eats the brains.

                         PUBLICIST
          I can make a call.

          It'll pick up when he's done.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm nervous.

                         CLIVE
          Don't be. The hard work's done, we
          have a great story and as usual
          your renderings jump from the page.

          Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.

          Thank you.

                         CLIVE
          All we have to do now is sit back
          and enjoy.
          A child approaches.

          Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you
          should have given her four.

          That's sick.

                         PUBLICIST
          Better than Carl Weathers.

                         CLIVE

          YES!

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a copy?

                         PUBLICIST
          Are you nuts? My office is full of
          junk.
          The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.

                         CLIVE
          Graham, I need a drink.

          INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM
          drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE
          sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar
          is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff
          from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console
          plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at
          a map. Other maps are scattered about.

          CLIVE (O.S.)
          It was like the Prancing Pony in
          there.

                         GRAHAM
          Nasty Hobbitses.
          CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
          towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly
          incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs
          on a black leather cord.

                         CLIVE
          They think they're so cool.

                         GRAHAM
          Hey, are you excited about going to
          Area 51?

                         CLIVE
          Hell yes.

                         GRAHAM
          06.30 check out?

                         CLIVE
          A-ffirmative.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.

                         CLIVE
          Three, two, one...

                         GRAHAM CLIVE
          Beep. Beep.

                         CLIVE
          Good night, Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Good night, Clive.
          They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
          plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you asleep?

                         CLIVE
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         GRAHAM
          Shall we try and storm the Citadel
          before we nod off?

                         CLIVE
          Couldn't hurt could it?
          We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
          The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.

                         CLIVE
          Cover me.

          INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely
          sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the
          reception desk. His head hits the bell.

          DING!

          EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

          The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
          across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
          valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.

                         VALET
          There you go.

                         GRAHAM
          That's not ours.

                         VALET
          No?

                         CLIVE
          No, that's ours.
          A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
          the range in its day. Still looks good.

                         VALET
          Oh.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
          the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
          the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.

                         VALET
          Fucking Borg.
          (giving the finger)
          Assimilate this!
          The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          can be heard whooping within.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          INT. RV - MORNING

          CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
          black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
          fusses with maps and provisions.

                         GRAHAM
          Breakfast?

                         CLIVE
          Java. Straight up.

                         GRAHAM
          Any solids?

                         CLIVE
          No, let's punch through. Miles make
          the eggs taste sweeter.

                         GRAHAM
          I love eggs!

                         CLIVE
          I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on
          the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
          I need your map skills.

                         GRAHAM
          Good job I pre-pared.
          GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
          (Chewie) seat.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a shame I don't have some
          controls on this side. That way, I
          could take over if you needed the
          loo.

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, I could say "take the helm."

                         GRAHAM
          "Take the helm, number one."

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I
          need a number two."
          They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
          his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.

                         GRAHAM
          "Least I've got Cerebro, eh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         CLIVE
          Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi
          map and advanced geo-tagging with
          continual info stream?

                         GRAHAM
          Impressive.

                         CLIVE
          Most impressive.

                         GRAHAM
          And let's not forget, we've always
          got Analogue.
          GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.

                         CLIVE
          Not when we're driving Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.
          GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
          percolator gurgles in the galley.

                         GRAHAM
          Sounds like coffee o'clock.

                         CLIVE
          Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've
          had my first cup of J.
          GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
          prawns. He inspects the shells.

                         GRAHAM
          Looks like a pile of dead droids.
          A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
          awkward.

                         WAITRESS
          You boys all set? Can I get you
          anything else?
          GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.

          INT/EXT. RV - DAY

          They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         CLIVE
          Amazing, isn't it? There are
          295,734,134 people in this country
          and we haven't seen a soul for a
          hundred miles. Where is everybody?

                         GRAHAM
          What about that old woman on
          crutches we saw hitchhiking?

                         CLIVE
          Apart from her. I suppose that's
          why they established the Dreamland
          facility out here.

                         GRAHAM
          Far from prying eyes.

                         CLIVE
          Did you know the site was selected
          in the mid-1950s for testing of the
          U-2 spyplane, due to its
          remoteness, proximity to existing
          facilities and presence of a dry
          lake bad for landings?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         CLIVE
          Oh.

                         GRAHAM
          Shall we have a bite before or
          after we hit the Black Mailbox?

                         CLIVE
          Before.

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
          customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
          related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
          speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
          bumper stickers.

                         PAT
          "Watch The Skies" or "Alien
          Onboard?"
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
          looking back at PAT.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          "Alien Onboard."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         PAT
          Nice choice. So, where have you
          boys come from?

                         GRAHAM

                         (MUMBLY)
          San Diego.

                         PAT
          Comic-Con?

                         CLIVE
          How could you tell?
          We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
          the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.

                         PAT
          Just a guess. My nephew launched a
          comic down there a couple of years
          ago. Sort of dramatized the
          accounts of some of the folk we've
          had in here.

                         CLIVE
          Encounter Briefs?

                         PAT
          That's it. You heard of it, huh?

                         CLIVE
          I've got all six.

                         PAT
          Well whaddya know? Small world.

                         CLIVE
          Do you get a lot of UFO types round
          here?
          We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
          paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.

                         PAT
          Some.

                         GRAHAM
          Have you ever seen one?

                         PAT
          A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.

                         GRAHAM
          Really?! You've seen more than one
          UFOs?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PAT
          Well, I don't know what they were.
          So as far as I'm concerned they're
          unidentified and they were
          definitely flying.

                         CLIVE
          And objects.

                         PAT
          Damn straight. Whether or not they
          were spaceships, I can't say.
          Probably not, but I'd like to think
          they were. Be a shame if we were
          the only souls in the universe.

                         CLIVE
          Did you now, it's estimated that
          there are as many as 200 billion
          galaxies in the observable universe
          and each of those has approximately
          40 billion starts, around which
          orbit countless planets and moons?

                         PAT
          Yes.

                         CLIVE
          Oh.

                         PAT
          Makes you think though, don't it?

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAT
          Where is everybody?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.

                         PAT
          You boys all set?

                         CLIVE
          I'd like a cup of coffee please.

                         PAT
          Sure thing. How about you, sugar?

                         GRAHAM
          Can I have an E.T. malt please?

                         PAT
          You wanna sparkler in that?
          GRAHAM smiles coyly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         PAT
          I'll take that as a yes.
          She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.

                         CLIVE
          It's nice here, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          Absolutely.

                         CLIVE
          I think I might use the loo.
          CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent
          toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.

                         PAT
          Yes dear, what can I get you?

                         JAKE
          Two beers.

                         PAT
          Coming right up.

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING

          CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
          is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
          mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.

                         CLIVE
          That is absolutely amazing!

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

          CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.

                         CLIVE
          Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up
          into my palms.
          CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
          strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.

                         CLIVE
          I'm joking, of course. They have a
          soap dispenser, shaped like an
          alien's head. When you pump his
          jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.

                         GRAHAM

                         (MUMBLING)
          Clive...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         CLIVE
          It's hilarious.
          GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.

                         CLIVE
          What?
          CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
          CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.

          PAT (O.S.)
          Here it comes!
          GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
          men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
          drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
          looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.

                         PAT
          Okay then, beers for you gentleman.
          A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
          with a sparkler for the boys from
          outer space.
          The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.

                         PAT
          So, where you boys headed?

                         JAKE
          We're heading into Utah. Do
          ourselves some hunting.

                         GUS
          Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps
          in front of the bangstick, right
          Jake?
          They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         JAKE
          You got that right, Gus.

                         PAT
          Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts
          up quite a fight.

                         GUS
          That's what we're counting on.
          They nudge each other and laugh.

                         PAT
          I better make you something good
          and hot. Long way to The Beehive.
          PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and
          fumbles for hi wallet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
          comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him
          a wink. He leaves.

          INT/EXT. RV - EVENING

          GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The
          engine is running.

                         CLIVE
          What took you so long?

                         GRAHAM
          I was putting the sticker on.

                         CLIVE
          They were an odd pair, weren't
          they?

                         GRAHAM
          Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
          CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.

          GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          That wasn't their truck was it?

                         CLIVE
          No.

          EXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING

          The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his
          rear view.

                         GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                         CLIVE
          Nothing. How we doing?

                         GRAHAM
          We should be just about there.
          They scan the roadside for a few seconds.

                         CLIVE
          I've found it.

                         GRAHAM
          Where?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CLIVE

          THERE!!!

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
          moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door
          opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
          They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE

                         (REVERENTIALLY)
          The Black Mailbox.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
          the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.

                         CLIVE
          It's amazing, isn't it? We're
          actually here.

                         GRAHAM
          Area 51.

                         CLIVE
          Dreamland.

                         GRAHAM
          The Groom Lake Military Test
          Facility.

                         CLIVE
          MacArthur's Black Mile.

                         GRAHAM
          Is that a real one?

                         CLIVE
          No, I made it up myself.

                         GRAHAM
          I like it.

                         CLIVE
          Be great if we saw something.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by
          a craft.

                         CLIVE
          That would be incredible. It just
          sort of stops in the air and hovers
          then just goes up really fast.
          Whoosh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         GRAHAM
          What would you do if they actually
          landed?

                         CLIVE
          Keep it together. First contact is
          a big responsibility. They come in
          peace, we go to pieces? That's not
          how I roll.
          CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.

                         CLIVE
          What's wrong?
          GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.

                         GRAHAM
          It's them. They found us. I don't
          know how but they found us.

                         CLIVE
          Who? Who's found us?

                         GRAHAM
          The Libyans!

                         CLIVE
          Run for it Marty!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the
          RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.

                         GRAHAM
          Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps
          whoever it was turned doff.

                         CLIVE
          Of course it's them. We're dead.
          It's like Deliverance. They're
          going to rape us and break our
          arms.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't want my arms broken!

                         CLIVE
          There's only one thing for it.

                         GRAHAM
          What?

                         CLIVE
          I'm gonna have to fly blind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
          still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.

                         CLIVE
          Probably best not to do that. I
          couldn't really see anything.
          They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
          the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.

                         CLIVE
          Oh God, oh God, oh God.

                         GRAHAM
          I need the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Me too.
          The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.

                         CLIVE
          They're trying to overtake.

                         GRAHAM
          Don't let them get past.

                         CLIVE
          Should I ram them?

                         GRAHAM
          What about the deposit?
          CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
          BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
          avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
          widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
          bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
          its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.

                         CLIVE
          It wasn't them.
          The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE peer out of the window.

                         CLIVE
          We should see if they're okay.

                         GRAHAM
          I still need a wee.

                         CLIVE
          I can hold mine.
          GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
          remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
          Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         GRAHAM
          The bulb's gone in there.

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
          Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.

                         CLIVE
          Hello?
          They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe you should call for help.
          GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
          sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
          cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
          black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.

                         CLIVE
          I rather think these men need help.
          Graham, give me the phone.
          GRAHAM passes the phone over.

                         VOICE
          Seriously, I wouldn't do that.
          GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
          to his ear. We hear the operator.

                         OPERATOR
          911 Emergency. How may I direct
          your call? Hello? Hello?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
          into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front
          of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an

          ALIEN.

                         ALIEN
          Put - the phone - down.
          Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
          backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
          GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
          speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.

                         GRAHAM
          What have you done to him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ALIEN
          I didn't do anything. He fainted.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes but you made him faint.

                         ALIEN
          I did not. Okay I did, but it's not
          like i set my phaser to "Faint'.

                         GRAHAM
          You've got a phaser!?

                         ALIEN
          No! Look, I need you to help. Can
          you get this guy back onto your
          wagon?

                         GRAHAM
          Are you going to probe us?

                         ALIEN
          No! Where does that come from? Why
          do people always assume we want to
          stick something up their ass?

                         GRAHAM
          Don't you?

                         ALIEN
          No. There's certainly nothing about
          it in the encounter manual. As a
          rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
          people find it easier to deal with
          earthly transgressions if they
          suppress it with absurd fantasies
          about alien probing.

                         GRAHAM
          What?

                         ALIEN
          It's just a theory. Listen, focus
          okay? I promise you I won't hurt
          you, I just need your help.

                         GRAHAM
          You need my help?

                         ALIEN
          Yes.

                         GRAHAM
          How come I can understand you? Are
          you using some sort of neural
          language router?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         ALIEN
          No, I'm speaking English you prick.
          (off GRAHAM's expression)
          Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your
          name?

                         GRAHAM
          Graham Willy.

                         ALIEN
          What about him?

                         GRAHAM
          That's the writer, Clive Gollings.

                         ALIEN
          Well, let's get Clive into the RV
          and get going. I'll explain
          everything on the way. Please.

                         GRAHAM
          Where are we going?

                         ALIEN
          North.

                         GRAHAM
          The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.

                         ALIEN
          Well, then we're gonna have to
          hustle, aren't we?

                         GRAHAM

                         BUT-

                         ALIEN
          Look Graham, you're just gonna have
          to trust me, okay?
          GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
          His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to
          one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers
          clasp together, pleading.

                         ALIEN
          Please man, I need you.
          GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.

                         GRAHAM
          Okay then.

                         ALIEN
          Great. Thank you.

                         GRAHAM
          What's your name?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         ALIEN
          I'm Paul.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield
          onto the recreational vehicle and
          get the fuck off MacArthur's Black
          Mile.
          They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Oh man, has he...?

                         GRAHAM
          I told him he should have gone.

                         PAUL
          Could have been worse. Know what
          I'm saying?
          They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
          later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
          He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
          starts up and drives off.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
          times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.

                         PAUL
          Can I have this ham?

                         GRAHAM
          Uh... yes.

                         PAUL
          Great!
          PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
          wolfing it down hungrily.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul? Where am I going again?

                         PAUL
          I told you, North. Do you have a
          map?
          GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.

                         PAUL
          Not when we're driving, Graham.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          The map disappears back up into the roller.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.

                         PAUL
          Just head North. We need to get as
          much distance as we can between us
          and them.

                         GRAHAM
          Them? Who's them?

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a
          dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
          man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
          The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
          mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
          Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A
          SOLDIER approaches.

                         CAPTAIN
          Sir?

                         ZOIL
          Talk to me.

                         CAPTAIN
          Three survivors, company men, hurt
          but alive.

                         ZOIL
          Anyone else?

                         CAPTAIN
          No sir.
          ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.

                         CAPTAIN
          What's this?
          The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
          ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.

                         CAPTAIN
          What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?

                         ZOIL
          No. It's neither of those things.
          He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
          side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
          his car and hits a button on the dash.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         VOICE
          What's the situation?

                         ZOIL
          We have a guest who's left the
          hotel without paying, sir.

                         VOICE
          Damn it! Do you think he's "left'
          left?

                         ZOIL
          Doubtful. NORAD would have picked
          up a bogie. Those guys can track
          Santa. No sir, he's still here.
          Question is, for how long?

                         VOICE
          Don't you think this is all a bit
          of a coincidence?

                         ZOIL
          How so?

                         VOICE
          I signed the red document this
          morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's
          odd that he chooses today to go
          AWOL? How did he know?

                         ZOIL
          Are you suggesting he has someone
          on the inside.

                         VOICE
          Maybe.

                         ZOIL
          Well he's definitely got someone on
          the outside.

                         VOICE
          What?

                         ZOIL
          Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks...
          among other things. I'd bet my left
          nut that little bastard's hitched a
          ride.

                         VOICE
          Lock down the area. Road blocks,
          spot checks, the whole nine yards.
          You're going to handle this
          personally, Zoil. I want this
          wrapped up before Letterman.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER

          Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
          Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
          the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
          notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
          see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
          bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
          CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
          skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.

                         PAUL
          The bulb's gone in there.
          CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
          middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
          PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.

                         PAUL
          I hate it when you get the closed
          ones, right?

                         GRAHAM
          I usually bite them open.

                         PAUL
          Are you fucking insane? You gotta
          tap "em and if they don't open you
          throw them away.

                         GRAHAM
          That's molluscs.

                         PAUL
          Shut up.

                         GRAHAM
          It's true.

                         (NOTICES CLIVE)
          Hello Clive! How are you feeling?

                         CLIVE
          I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL
          MAD, Graham. If that is your name?
          You're happily sitting there
          chatting to... to... that, like
          it's the most natural thing in the
          world. The two of you laughing away
          like you haven't seen each other
          since 1990.
          PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          CLIVE (CONT'D)
          So forgive me if I seem a little
          rattled but from where I'm standing
          it would appear you are trading nut
          knowledge with an alien life form.

                         GRAHAM
          His name is Paul.

                         CLIVE
          Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
          Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
          Reiser?

                         PAUL
          Just Paul. You know, like Madonna
          or Dracula.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul's from a small planet in the
          northern spiral arm of the
          Andromeda Galaxy.

                         CLIVE
          No he is not!

                         PAUL
          I am man, seriously.

                         CLIVE
          How could he possibly have
          travelled that distance?

                         PAUL
          Wormhole.

                         CLIVE
          Balls! Graham, this isn't what it
          seems. What about Ocham's Razor?

                         GRAHAM
          The hairdressers?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, the old man who owns it told
          me that, in unbelievable
          circumstances, the most plausible
          explanation is usually the truth.

                         PAUL
          And what's the most plausible
          explanation, Clive?

                         CLIVE
          That you're a thin midget in an
          alien costume.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         PAUL
          There's no such thing as a thin
          midget? Those guys are built. Have
          you not seen The Station Agent?

                         GRAHAM
          He's right. I think that's less
          believable than Paul being form a
          planet in the norther spiral arm of
          the Andromeda Galaxy.

          CLIVE (CONT'D)
          Oh really?
          With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
          trying to gain a hold of a mask.

                         PAUL
          Ow! Get off me!

                         CLIVE
          You're not real. You're not real!

                         GRAHAM
          Excuse me.

                         PAUL
          Get off me, you fucking psycho!

                         GRAHAM

          EXCUSE ME!
          CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
          flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.

                         CLIVE
          Oh shit!
          CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
          pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.

                         CLIVE
          Where's he gone?

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe he beamed up.

                         CLIVE
          As if. We would have seen the
          classic shimmer and hum.

                         GRAHAM
          Good point.

          BANG, BANG, BANG!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an
          AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from
          the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.

                         AGENT 1
          Where you boys from? Australia?

                         CLIVE
          Britain.

                         AGENT 1
          Ah. G'day mate.
          The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.

                         AGENT 1
          Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?

                         CLIVE/GRAHAM
          Comic-con.

                         AGENT 1
          You're a long way from San Diego.

                         CLIVE
          We were having a little drive.

                         AGENT 1
          Is that right?

          AGENT 2 (O.S.)
          Hey Haggard?!

                         HAGGARD
          Yeah?
          O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.

                         O'REILLY
          These guys have met Michael Biehn.

                         HAGGARD
          No shit! How was he?

                         CLIVE
          He was a good egg.

                         GRAHAM
          Very unaffected.

                         HAGGARD
          That's nice to hear.

                         (TO AGENT 2)
          O'Reilly? Anything else?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         O'REILLY
          Just some pissy jeans.
          HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
          CLIVE look embarrassed.

                         HAGGARD
          Okay, you guys can go.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you. May I ask what you're
          searching for?

                         HAGGARD
          Of course you may.
          There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
          and shaken.

                         CLIVE
          Well, it's pretty obvious what
          happened there, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          Is it?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, the government used some sort
          of neurotoxic paint on the Black
          Mailbox, which was white by the
          way, and it caused us to suffer a
          shared hallucination about an
          alien. I mean, it's what we've
          always wanted, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          I suppose so.

                         CLIVE
          Than that's what happened.
          PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.

                         PAUL

          WRONG!

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

          The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two
          AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the
          distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          INT. RV - NIGHT


                         CLIVE
          Where the hell did you go?

                         PAUL
          Nowhere.

                         GRAHAM
          What, you went invisible?

                         PAUL
          It's not invisibility per so. It's
          more like what a chameleon does
          with a little light blending thrown
          in for good measure.

                         GRAHAM
          Like Predator?

                         PAUL
          Exactly.

                         GRAHAM
          Can you do it whenever you want?

                         PAUL

                         (PREDATOR VOICE)
          Anytime...

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road
          into the night.

          INT. RV - DAYBREAK

          CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat
          eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes
          on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.

                         CLIVE
          No thank you.

                         PAUL
          You sure? How about a cup of
          coffee?
          (sees he's tempted)
          Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice
          cuppa J.
          PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
          he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.

                         PAUL
          Hey, look who's up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         GRAHAM
          Hello Paul.
          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.

                         GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                         CLIVE
          Graham, there is a Grey in the
          galley, making me coffee.

                         GRAHAM
          Did you want tea?

                         CLIVE
          No, I don't want tea.

                         GRAHAM
          Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't
          it?

                         CLIVE
          No, what's wried, Graham, is that
          we have picked up an extra
          terrestrial hitch hiker and you
          seem completely fine with it!

                         GRAHAM
          He needs our help, Clive.
          PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their
          conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.

                         PAUL CLIVE
          You got it? Yes I've got it.

                         PAUL CLIVE
          It's hot. (slightly testy)
          Thank you.
          GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and
          sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...

                         PAUL
          Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a
          limb and say this is probably the
          weirdest thing that's ever happened
          to you. Am i right?
          CLIVE doesn't deny it.

                         PAUL
          And I appreciate the fact that I
          have somewhat gate-crashed the
          party here but, truth be told, I'm
          in a hell of a pickle. I really
          need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CLIVE
          Why us?

                         PAUL
          Why not?
          CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.

                         CLIVE
          What about the RV? It has to be
          back in two days.

                         GRAHAM
          Clive, he's an alien. A living,
          breathing, alien.
          CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand
          gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.

                         CLIVE
          I suppose we could phone the hire
          company and get an extension.
          PAUL looks super-pleased.

                         CLIVE
          How did you get here?

                         PAUL
          Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.

                         GRAHAM
          Happens to the best of us.

                         PAUL
          Also, I'm a shit driver.

                         CLIVE
          Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!

                         PAUL
          Roswell was a smoke-screen man,
          designed to distract from the
          truth.

                         CLIVE
          They invented a fake alien crash to
          distract from an actual alien
          crash?

                         PAUL
          I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?

                         CLIVE
          What have you been doing here all
          this time?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         PAUL
          Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting
          the shit. Advising the government.

                         GRAHAM
          Not just the government.

          INT. ROOM - DAY


                         CAPTION: 1980
          A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and
          chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a
          cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on
          the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          ...I want him to have some kind of
          special power, you know? Something
          sort of messianic...

                         PAUL
          How about molecular revivification.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          I don't know what that is.

                         PAUL
          Restoration of damaged tissue
          through telepathic manipulation of
          cellular intrinsic field memory.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          I...uh...

                         PAUL
          Healing, Steven.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort
          of thing? His little finger could
          light up at the end and-

                         PAUL
          You know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The line beeps.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          You got another call?

                         PAUL
          Yeah I gotta take this man. It's
          the fucking V guys again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         PAUL
          Right.

                         GRAHAM
          You'd be surprised how much he's
          influenced popular culture
          generally over the last 60 years.

                         CLIVE

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          How come you know so much?

                         GRAHAM
          We had quite a long chat while you
          were unconscious.
          CLIVE looks miffed.

                         GRAHAM
          ...while you were asleep.

                         PAUL
          You want a bagel Clive?

                         CLIVE
          No thanks.

                         PAUL
          Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes please.

                         CLIVE
          Go on then, I'll have half.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          You want anything on it?

                         CLIVE
          Jam.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          What?

                         CLIVE
          Jelly.

                         PAUL
          Gotcha.
          PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.

                         GRAHAM
          I gave your jeans a swill and hung
          them up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you. So, do you know where
          we're going?

                         GRAHAM
          Just North. He said we had to make
          a right at Utah.

                         CLIVE
          Why can't he tell us?

                         GRAHAM
          He said it was a surprise.

                         CLIVE
          Do you trust him, Graham? I mean,
          is he Strider or Black Rider?

                         GRAHAM
          Strider, definitely.

                         CLIVE
          You'd better be right. I don't want
          to wake up and find him inserting a
          probe into my anus.

                         GRAHAM
          It's okay, he doesn't do that.
          PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.

                         PAUL
          Bagel time!
          The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.

                         GRAHAM
          Fuel level's critical.

                         PAUL
          Sorry, I had a warning light just
          like that on my ship.

                         GRAHAM
          For fuel?

                         PAUL
          Anti-grav failure.
          CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.

                         CLIVE
          There's a place called Ely five
          miles from here. It's small but
          there should be a gas station.

                         GRAHAM
          Roger that, number one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
          PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".

          INT. RV - MORNING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears
          deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a
          V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD
          MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.

                         CLIVE
          Paul, don't do that!

                         PAUL
          Here's what I need. Some organic
          beef mince, organic pork, some
          veal, red onions, pine nuts,
          pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a
          fistful of fresh basil and 3 war
          ciabattas.

                         CLIVE
          You know this is a gas station?
          PAUL looks disappointed.

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

          The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the
          forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.

                         CLIVE
          Ready?

                         GRAHAM
          Ready.
          HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Get me some more peanut M&Ms.
          GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE
          CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles
          the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout
          as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he
          tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time
          as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.

                         STATE TROOPER
          After you.

                         CLIVE
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING

          Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.

                         O'REILLY
          Coming... ready or not!
          O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
          ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.

                         ZOIL
          Orange?

                         O'REILLY
          No thanks.

                         ZOIL
          Nice and juicy.

                         O'REILLY
          I don't want to spoil breakfast.

                         ZOIL
          Do you mind telling me what's going
          on, Agent?

                         O'REILLY
          Just keeping ourselves occupied
          sir. Things are pretty slow.

                         ZOIL
          Where's the other one?

                         O'REILLY
          I don't know, let's see. Haggard?
          HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on
          the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a
          snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.

                         HAGGARD
          Sorry, I was just... hiding.

                         ZOIL
          I see. You fellas had much traffic
          through here?

                         HAGGARD
          Just a big RV driven by a couple of
          nerds.

                         ZOIL
          Nerds, huh?

                         HAGGARD
          Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and
          met Michael Biehn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         ZOIL
          I've heard he's nice.

                         HAGGARD
          Good egg.

                         O'REILLY
          Very unaffected.

                         ZOIL
          Did you search the vehicle
          thoroughly?

                         O'REILLY
          Yes sir.

                         ZOIL
          Find anything?

                         O'REILLY
          Not really. Just Michael Biehn's
          autograph and some pissy jeans.
          Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.

                         ZOIL
          Did you get the license plate?
          HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.

                         ZOIL
          Make?
          More sheepishness.

                         HAGGARD
          It was big.

                         ZOIL
          I want everything you can remember.
          Descriptions of the occupants,
          height, hair, distinguishing
          features. We can do it on the way.

                         HAGGARD
          On the way?

                         ZOIL
          You're coming with me.

                         O'REILLY
          What about the road block sir?

                         ZOIL
          It didn't work.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. GAS STATION - MORNING

          GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of
          jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some
          mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.

                         CLIVE
          Don't you think that's a bit much?
          Put it all back. Except the
          burrito... and the doughnuts... and
          the chocolate milk. Let's just pay
          for it and leave.

                         GRAHAM
          We need bulb for the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Essential only, Graham!
          They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Morning Chris!

                         CHRIS
          Hey Dean.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Who do you think I had in my office
          this morning?

                         CHRIS
          Jeremy Piven?

                         STATE TROOPER
          No. The Secret Service.
          GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it
          tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.

                         CHRIS
          They find out how you can afford a
          Dodge Viper on troopers pay?

                         STATE TROOPER
          Not yet. They're all over this
          crash on the road up to Rachel.

                         CHRIS
          What you think's going on?

                         STATE TROOPER
          Don't know, could be Muslims.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Cheeerist!
          CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         STATE TROOPER
          You go right ahead.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you very much, officer.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Where're you guys from?

                         GRAHAM
          Britain.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!

                         CHRIS
          No guns? Jesus Cheeerist.
          CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER
          and CHRIS watch them go.

          EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

          The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear
          the radio spring to life as they pass.

                         POLICE CONTROLLER
          All units, be on the lookout for a
          cream and brown Recreational
          Vehicle, no plate number at this
          time. Officers are advised to
          contain but not board. Dean, if you
          still at Gas and Go, bring back a
          quart a milk and a box of doughnut
          holes? Dean?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.

          HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK!

          INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER

          PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM
          drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.

                         CLIVE
          It's find for you. You'll get
          whisked back to whatever lab they
          kept you in and we'll be arrested
          for harbouring a fugitive and sent
          to Guantanamo Bay.
          PAUL laughs.

                         CLIVE
          Why's everything so funny? They
          think we're Muslims.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         PAUL
          That's their excuse for everything.
          There are worse things you can be.
          We had a Muslim guy at the base.
          Systems analyst called Yusef. We
          used to do karaoke on Tuesday
          nights. You should'a heard him do
          Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get
          a chance to say salam alaikum.

                         CLIVE
          Paul, the authorities know we're in
          an TV.

                         PAUL
          We're hardly the only RV on the
          road. Trust me, if we stay off the
          highways, keep to the back routes,
          we'll have a nice uneventful
          journey.
          BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.
          GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
          The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road
          lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.

                         PAUL
          Fuck, that made me jump.

                         CLIVE
          Ah yes, the waspish markings of a
          Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.

                         PAUL
          What a waste.

                         GRAHAM
          Poor thing.

                         CLIVE
          Nothing anyone could've done.
          PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.

                         GRAHAM
          What are you doing?
          PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
          slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
          its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
          they are seeing.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a miracle!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.

                         PAUL
          I'll miss these.

                         CLIVE
          Why would you do that?

                         PAUL
          I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am

          I?

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

          ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas
          station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.

                         STATE TROOPER
          By the time I got the bulletin,
          they were long gone. Seemed like
          nice fellas to me.

                         CHRIS
          Is it true they was Muslims?

                         STATE TROOPER
          They said they were British.

                         ZOIL
          I think you can be both.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Cheeeeerist!

                         HAGGARD
          Agent Zoil?

                         ZOIL
          Excuse me gentlemen.
          ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The
          voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.

                         VOICE
          Report.

                         ZOIL
          We've tracked them down to a gas
          station in Ely.

                         VOICE
          So why am I not witting with my
          feet up, smoking a jay, watching
          Erin Brockovich?

                         ZOIL
          We think he may be travelling in an
          RV with two British men sir.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         VOICE
          Goddamnit, I knew we should have
          gone ahead with invasion in "44.
          What are they, MI6?

                         ZOIL
          No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on
          the lamb from Comic-Con.

                         VOICE
          Shit. My sister's kid went to that.
          Little Manga faggot.

                         ZOIL
          I still think this stinks, sir.

                         VOICE
          Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much
          of a coincidence. He sits tight for
          60 years and then suddenly now he
          decides to take off. If he wanted
          to go home so bad, he could've just
          given us the slip when he was
          playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.

                         ZOIL
          Someone must have told him. We need
          to find the rat.

                         VOICE
          Leave that to me. In the meantime,
          if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.
          then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a
          new A. O.K.?

                         ZOIL
          Yes sir.

          INT. RV - DUSK

          GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva,
          Queen Of The Varvak. CLIVE drives.

                         GRAHAM
          What do you think?

                         PAUL
          Ask me when I've finished it.
          CLIDE rubs his yes.

                         GRAHAM
          You tired, Sausage?

                         CLIVE

                         (WHISPERING)
          Don't call me Sausage in front of
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry. Are you tired though?

                         CLIVE
          Mummy, I am bushed.

                         GRAHAM
          What do you need?

                         CLIVE
          Best case, I'd like a cold flannel
          on my neck and an honest meal.

                         GRAHAM
          I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still
          call you Big-Rig can't I?

                         CLIVE
          Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck
          with an RV park? We need somewhere
          off the beaten track, n'est pas?

                         GRAHAM
          Roger that. Cup of Joe?

                         CLIVE
          You read my mind.
          GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
          Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.

                         CLIVE
          Can I help you?

                         PAUL
          You want a cigarette?

                         CLIVE
          No, thank you. I don't smoke.
          PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.

                         PAUL
          Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating
          the bird.
          CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
          coffee and a Honey Bun cake.

                         GRAHAM
          Honey Bun?

                         CLIVE
          Could you unwrap it for me?

                         GRAHAM
          By your command.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL
          watches. GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.

                         PAUL
          Let me ask you something. Are you
          to...?

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAUL
          You know...
          PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
          various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.

                         CLIVE
          No!

                         PAUL
          Okay, that's great. I just
          wondered. I'm cool with it.
          Everyone's "bi' where I'm from.
          It's all about the pleasure thing,
          you know? We've evolved beyond
          paranoid notions of gender
          identity. I mean, procreation is
          only the functional aspect of
          sexual congress right? The human
          race is fairly advanced but most
          males still act like a cornered
          tiger if you imply the like
          "smoking the bone' and let's face
          it they probably do. Look at single
          sex, empirical institutions,
          boarding schools, prisons, pirate
          ships, places where the choice has
          been removed, everyone's banging
          everyone else and there isn't a
          whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
          out into the real world and guys
          are getting smacked int he chops
          for wearing pink socks. You think
          you're so sophisticated because you
          can distinguish yourself from your
          own reflection but ultimately
          you're part of a deeply neurotic
          species and you'd all be a lot
          better off if you stopped worrying
          and learned to love the bum.

                         CLIVE
          What are you trying to say?

                         PAUL
          Maybe you should start smoking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. RV - EVENING

          Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
          GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,
          steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.

                         CLIVE
          Great find, Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          I sourced a website listing off the
          beaten track, North American RV
          parks.

                         PAUL
          I really lucked out with you nerds,
          didn't I?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed
          hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.

                         GRAHAM
          It's awfully quiet.

                         CLIVE
          Just the way we like it.
          PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
          the horn.

          HOOOOOOONNNNK!

                         CLIVE
          Stop doing that!

                         GRAHAM
          Someone's coming.
          PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.

                         VOICE
          Hello?

                         CLIVE
          (quietly to Graham)
          We're just a couple of regular guys
          on a tour of the less touristy side
          of the American midwest.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't think she heard you.

                         CLIVE
          I was talking to you.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh, sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         VOICE
          Hello?
          GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
          twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She
          wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares
          at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton
          John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".

                         RUTH
          Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.

                         CLIVE
          Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come
          in?

                         RUTH
          Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is
          $50 for the night, plus $10 for
          hook ups an I'll need to hang onto
          an ID too.
          CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.

                         GRAHAM
          We're just a couple of regular guys
          on tour of the less touristy side
          of the American midwest.

                         RUTH
          Where you heading next?

                         GRAHAM
          Uh, east... apparently.
          CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.

                         RUTH
          England?

                         CLIVE
          Yes. London.

                         RUTH
          I love London.

                         CLIVE
          Have you been?

                         RUTH
          No. Did you know it was founded by
          the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Yes.

                         RUTH
          Oh. I'd love to go someday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         GRAHAM
          You should.

                         RUTH
          There's lots a places I wanna go.
          Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The
          world's a big place. I need one of
          these though.

                         CLIVE
          You don't have a passport?
          RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry

                         RUTH
          That's my father. I'll come over
          and take your money in the morning.
          Have a pleasant night now, won't
          you?
          RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM
          watches RUTH intently as they pass.

                         CLIVE
          Doors to manual and cross check.
          Graham? Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          Hmmm?
          PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         PAUL

          BOO!

          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

          RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we
          hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns
          back, and goes inside.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
          From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a
          police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We
          perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          What took you so long?

                         RUTH
          I was just talking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves
          an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          You talk to much.

                         RUTH
          Sorry Papa.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          How long they staying?

                         RUTH
          Just the night I think

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Hook ups?

                         RUTH
          Uh-huh.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Where they headed?

                         RUTH
          East.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Them California plates I saw?

                         RUTH
          Yes, but they're from London.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          London, Ohio?

                         RUTH
          No, London, England.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Where?!

                         RUTH
          England, Papa. It's in North
          Western Europe.
          The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands
          the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is
          tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Europe? I'll give you Europe,
          missy. Now, get and make my supper.
          MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          EXT. RV PARK - LATER

          QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the
          RV and prepare a small BBQ.

          INT. RV - MOMENTS LATER

          The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL
          lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.

                         PAUL
          Arrghh, what the fuck?!

                         GRAHAM
          Hungry?

                         PAUL
          I ate already.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.

                         PAUL
          Too soon?
          They nod.

                         PAUL
          Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break
          bread with you guys. What are we
          having?
          GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.

                         GRAHAM
          Willies!
          PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.

                         CLIVE
          I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's
          my forte.
          CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
          mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and
          slams the door of the RV behind him.

          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

          CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his
          tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes
          nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         PAUL
          Hello Clive. From the squirting of
          the gas and the flicking of the
          tongue, am I do assume you're a
          Hendrix fan?

                         CLIVE
          I am actually, yes.

                         PAUL
          I met him once.

                         CLIVE
          Really?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He
          thought I was a hallucination.
          Shame what happened to him.

                         CLIVE
          All the good ones die.

                         PAUL
          Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases
          album seventeen.
          PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.

                         CLIVE
          So you've been here for 60 years?

                         PAUL
          I know, right? Time flies when
          you're confined to a U.S. military
          installation.

                         CLIVE
          Why did you come to earth?

                         PAUL
          I'm the vanguard of a highly
          aggressive invading force.

                         CLIVE
          What?!

                         PAUL
          I'm fucking with you, man. I was on
          a science mission actually.
          Meteorological reconnaissance. We
          were surveying atmospheric
          conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class
          planets. My specialist subject is
          tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing
          around the mid-west, looking for
          twisters and all of a sudden my
          A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in
          the middle of some field.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
          Next thing I know, this little girl
          is pulling me out of the wreck and
          then a bunch of army guys come
          along and cart me off to Area 52.

                         CLIVE

          51.

                         PAUL
          No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full
          of old Pan Am jets and mini disc
          players and shit. It's another
          "clever subterfuge."
          GRAHAM joins them with the food.

                         PAUL
          Just telling him about Area 52.

                         GRAHAM
          Ha ha yeah.

                         PAUL
          So, with my cover blown and the
          natives cautious but friendly, I
          figured we might as well indulge in
          a little file sharing.

                         CLIVE
          Mulder was right!

                         PAUL
          Mulder was my idea.
          They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.

                         CLIVE
          Would you like a go?
          PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the
          Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.

          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
          on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
          pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
          against the campfire. She frowns.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

          RUTH!
          RUTH backs away into the shadows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          INT. RV - MORNING

          It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
          There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.

                         CLIVE
          Who is it?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          It's Ruth.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
          the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.

                         RUTH
          Good morning.

                         CLIVE
          Good morning.

                         RUTH
          May I come in?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.
          CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as
          RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.

                         RUTH
          Was everything to your liking?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, thank you.

                         RUTH
          Where's the other one?

                         CLIVE
          The other one?

                         RUTH
          It's okay, we don't charge by the
          person. That was three pairs of
          legs I saw last night cavorting
          round the camp fire, right?

                         CLIVE
          Oh the other one. Um...

                         PAUL
          I'm in the can. I ate a closed
          mollusc.
          PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         GRAHAM
          I like your shirt.
          The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
          the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"

                         RUTH
          Thanks. I got it at my church.

                         GRAHAM
          Why would Jesus want to shoot
          Charles Darwin?

                         RUTH

                         (BRIGHTLY)
          Because of his theories. Are you
          men of God?

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a coffee?

                         CLIVE
          I suppose we're men of science.

                         GRAHAM

                         CLIVE-
          RUTH narrow her eye.

                         CLIVE
          If we believe in anything it would
          be macro evolution. Cause and
          effect. The establishment of a
          biological order from the maelstrom
          of physical and chemical chaos.
          RUTH looks scandalized.

                         GRAHAM
          Or it could be God. You just don't
          know do you?

                         RUTH
          God created the earth in six days
          and on the seventh he rested.
          PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Did you know that the universe has
          been dated as being 13.5 billion
          years old an that the release of
          neutral hydrogen at the moment of
          the big bang has enabled scientists
          to do this with categorical
          accuracy?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CLIVE
          Not you!

                         RUTH
          The world is 4000 years old.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Oh come on!

                         GRAHAM

                         PAUL-

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Horseshit!
          RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
          unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.

                         RUTH
          Explain to me how something as
          complicated as the human eye simply
          comes into being.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Oh, don't give me that old
          irreducible complexity crap-

                         RUTH
          They eye is comprised of three
          interacting parts. Remove any one
          of them and it ceases to exist. It
          has the precision and delicacy of a
          pocket watch and, when the good
          Lord permits, it works in perfect
          harmony with its environment.
          Something as functionally perfect
          as that doesn't just occur without
          the intervention of a guiding hand.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          But it didn't just occur did it? It
          is the culmination of millions of
          years of development across
          countless species.

                         RUTH
          What are you talking about?

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Evolution baby.
          RUTH screams and bangs the door.

                         RUTH
          It'd design!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          If He designed it, why didn't He
          just make it one part and take the
          whole weekend off?

                         RUTH
          Nothing you can so or do can shake
          my belief, or faith in the sure and
          certain knowledge that God made
          Heaven and earth and created us all
          in His own image.

                         PAUL
          Oh yeah?
          (stepping out of the toilet)
          Well then how do you explain me?
          RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
          up, her hair turns white. She collapses.

                         PAUL
          And that's Jenga.

                         CLIVE
          What did you do that for?

                         PAUL
          I didn't do anything, she fainted.

                         CLIVE
          She saw you!

                         PAUL
          Oh come on. Who's gonna believe
          anything she says?

                         CLIVE
          The authorities will be on the look
          out for exactly this sort of thing.

                         PAUL
          What, a delusional, one-eyed God
          botherer?

                         CLIVE
          Paul, right now they're going to
          follow any lead they can get.

                         PAUL
          I didn't think of that.

                         GRAHAM
          We could take her with us.

                         PAUL/CLIVE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         GRAHAM
          We're only going to be a couple of
          days. We could let her go once
          Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll
          be fine once she gets to know us.
          PAUL and CLIVE consider this.

                         CLIVE
          How am I going to get my passport
          back?
          PAUL vanishes.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Leave it to me.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the
          kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
          He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he
          spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
          finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.

                         PAUL
          Hallelujah.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Ruth, what in the Lord's name-
          MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for
          a second.

                         PAUL
          Boo?

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is
          loading a shotgun.

                         PAUL

          GO! GO! GO!
          The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM
          appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as
          MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
          arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
          booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
          RV careens off out of the trailer park.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,
          GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         GRAHAM
          Hi.

                         RUTH
          Where am I?
          PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.

                         PAUL
          Hey, look who's up.

                         RUTH

          DEMON!

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a cup of tea?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm so sorry it had to be this way
          Ruth. We're definitely not going to
          hurt you and we'll let you go as
          son as we can. We were just a
          little concerned that you might
          call the police.

                         RUTH
          You have been deceived. Deceived by
          an agent of Satan himself.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          You know I'm sitting right here?

                         GRAHAM
          He's not a demon Ruth, he's from
          another world and we're helping him
          get home. He's not evil. He's just
          very rude.

                         RUTH
          How can he be from another world?
          There is only one world. Our world,
          created by God the Father.
          PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.

                         PAUL
          Look, if it makes you feel any
          better, my existence only disproves
          the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-
          Christian God, as well as all
          single earth theologies. Science
          still hasn't categorically rule out
          the notion of divinity, even though
          evolutionary biology suggest the
          non-existence of a creator by
          probability alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         RUTH
          How could that possibly make me
          feel any better?

                         PAUL
          Jesus Christ, I was just trying to
          be nice!

                         GRAHAM
          I think what Paul's trying to say
          is, just because there are other
          inhabited planets, it's not the end
          of the world.

                         RUTH
          This isn't happening! You're a
          hallucination. You're not real.
          You're a test. A test from God.

                         PAUL
          You can't win can you?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
          awful noise.

                         CLIVE
          I can't drive like this. We'll have
          to drop her off and take our
          chances.

                         GRAHAM
          No!

                         PAUL
          Oh, for God's sake.
          PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
          forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
          into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
          cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
          ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL
          telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They
          collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.

                         GRAHAM
          What did you do to her?!

                         PAUL
          I broadened her horizons.

                         GRAHAM
          Can you broaden mine?

                         PAUL
          No, it's tiring.
          GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh please.

                         PAUL
          Come here then.
          PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
          fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.

                         CLIVE
          Oh great! Everyone knows the
          secrets of the universe apart from
          me. He always knew what was going
          on in Buffy before me because his
          mum had cable.

                         PAUL
          Can't I just tell you?

                         CLIVE
          No spoilers!
          PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps
          CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.

                         GRAHAM

                         (WEAKLY)
          Maybe I should make that tea?

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          I didn't call the government. I
          called the po-lice.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY


                         ZOIL
          Given your description of the
          intruder, the police felt your call
          was perhaps better directed to us.

                         MOSES BEHE
          And who are you?

                         ZOIL
          Secret Service, sir.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I knew it. You know that devil took
          my Ruth.

                         ZOIL
          And Ruth's your daughter?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         MOSES BEHE
          That's right. Her Mama died when
          she was born. I good as brought her
          up by myself. Wasn't easy either.
          Two mouths to feed and this place
          to run.

                         ZOIL
          I understand. Do you have a
          photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?
          MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered
          photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes
          intact and with dark hair.

                         ZOIL
          She's pretty.
          MOSES snorts.

                         ZOIL
          Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In
          case she tries to contact you.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I do...
          ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his
          satellite phone, moving into a different room.

                         MOSES BEHE
          ...and she'll call me if she can.
          Ruth's never really been outta
          Carbon County.

                         ZOIL
          You say they went East?

                         MOSES BEHE
          Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the
          191 after Flaming Gorge if they
          ain't using the interstate, there's
          been a rig spill just South of
          Dutch John.

                         ZOIL
          So?

                         MOSES BEHE
          So that means they'll be on the 44.
          Only way to go.
          ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.

                         ZOIL
          Let's go. Haggard!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Tell me you're gonna kill that
          thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what
          it is.

                         ZOIL
          We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Watch yourself now. I seen its
          eyes. It's evil.
          ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.

                         MOSES BEHE
          God's speed, Mr. Zoil.

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          ZOIL's radio crackles to life.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          Man, that way was one fat freak!

          O'REILLY (O.S.)
          If I was that girl, I think I'd
          rather take my chances with the
          alien.
          HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.

                         ZOIL
          Can it, you two! How many times do
          I have to tell you?

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police
          scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over
          the radio.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          We do not refer to the target as
          "The Alien'.
          MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He
          glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying
          in the foreground on the kitchen table.
          We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.

          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          INT. RV - DAY

          CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.

                         PAUL
          Wow.
          Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,
          looking out through the RV's windshield.
          We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.
          They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking
          out across the vista.

                         PAUL
          There it is, boys. Wyoming.

                         CLIVE
          Is that where we're going?

                         PAUL
          Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at
          times like these you winder if the
          intelligent design crowd aren't
          onto something. I mean look at it.
          Hey Ruth, get up here.
          They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.

                         PAUL
          Ruth!?

                         CLIVE
          Someone should go after her.
          Graham?
          CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.

                         CLIVE
          Graham!?

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          RUTH is storming up the road.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth!

                         RUTH
          Leave me alone!

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, please stop, I've got shin
          splints.
          RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you alright?

                         RUTH
          He can't be from space. It's not
          possible.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's
          not just possible, it's probably.
          There's probably millions of
          intelligent civilizations.

                         RUTH
          So, where is everybody?

                         GRAHAM
          Well, one of them is right there.
          RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the
          dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.
          CLIVE is trying not to laugh.

                         RUTH
          Everything I've ever been told is a
          lie. My purpose. My truth. All
          false. DO you know how that feels?
          To suddenly have nothing?

                         GRAHAM
          Just because your truth wasn't the
          truth, it doesn't mean there is no
          truth, Ruth.

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          I understand you're probably
          feeling very confused right now.
          Religious belief systems are
          devised to give us context and
          security. To stop us feeling lonely
          and unimportant.

                         RUTH
          I do feel lonely and unimportant!
          How can this all be an accident? It
          doesn't make sense. Did you know
          the reason we have solar eclipses
          is because the sun is exactly 400
          times bigger than the moon and the
          moon is exactly 400 times closer to
          the earth?
          GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.

                         RUTH
          How can that be an accident.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         GRAHAM
          It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it
          probably is. That's the beauty of
          the universe.

                         RUTH
          But what's the point? If there's
          nothing afterwards, what's the
          point in living?

                         GRAHAM
          This is the point, Ruth. Right now.
          This conversation. That tree, your
          next cheeseburger. Life is a
          miracle. People spend so much time
          focusing on rescuing the princess,
          they forget how much fun it is to
          fight the dragon.

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or
          new, that stressed the magnificence
          of the universe as revealed by
          modern science might be able to
          draw forth reserves of reverence
          and awe hardly tapped by the
          conventional faiths.'

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's
          wonderful because it means we still
          have things to learn. We still have
          life to live.

                         RUTH
          I'm frightened.

                         GRAHAM
          So am I, but it passes, sort of.
          Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure
          and I think you should come with
          us. I know you feel confused and
          lost but if you get back on board
          that RV, you might just find the
          very thing you're looking for.

                         RUTH
          I... I'm not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I
          can honestly say, I have never
          talked to a woman for this long
          without blushing.

                         RUTH
          That's so sweet.
          GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.

          INT. RV - DAY

          GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased
          with himself.

                         GRAHAM
          She's going to be fine. I think
          your hair looks good by the way.
          You look like Storm.

                         RUTH
          Who's Storm?

                         PAUL
          From X-Men.

                         GRAHAM
          Exactly.
          RUTH goes to the bathroom.

          RUTH (O.S.)

          AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!

          EXT/INT. RV - DAY

          The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,
          RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.
          GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on
          the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.
          CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just
          behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns
          round, she looks away.
          PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
          just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.

                         CLIVE
          Small corrections! Small
          corrections!
          RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY

          We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the
          road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a
          taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see
          HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The
          truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the
          wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up
          suddenly, looking rattled.

          EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

          The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous
          landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE
          NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads

          "LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL
          leaps back and forth over the line.

                         PAUL
          11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock,
          12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on!
          It's fun.
          We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the
          road watching PAUL.

                         RUTH
          This is the furthest I've ever
          been.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out
          of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's
          pick up truck passes through shout; "Onward Christian
          Soldiers' blares from the radio.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs
          back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her
          Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt
          emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.

                         RUTH
          You don't mind, do you, Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          It looks nice.

                         PAUL
          Hey, we should stop for something
          to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         RUTH
          What?

                         CLIVE
          I'm hungry.

                         PAUL
          What's new, fatty?

                         CLIVE
          Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I
          happen to be very strong.
          PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits
          it onto the floor of the RV.

                         PAUL
          Pick that up then.

                         CLIVE
          So childish.

                         RUTH
          Maybe I should call Papa.

          PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE
          What?!

                         RUTH
          Look, I've been missing for a whole
          day. If he's called the police,
          they'll be looking for us and if
          they find us, this "amazing
          adventure' is going to come to an
          end real quick. I just need to tell
          him I'm fine and that I'll be back
          soon, okay?
          PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.

                         PAUL
          Right up top!
          RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.

                         PAUL
          Too soon?
          CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.

                         CLIVE
          I did it!

          EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CLIVE
          Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk
          to anyone unless you have to and
          try to look inconspicuous.
          Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.

          HOOOOOOOONNNK.

                         CLIVE
          I wish he'd stop doing that!
          They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a
          variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to
          a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.

                         RUTH
          I won't be long.

                         CLIVE
          We'll order food and wait for you
          at the bar.

                         RUTH
          Okay.

                         CLIVE
          Be careful.
          RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she
          passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each
          other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and
          CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Tap water.

          INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

          RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Ruth Behe?

                         RUTH
          Yes?

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Please hold, your call is being
          diverted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         RUTH
          Wait, I...

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Ruth Behe?

                         RUTH
          Yes?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen
          very carefully. You're in great
          danger.

                         RUTH
          How did you...?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          We know who you're travelling with
          Ruth. I need you and your friend to
          turn yourselves in.

                         RUTH
          What if we don't want to turn
          ourselves in?

          INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

          ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop
          nearby. O'REILLY listens in.

                         ZOIL
          Where are you? Where are you
          headed?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I don't know.

                         ZOIL
          Look, I know you think you're doing
          the right thing but I promise you,
          I'm only thinking about you. And
          Paul. You care about Paul, don't
          you?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I don't know how I feel about him.
          He's weird and also, rude.

                         ZOIL
          Yes he is.

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I asked him why he wore shorts and
          he said if he didn't I'd see his
          big spaceman balls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

          Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.

                         RUTH
          Who's there with you?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Ruth, please listen to me. Your
          father is worried about you. We
          want to get you home. I need you to
          tell me where you are.

                         RUTH
          He showed me things.

                         ZOIL
          You're not still talking about his
          balls, are you?

                         RUTH
          I... i just want to know what's
          real. I'm confused. I... I...
          RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)

          WE GOT HER!

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Damnit, Haggard!
          RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she
          may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into
          two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.

                         JAKE
          Hey, slow down there cyclops.

                         RUTH
          I need to get to my friends.

                         GUS
          Why the hurry? You know I got a
          friend with one eye who'd love to
          meet you.

                         RUTH
          I happen to have two eyes actually.
          I just have a severe stigmatism.

                         JAKE
          You should get that fixed up.
          Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the
          right light.

                         GUS
          Yeah, the dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RUTH
          Papa said the Lord would fix it.

                         GUS
          The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing
          sweetheart.

                         RUTH
          No shit.
          RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles
          up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.

          INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food,
          RUTH returns from the Phone.

                         GRAHAM
          How's your dad?

                         RUTH
          We need to leave now.

                         CLIVE
          We're still waiting on a wet fries.
          The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.

                         JAKE
          Holy shit! It's the space faggots
          that dinged the fuck-mobile!

                         CLIVE
          Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps
          we can exchange insurance details?

                         JAKE
          I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.

                         GUS
          These the "friends' you told us
          about, baby?

                         RUTH
          Yes, they are.

                         JAKE
          Well whaddya know? Small world.

                         RUTH
          We were just leaving.

                         GUS
          I don't think so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.

                         GRAHAM
          Leave her alone!

                         JAKE
          What did you say?

                         CLIVE
          (timid but resolute)
          He said, leave her alone.
          At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a
          tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately
          spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their
          attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM
          grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through
          the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and
          comes face to face with her father.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH?!

                         RUTH

          PAPA?!

                         CLIVE
          Graham?

                         MOSES BEHE
          I'm taking you home.

                         RUTH
          I... I can't.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Don't talk back to me, girl!

                         RUTH

                         PAPA I-
          A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
          him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.

          EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward
          the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.

                         RUTH
          What about Papa?!

                         JAKE
          Hey, we ain't finished with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CLIVE
          Graham, take Ruth into the RV and
          lock the door. I don't want either
          of you to see this.
          CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
          the face, he falls, nose bleeding.
          They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The
          MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL
          stands silhouetted against the interior lights.

                         PAUL
          Yo fucknuts!
          The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
          feet from them, their eyes bulge.

                         PAUL
          So, who wants to get probed first?
          The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.

                         GRAHAM
          Ha! Only one of us fainted!

                         PAUL
          Tell me you got the food?
          CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
          Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.

                         RUTH
          It's them.

                         GRAHAM
          Who?

                         RUTH
          It wasn't my fault. They answered
          the phone. He knew all about us.

                         CLIVE
          Who? Who are you talking about?

                         PAUL
          Get in the RV!
          SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the
          MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as
          the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks
          eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he
          doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,
          leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang
          sit in silence for a while.

                         GRAHAM
          Was that your dad, Ruth?
          RUTH nods.

                         CLIVE
          He was so angry.

                         RUTH
          He's always angry.
          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you alright, Ruth?
          RUTH nods, still distant.

                         PAUL
          I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone
          wanna take a walk?

                         CLIVE
          I'm game.

                         GRAHAM
          You want to come for a walk, Ruth?

                         RUTH
          Thanks, but I think I'm going to
          turn in. It's been a long day what
          with meeting you guys, being
          abducted by and alien and having my
          whole belief system called into
          question.

                         PAUL
          Sorry about that.

                         GRAHAM
          It was amazing though, wasn't it?
          Remember when Paul said "Yo
          fucknuts'? That was brilliant.

                         PAUL
          You gotta talk the talk, right?

                         CLIVE
          What about when I got smacked in
          the nose?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         PAUL
          Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real
          hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You
          want anything Ruth?

                         RUTH
          No, you go, I'll be fine. Here
          Clive.
          RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
          words "JESUS SAVES'.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you.
          He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.

                         GRAHAM
          You can sleep in my bunk if you'd
          like.
          She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.

                         GRAHAM
          I'd use a pen to push the tissues
          off the bed. I've had a cold.

          EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag
          of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing
          store. PAUL looks in the window.

                         PAUL
          Hey Graham. Check this out. What
          d'ya think?
          PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
          child, displayed in the window.

                         PAUL
          I'd look pretty hot, right?

                         GRAHAM
          Space cowboy.

                         PAUL
          Steve Miller Band. I love that
          song. Speaking of midnight tokers,
          I got a littler herbal refreshment
          in my pants. Do you guys partake?

                         GRAHAM
          No.

                         PAUL
          Shame. I get it from the military.
          This is the shit that killed Dylan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         GRAHAM
          Bob Dylan's still alive.

                         PAUL
          Is he?
          CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.

                         CLIVE
          Let's party!

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland
          clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking
          beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.

                         GRAHAM
          So why "Paul'? It's not very, you
          know, alien.

                         CLIVE
          Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or
          something?

                         PAUL
          No.

                         GRAHAM
          P-o-o-u-r-l?

                         PAUL
          No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or
          the little guy from Simon and
          Garfunkel.

                         CLIVE
          Paul Simon.

                         PAUL
          Paul Simon. Paul's not my real
          name. It's a name I got given.

                         GRAHAM
          What's your real name?

                         PAUL
          You won't be able to pronounce it.

                         CLIVE
          I can speak Klingon.

                         PAUL
          What a geek.

                         CLIVE
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         GRAHAM
          Come on, what's your real name.
          PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.

                         PAUL
          Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.

                         CLIVE
          Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.

                         PAUL
          That's pretty good.

                         GRAHAM
          Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.

                         PAUL
          Fuck you!

                         CLIVE
          Calm down, Rog.
          More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.

                         GRAHAM
          You look like a poster on a
          student's wall.

                         PAUL
          That was my gag! "Take me to your
          dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.
          Never saw a dime.

                         GRAHAM
          You never answered my question. Why
          Paul? Who called you Paul?

                         PAUL
          The little girl who found me when I
          crashed. It was terrible actually.
          I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
          My ship sort of landed on it. When
          the military arrived I was
          delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
          Paul?" It was the only English I
          knew, because I'd heard the little
          girl saying it over and over.
          Spooks thought it was my name.

                         CLIVE
          She called her dog Paul?

                         PAUL
          Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.

                         GRAHAM
          What happened to the little girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         PAUL
          Who knows? Never saw her again.
          Think about her everyday though.
          PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
          takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
          CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
          governed by some kind of psychic link.

                         CLIVE
          It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
          in this situation Graham and I
          would be looking up at the stars,
          wondering about life on other
          planets but we know now, don't we?
          It's a bit of an anti-climax.

                         PAUL
          Thanks a bunch, Hurley.

                         CLIVE
          I don't mean that in a bad way.
          They all scratch their noses.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul, can I ask you something?

                         PAUL
          Shoot.

                         GRAHAM
          Why are you in such a hurry to
          leave?

                         PAUL
          I've outlived my usefulness.

                         CLIVE
          How so?

                         PAUL
          There's only so much knowledge I
          can share about the universe and
          quantum theory and how to make a
          really nice meatball sandwich. The
          only thing I have to offer them now
          are my abilities.

                         GRAHAM
          So?

                         PAUL
          So the only way they're going to
          get hold of them is by obtaining
          some of somatic stem cells.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         GRAHAM
          So what, do they take a swab from
          your cheek?

                         PAUL
          Negative.

                         CLIVE
          Stool?

                         PAUL
          Sadly, not that simple.

                         GRAHAM
          Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.

                         PAUL
          Believe me, a needle would be a
          picnic compared to what they had in
          store for me.

                         CLIVE
          I don't follow.

                         PAUL
          Stem cells are multipotent.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.

                         PAUL
          Lineage defined?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          The camouflage response, the memory
          transfer, the revivification, they
          all originate in my cerebellum. In
          order to cultivate them in a
          laboratory they would have to...

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Cut your brain out.

                         PAUL
          Bingo! Fortunately, someone was
          kind enough to give me the heads
          up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,
          when they were transferring me to
          the medical facility and I noticed
          the bumper sticker on your RV, I
          figured you might be sympathetic
          types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed
          the wheel and took my chance.

                         CLIVE
          I thought the crash was our fault.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         PAUL
          Well it was, kinda.

                         GRAHAM
          So, you're saying if they catch
          you...
          PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
          at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.

                         PAUL
          So tell me, are you guys virgins or
          what?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          No.
          They all cough.

                         PAUL
          Alright then, Clive, when was the
          last time you got laid.

                         CLIVE
          Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.

                         PAUL
          Three years ago you had sex with a
          midget?

                         CLIVE
          She was an Ewok!
          Sniff.

                         PAUL
          There are only two types of person
          small enough to fit inside an Ewok
          costume.

                         CLIVE
          She was a midget.

                         PAUL
          I can't believe you thought boning
          a space bear sounded less
          embarrassing than a person of short
          stature.

                         CLIVE
          I know. I'm sorry.

                         PAUL
          Was it nice?

                         CLIVE

                         WONDERFUL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         PAUL
          You sly dog!
          PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
          beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three
          friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of
          control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.

          EXT. WOODS - MORNING

          The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the
          smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.
          His eyes open. He looks around.

                         PAUL
          Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We
          fell asleep.

                         CLIVE
          How did that happen?

                         PAUL
          Sorry, I get this thing when I get
          high. It's called "projective
          empathy'. You feel what I feel.

                         GRAHAM
          Like in E.T.?

                         PAUL
          Exactly.

                         CLIVE
          Oh, thank God. For a second there I
          thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
          The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
          Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
          town of last night has become very busy indeed.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh dear!

                         PAUL
          I can't walk through there.

                         CLIVE
          How are we going to get back?
          Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.

          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
          is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
          shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe we should hold hands, so that
          we look like a family.

                         PAUL
          That's great! Two grown men who
          look like sex offenders holding
          hands with a child cowboy.

                         CLIVE
          You could be a midget.

                         PAUL
          You're obsessed with midgets!
          They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.

                         GRAHAM
          Seem to be working, Clive. Clive?
          GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
          back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
          SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
          The tag reads "Genuine "BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.

                         GRAHAM
          Clive, no.
          CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
          behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
          the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
          and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
          scanning the passers by.

          INT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.

                         GRAHAM
          Now's not really the time, Sausage.

                         CLIVE
          I must have it.

                         GRAHAM
          It's very cheap. Are you sure you
          don't want to save up and get a
          proper on?

                         CLIVE
          Oh, come on, we've got time.

          INT/EXT. RV - DAY

          Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.

          KNOCK KNOCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         RUTH
          Where have you been? I was worried.
          She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.

                         ZOIL
          Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to
          trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret
          Service. Your wagon here matches
          the description of a recreational
          vehicle we're currently looking
          for. May I ask, are you alone?
          RUTH pauses a second.

                         RUTH
          Yes, I'm alone.

                         ZOIL
          Do you mind taking a look at these
          pictures?
          ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
          shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
          of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.

                         ZOIL
          Do you recognise any of these
          people, Miss?
          She lingers on the picture of herself.

                         ZOIL
          Miss?

                         RUTH
          No, sorry I don't.

                         ZOIL
          Where are you coming from, Ma'am?

                         RUTH
          Christian ministry in Seattle. I've
          been driving for 5 days.

                         ZOIL
          Going far?

                         RUTH
          Austin.

                         ZOIL
          Great town.

                         RUTH
          Oh yes. It has an impressive bat
          population you know?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         RUTH (CONT'D)
          Folks gather by the rive in the
          evening to watch them fly out. Turn
          the sky black. Quite a sight.

                         ZOIL
          Is that so?

                         RUTH
          Uh-huh. Well, I really should be
          getting along.

                         ZOIL
          Of course. Thanks for your time,
          Miss...?
          Beat.

                         RUTH
          Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
          ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.

          INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
          blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
          picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
          like him. The comic is called "Encounter Briefs: Tales From
          the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
          realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
          small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
          cover of the comic and back at PAUL.

                         PAUL
          How's it going?

                         CHILD
          Is that you?

                         PAUL
          No.

                         CHILD
          It looks like you.

                         PAUL
          Suppose it does. What's your name?

                         CHILD
          Keith Nash.

                         PAUL
          I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.
          They shake hands.

                         PAUL
          You on your own here, Keith Nash?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         KEITH NASH
          My Mom's shopping for some new
          jeans. She lets me wait in here.

                         PAUL
          Sounds like a good Mum.

                         KEITH NASH
          Yes and no. What're you doing here?

                         PAUL
          My friend's buying a sword. He's a
          grown man.

                         KEITH NASH
          What a nerd.
          PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.

                         PAUL
          You an M&Ms man, Keith?
          PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.

                         KEITH NASH
          I am but I shouldn't.

                         PAUL
          Strangers with candy, right?

                         KEITH NASH
          Right.

                         PAUL
          Well, we've got a lot in common. We
          both like comics and M&Ms. Guess
          that makes us pals.

                         KEITH NASH
          Guess so.
          KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their
          attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
          called "G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike
          ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.

                         PAUL
          You read this one?

                         KEITH NASH
          No.

                         PAUL
          It's a good one. Take it. Go on.
          It's a gift.

                         KEITH NASH
          Thanks Paul.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
          NASH calling from the street.

                         KEITH NASH
          I gotta go.

                         PAUL
          Catch you later, Keith Nash.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box
          under his arm and a big grin on his face.

                         CLIVE
          Who was that?

                         PAUL
          Keith Nash. How much was that?

                         CLIVE
          $299.99. It's made of a low grade
          Turkish alloy.

                         PAUL
          What did you get, speccy?

                         GRAHAM
          X-Men action figure.

                         PAUL
          Jesus Cheeeerist.

          EXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to
          KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his
          MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD
          and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.

          MRS. NASH
          Don't lie, Keith.

                         KEITH NASH
          I'm not lying.

          MRS. NASH
          Oh, come on now, Keith. If you
          carry on like this, you'll have to
          come with me to Dress Barn.

                         KEITH NASH
          Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and
          his name was Paul!

          MRS. NASH
          Whoever hard of an alien called
          Paul?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY
          stands nearby.

                         HAGGARD
          What did you say, kid?

          MRS. NASH
          Excuse me. Who are you?

                         HAGGARD
          Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret
          Service.

          MRS. NASH
          Secret Service?!

                         HAGGARD
          Kid?

                         KEITH NASH
          He was in the shop.

                         HAGGARD
          Is he still in there?
          KEITH shakes his head.

                         O'REILLY
          Did he say where he was going?
          KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the
          PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in
          the entirely wrong direction.

                         HAGGARD
          South. Toward New Mexico, huh?
          KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
          meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the
          street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.

                         O'REILLY
          We've got him man! We're going to
          get a fucking promotion.

                         HAGGARD
          You did good kid. Want a candy?

                         KEITH NASH
          No thanks.

                         HAGGARD
          Let's go.
          The two agents rush off.

                         O'REILLY
          What about Zoil?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         HAGGARD
          Screw Zoil!

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends
          down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now
          stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking
          hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up
          the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up
          is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber
          towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Where the hell do you think you're
          going?
          HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.

                         HAGGARD
          We picked up a lead, sir. Little
          kid in the town said he saw an
          alien. Said he was heading toward
          New Mexico.

                         ZOIL
          And you were just gonna take off?

                         HAGGARD
          Thought it best to take the
          initiative, sir. We were going to
          radio you.

                         ZOIL
          Well now, that's mighty civil of
          you. We have a chain of command. I
          expect you to abide by it. Where
          d'you say he was headed?

                         HAGGARD
          New Mexico sir.

                         ZOIL
          Well, then let's move it.
          They scramble.

                         ZOIL
          Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting
          ideas about your station again.
          ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY

          MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his
          hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Zoil, what the hell's going on?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          They've double back sir. They're
          heading toward New Mexico.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You better be right about this,
          Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of
          this shit. I want that little
          fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
          MOSES smiles darkly.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Looks like you're going the wrong
          way, Agent Zoil. That's what
          happens when you don't got the Lord
          on your side.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large
          roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK
          WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.

          INT. RV - DAYBREAK

          The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and
          PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is
          holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.

                         PAUL
          He likes you, y'know?

                         RUTH
          Graham? D'you think?

                         PAUL
          What are you, blind?
          Beat.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          Beat.

                         PAUL
          What you got there, a stigmatism?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          RUTH nods.

                         PAUL
          You know you can get on operation
          for that, right?

                         RUTH
          Papa said the Lord would fix it.
          Guess that's not gonna happen,
          seeing as we're living in a
          gigantic godless universe, with no
          hope of salvation.

                         PAUL
          Hey, I don't know categorically
          that it's godless. I just said
          "probably'.

                         RUTH
          Oh, that's a relief.

                         PAUL
          Look, the way you're feeling now,
          that's why religion appeared in the
          first place. It's like existential
          Prozac. Imagine being five year
          sold and having no adults around to
          tell you why it snows or what trees
          are for. That's how it is for much
          of humanity. Faith is a night-
          light. It illuminates the scary
          corners, fills the gaps, makes the
          universe easier to comprehend.
          Thing is, it's okay not to know
          everything. I mean, who knows
          what's really out there? Did you
          know astrophysicists recently
          identified the equation for the
          creation of matter?

                         RUTH
          Yes.

                         PAUL
          Oh. Well, then you get it, right?
          If they have the theory, who's to
          say at some point in the future
          they won't put it into practice and
          who's to say someone else didn't do
          that 13.5 Billion years ago and
          that's how the universe came to be?
          Course, then we get the eternal
          problem of who created the creator
          but that's a whole other car park.
          I think Shakespeare said it best.
          "There's more in Heaven and earth
          than is dreamt of in your
          philosophy Horatio".

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         RUTH
          What did you call me?

                         PAUL
          Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You
          know, the Prince of Denmark?

                         RUTH
          Denmark has a municipal population
          of 508,691.
          PAUL blinks.

                         PAUL
          Anyway, if there is a God, didn't
          he create doctors and hospitals and
          scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't
          have to go round fixing people's
          lazy eyeballs?

                         RUTH
          I suppose so.

                         PAUL
          The eye is a delicate and complex
          thing, Ruth. You should get it
          taken care of.
          RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,
          just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.

                         RUTH
          They're back.
          PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the
          RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.

                         PAUL
          Perfect.

                         CLIVE
          What are you going to do with this?

                         PAUL
          Phone home.

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY


                         VOICE

          ZOIL!
          ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.

                         ZOIL
          Yes, sir?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         VOICE
          Satellite's come up with a data
          analysis on all the traffic coming
          out of Prospect in the last 5
          hours. There was only one RV, and
          guess what, nimrod?

                         ZOIL
          It wasn't going to New Mexico?

                         VOICE
          That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.
          You better spin your ass around.
          You got some serious catching up to
          do. Don't make me come out there.

                         ZOIL
          No, sir. Where are they headed? If
          we gun it, maybe we can get the
          drop on their destination.

                         VOICE
          They're on the 50, heading towards
          Gillette.

                         ZOIL
          What else is around there?

                         VOICE
          Not much. Thunder Basis, Bethlehem
          Creek.

                         ZOIL
          Bethlehem Creek?

                         VOICE
          Holy shit!

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ZOIL's motorcade pulls a spectacular U-turn and heads back up
          the highway in the opposite direction.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAYBREAK

          MOSES listens intently to his scanner.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You don't think she's sill there,
          do you?
          MOSES smiles.

          MOSES BEHE's pick-up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn
          and heads in a different direction.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING

          Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming
          GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the
          RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene.

                         GRAHAM
          You don't think she's still there
          do you?

                         PAUL
          That's what you're going to find
          out for me.

                         CLIVE
          Us?

                         PAUL
          I can't just knock can I? What if
          she's moved on and someone else
          answers? I'm sick of people
          fainting on me. I'll hang back with
          my buddy Ruth, you two make first
          contact. Just enjoy it.

                         CLIVE
          What shall we say if it's her?
          We're here with the alien that
          killed your dog sixty years ago?

                         PAUL
          Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be
          a really big storm in exactly 34
          minutes.

                         RUTH
          How do you know?

                         PAUL
          It's my job to know.

                         CLIVE

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Leave me alone!

                         GRAHAM
          Okay.
          GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.

                         CLIVE
          Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive
          Gollings and this is my friend and
          colleague, Graham Willy. We're from
          England and we're here with the
          alien that killed your dog 60 years
          ago.
          Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to
          reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her
          eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         TARA
          What is this, some kind of joke?

                         CLIVE
          It's no joke.
          PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         PAUL
          Hello Tara.
          TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.

                         PAUL
          Aw nuts.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits
          opposite, staring at PAUL.

                         RUTH
          Maybe I should make some tea.

                         TARA
          Where are my manners? I never
          really have guests. Nobody comes up
          here. I go whole weeks without
          seeing a soul.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are
          sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.
          PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.

                         PAUL
          Can I do anything to help?
          TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
          PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.

                         TARA
          I've only just stopped believing in
          you, y'know? Spent a very long time
          trying to convince folk about what
          happened that night. My parents, my
          friends. Everyone thought I was
          mad. They told me it was a meteor
          that squashed little Paul. Took me
          away and did tests they did, said
          it was for cosmic radiation. They
          said I was concussed,
          hallucinating, but I knew you were
          real. I pulled you from that
          spaceship myself. Sat with you till
          the men came and took you away. If
          Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he
          would have seen you too. They kept
          telling me I'd imagined it but I
          knew different. Pop tried to
          understand but they filled his head
          with "delayed this' and "post-
          traumatic that'. He just used to
          smile and say "there, there Tara'.
          He got sick when I was seventeen
          and died a few years later. I
          inherited this place. Word got out
          about my story not long after it
          happened, so I didn't really have
          any friends. Kids used to throw
          stones at the house and call me
          names. I just kinda retreated into
          myself. I'd spend whole nights up
          on the roof, staring at the sky,
          hoping to catch a glimpse of you
          again. I always believed that one
          day you"d come back and here you
          are.
          The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.

                         TARA
          Listen to me gabbing. Milk and
          sugar?

                         PAUL
          I'm so sorry.

                         TARA
          What for?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         PAUL
          For killing your dog and ruining
          your life.

                         TARA
          That doesn't matter. Don't you see?
          You're real. I was right and all
          those folk that said I was crazy?
          Well, they can all go fuck
          themselves.

                         PAUL
          It's good to see you, Tara.
          The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas
          canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.

                         TARA
          Now, where do you suppose that came
          from?

                         PAUL
          Fuck a duck! Get out!

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Shit!

                         PAUL
          Tara, where's the back door?

                         TARA
          In back.
          The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door
          splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and
          continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back
          door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL
          vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand
          across ZOIL's forehead.

                         ZOIL
          Paul, wait-
          A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent
          and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap.

                         PAUL
          Clive?

                         CLIVE
          Yes?

                         PAUL
          A little help?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.

                         HAGGARD
          Freeze, space monkey!

                         GRAHAM
          We're cut off.

                         TARA
          Storm cellar!
          TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs,
          as HAGGARD fires wildly. Crockery explodes around them.

                         ZOIL
          Godammit Haggard!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. CELLAR - DAY

          The gang descend into a dim room. It is full of UFO
          paraphernalia. Models, toys, books, souvenirs from every UFO
          hot spot in the land. One the wall is the "Take Me To Your
          Dealer' poster. PAUL sees it.

                         PAUL
          Not a fucking cent.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          ZOIL comes to. He sees HAGGARD at the cellar door. Screeching
          brakes draw his attention as MOSES BEHE's truck skids up. He
          gets out, shotgun in hand.

                         ZOIL
          Oh great!

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          TEAM PAUL climb out of the cellar and start to run towards
          the RV, PAUL still in CLIVE's arms. It starts to rain.

                         PAUL
          Come on!

                         GRAHAM
          Ow, my shins!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          ZOIL sees MOSES run round to the front of the farmhouse.

                         ZOIL
          Help me up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          O'REILLY sees TEAM PAUL running toward the RV from the front
          room. He levels his pistol at PAUL and squints.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          TEAM PAUL reach the RV and start to board, just as MOSES BEHE
          lumbers into view.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH!

                         RUTH
          Papa?
          PAUL grabs RUTH's hand.

                         PAUL
          Come on.

                         MOSES BEHE
          (levelling his shotgun)
          Take your hands off her, devil!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          O'REILLY find his mark. Pull back to reveal he is stood by
          the kitchen door, through which we see the cooker, the simmer
          of gas in the air.

                         O'REILLY
          Ready or not.
          He fires.

          KA-BOOM!!!
          O'REILLY is vaporized in a ball of orange fire.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          The farmhouse explodes. ZOIL and HAGGARD who are only just
          clear, hit the deck, covering their heads. MOSES is knocked
          off his feet as flaming wood and debris rain down.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          I'll drive!

                         GRAHAM
          Punch it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE
          pulls a spectacular U-turn, sending the passengers flying.
          GRAHAM lands in TARA's arms, RUTH in PAUL's. RUTH and GRAHAM
          exchange glances. Dumb luck. TARA straightens herself and
          looks out of the RV at her destroyed home.

                         TARA
          My weed!

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder.
          His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE
          picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD
          drops ZOIL and runs to his car.

                         ZOIL
          Damnit Haggard, wait!
          HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great
          difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES
          BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder.

          INT. RV - DAY

          CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black.

                         GRAHAM
          Your dad's persistent, isn't he?

                         RUTH
          You have no idea.
          CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror.

                         CLIVE
          I think we have a problem.

                         GRAHAM
          What do we do?

                         PAUL
          Go left.

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAUL

          GO LEFT!
          CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and
          bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          HAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub.

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING


                         ZOIL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          What the hell is he doing?!

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Zoil. Progress report!

          INT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING


                         HAGGARD
          In pursuit, sir.

                         VOICE
          Who the hell is this?

                         HAGGARD
          Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been
          compromised. I'm assuming command.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Now wait a goddamn minute!

                         VOICE
          I don't give a shit who's in
          command. Where' my fucking
          mooncoon?!

                         HAGGARD
          Just ahead of me sir. We're heading
          East across scrubland just North of
          Mitchell Creek.

                         VOICE
          I don't wanna hear from either of
          you jokers until that little mother
          fucker is under glass.

                         HAGGARD
          Yes sir!
          HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining
          behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES.
          HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          They're trying to overtake.

                         PAUL
          Don't let him get past.

                         CLIVE
          Shall I ram him?

          RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL

          YES!
          CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and
          skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns
          the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes
          overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood.

          INT. RV - EVENING


                         CLIVE
          What are we doing exactly?

                         PAUL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Immense pressure and temperature
          drop. High winds, circulating in
          the troposphere, two opposed fronts
          clashing. Oh, this is going to be a
          good one.

                         CLIVE

          A GOOD WHAT?!
          RUTH stares out of the window.

                         RUTH
          Oh my God.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          A massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile
          ahead of the chase. It rakes the ground, reducing a small
          farm building to a million splinters.

          INT. RV - EVENING

          CLIVE swerves to avoid a grain silo, which comes bouncing
          across the ground toward them.

                         CLIVE
          Are you sure you know what you're
          doing?!

                         PAUL
          Twenty seconds.

                         TARA
          Paul, we'll get sucked right up.

                         PAUL
          Stay on target.
          A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.

                         CLIVE
          Paul!

                         PAUL
          Stay on target.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to
          avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL
          get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the
          wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in
          front, heading for the heart of the tornado.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH!
          HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, stand down. Stand down!

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          He's mine. I can do this!

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, it's suicide.

                         PAUL

          NOW!
          The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path
          ahead clear and oddly calm.

                         GRAHAM
          It's gone!

                         CLIVE
          Where did it go?

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          ZOIL watches amazed. He almost smiles.

                         ZOIL
          Son of a bitch!
          ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard. Wait a minute!
          An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off
          in pursuit.

                         ZOIL

          MR. BEHE!
          (into is radio)
          Damnit, hang back, hang back!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          You're not running this show any
          more Zoil. You had your chance.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, he knows what he's doing.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          So do I.

                         ZOIL
          It's a trap!

          INT. RV - EVENING


                         CLIVE
          They're still coming!

                         RUTH

          WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO?

                         PAUL
          Ruth, why don't you count back from

          10?

                         RUTH
          Okay. 10...9...

                         PAUL
          Back where I'm from, tornadoes are
          part of our daily life. We've
          learnt how to live with them, how
          to understand them.

                         CLIVE
          They're gaining!

                         PAUL
          We've learnt to anticipate their
          behavior, know their personalities,
          know when they're playing games.

                         RUTH

          3...

                         GRAHAM
          What games?

                         RUTH

          2...

                         PAUL
          Hide and seek?

                         RUTH

          1...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes
          down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD.

                         CLIVE
          Great Caesar's ghost!

                         RUTH
          How did you do that? How did you
          know?

                         PAUL
          Evolution baby.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has
          time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING

          A wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck
          round, heading back in the opposite direction.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          MOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!
          ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          We've lost them.
          TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and
          whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back.
          GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.

                         RUTH
          Wait, what about Papa?

                         CLIVE
          I only saw one car following us.

                         PAUL
          Where's Tara?
          TARA comes out of the toilet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         TARA
          The bulb's gone in there.

                         GRAHAM
          That was just awesome. Amazing
          driving Clive. It was like G.T.A.
          but potentially fatal. Wasn't it,
          Clive? Clive?
          A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.

                         CLIVE
          Oh no.

          EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING

          The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It
          whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around
          surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the
          grill, reveals the cause of her downfall.

                         GRAHAM
          There goes the deposit.

                         CLIVE
          Fare thee well friend. You were a
          faithful and mighty steed.

                         TARA
          She rode that storm with a bullet
          in her heart and didn't stop until
          we we're safe.

                         RUTH
          If there is a benevolent creator
          watching over everything then may
          he, she or it bless the 1985
          Holiday Rambler, Imperial.
          Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul?

          PAUL (O.S.)
          We're here.
          PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill.
          He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL
          climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has
          seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind...
          DEVIL's TOWER

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Of course!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING

          ZOIL drives. Scanning the landscape. Searching.

                         VOICE
          Zoil! What the hell is going on?

                         ZOIL
          We got hit by a twister, sir.
          Haggard's dead.

                         VOICE
          What about the other one?

                         ZOIL
          I lost him when the ranch exploded.

                         VOICE
          Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been
          one fuck up after another. I should
          have handled it myself. I want that
          little bastard dead by midnight
          tonight or you'll be working
          security in a convention centre.
          Now where's that RV?
          ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.

                         VOICE
          Zoil? ZOIL?
          ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER - DAY

          TEAM PAUL hike towards the tower.

                         RUTH
          What you may not know is on the
          outside of the tower they bolted a
          series of ladders, all the way to
          the top, put there by William
          Rogers in 1893. He was the first
          man to climb the tower.

                         TARA
          I climbed up there in 1976. Thought
          it would make a good site for some
          UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't
          the only one.

                         PAUL
          We call them IFOs.

                         TARA
          Cute.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         PAUL
          I-thank-you.

          EXT. SMALL ROAD - DUSK

          ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston,
          spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his
          shoulder. He sets off up the hill.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the
          corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece
          of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens
          itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.

                         PAUL
          This is it.
          PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his
          back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.

                         PAUL
          I'll miss these.
          PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the
          ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the
          cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework
          rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive
          and bright red, it illuminates the tower.

                         TARA
          Pretty.

                         GRAHAM
          What now?

                         PAUL
          We wait.
          A light appears in the sky some way off.

          PAUL (CONT'D)

                         (FROWNING)
          That was quick.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

          ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His
          face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the
          other.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          TEAM PAUL watch as the ethereal light draws nearer.
          Spotlights cut through the night, searching beneath.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

          ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees
          an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a
          deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.

                         PAUL
          Wait a minute...
          A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into
          the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by
          the sight of a torch getting nearer.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Oh shit.
          Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.

                         VOICE
          Well, whaddya know? Small world.
          VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed
          SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts
          through the trees behind them.

                         ZOIL

          PAUL!

                         PAUL
          Lorenzo?!
          PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
          bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
          bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
          bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
          past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
          ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
          shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
          leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
          cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
          shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
          holding a smoking gun.

                         VOICE
          It was you! You told him. I
          should've known.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         VOICE (CONT'D)
          You've never made a mistake in your
          life. That's why I put you in
          charge of this fucking mission.

                         ZOIL
          He's my friend! I've known him for
          twenty years. He introduced me to
          my wife damnit!

                         VOICE
          You stupid son of a bitch. In five
          years, you could have been where I
          am.

                         ZOIL
          I don't want to be where you are.

                         VOICE
          Too bad, seeing as I'm the one
          hold'ng all the cards and when I
          say "cards", I of course mean big
          fucking gun.
          VOICE points his gun at PAUL.

                         PAUL
          How'd you find me?

                         VOICE
          It was pretty easy once we got a
          fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard
          to figure out where you were
          headed. You always did have a flare
          for the dramatic.
          PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.

                         VOICE
          Let's go.
          TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
          CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.

                         CLIVE
          He's not going anywhere.

                         VOICE
          Be honest with yourself, two
          scoops. What is it that you think
          you can possibly bring to the table
          at this stage in the game?
          CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
          he holds it like a proud Samurai.

                         CLIVE
          Blind fury.
          The blade falls off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         CLIVE
          Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.

                         VOICE
          Step aside, you fat nerd.

                         CLIVE

                         (IN KLINGON)
          Graham, his this man.
          CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
          unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,
          blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.
          RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.

                         RUTH
          Leave him alone!
          VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.

                         GRAHAM
          Leave her alone!
          VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.

                         TARA
          Leave them alone.
          WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.

                         TARA
          You're not taking him away again.
          He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.

                         PAUL
          Thank you, Tara.

                         TARA
          Don't mention it.
          PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.

                         ZOIL
          The things I do for you, huh?

                         PAUL
          You know I appreciate it.

                         ZOIL
          Do you have any idea how difficult
          it was to catch you guys?

                         PAUL

                         (LAUGHS)
          Let me take a look at that. Ruth,
          shine the torch down here?
          RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.
          BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
          see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
          his eyes wide.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.

                         GRAHAM
          Noooooooooo!
          GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
          blood around her mouth.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I...I never meant to shoot her. I
          was aiming for the goblin.

                         CLIVE
          He's not a goblin he's from another
          planet.

                         MOSES BEHE
          But he can't be. He... he...

                         GRAHAM
          He's an alien you stupid man! Oh
          Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
          I should have never persuaded you
          to come with us.
          RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.

                         RUTH
          What, and miss all this? Graham,
          I've lived more in the last 48
          hours that I ever did in that
          trailer park. Isn't that what you
          said living was all about? Right
          now? This conversation? That tree?
          My next cheeseburger? I'm not
          afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
          though. Hey, where is everybody?
          RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
          buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
          with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.

                         MOSES BEHE
          What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
          sorry.
          A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
          silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.

                         PAUL
          There is no way this thing isn't
          gonna end happy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
          MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Get away from her! Don't you touch
          my little girl.
          CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
          charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
          watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
          difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
          both shining, healthy eyes.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, are you okay?

                         RUTH
          I think so. Is anyone hungry? I
          really feel like a cheese burger.
          Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
          knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
          to see PAUL.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Thank you.
          RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.

                         RUTH
          You can kiss me now.
          They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
          bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.

                         PAUL
          Looks like the geek shall inherit
          the earth.

          CLICK CLICK.
          The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.

                         VOICE
          I wouldn't say-

          SPLAT.
          A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
          shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.

                         PAUL
          Happens to the best of us.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now
          present.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.
          One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
          from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
          soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
          their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
          TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
          them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.

                         PAUL
          I'm sorry I frightened you so much
          your hair turned white.

                         RUTH
          You didn't frighten me. You freed
          me. You helped me see the light.

                         PAUL

                         (TO MOSES)
          Take care of her big man.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I will sir. God be with you.

                         PAUL
          Whatever dude.
          They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
          makeshift sling and shakes his hand.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.
          Say bye to Karen for me.

                         ZOIL
          Safe trip Short Round.
          PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
          OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.

                         CLIVE
          You can keep it.

                         PAUL
          Cool. Okay.

                         GRAHAM
          What did you think?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although
          you know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The boys nod.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Thank you.

                         GRAHAM
          No, thank you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CLIVE
          You are, and always will be, our
          friend.

                         PAUL
          Come here you fucking geeks.
          They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          This is a self-sustaining light
          orb. Might come in handy, you know,
          if a bulb goes.
          TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
          drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          You coming?

                         TARA
          What?

                         PAUL
          I ruined your life Tara. Think I
          owe you a new one.
          TARA takes PAUL's hand.

                         TARA
          I don't have my toothbrush.

                         PAUL
          Baby, where we're going, you won't
          need teeth.
          TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
          the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
          room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.
          Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.
          As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
          CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
          tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
          CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
          ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.

                         GRAHAM
          That was good, wasn't it?

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

          We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a
          long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE.
          They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short
          woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks
          away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.
          A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own
          rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The
          PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.

                         PUBLICIST
          Just one item per person please.
          He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is
          dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in
          which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.

                         RUTH
          Hey.

                         GRAHAM
          Hey babe. You okay?

                         RUTH
          I'm just taking Tara over to the
          autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's
          here!

                         CLIVE
          Oh, say hi from us, won't you?
          RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach.

                         MAJOR NERD 1
          Uh... were you... did you?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          There you go.

          SECURITY MAN (O.S.)
          Next in line please.

                         MAJOR NERD 2
          Uh... were you... did you?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          There you go.

                         SECURITY MAN
          Guys, if you've had your book
          signed please move on.
          Tilt up to reveal the security man. It is none other than
          former Special Agent LORENZO ZOIL. CRANE up to reveal the
          whole convention floor.




                                   THE END
FADE IN:

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

A gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the
FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo,
almost under her breath.

                     YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life
           for me...

Suddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the Winged
Victory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought,
the H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-five
gun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

ELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow
railing, gazing at the seas, still singing --

                     ELIZABETH
           ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...

JOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather,
clutches her shoulder, startling her.

                     GIBBS
               (sotto)
           Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail
           these waters. You want to call
           'em down on us?

Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him.

                        NORRINGTON
           Mr. Gibbs.

NORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core,
glares sternly at Gibbs. Standing besides him is GOVERNOR
WEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brass
buttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth's
father.

                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
           That will do.

                    GIBBS
          She was singing about pirates.
          Bad luck to sing about pirates,
          with us mired in this unnatural
          fog-- mark my words.

                    NORRINGTON
          Consider them marked.   On your
          way.

                    GIBBS
          'Aye, Captain.
              (as he moves off)
          Bad luck to have a woman on board,
          too. Even a mini'ture one.

He returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiously
takes a quick swig from flask.

                    ELIZABETH
          I think it would be rather
          exciting to meet a pirate.

                    NORRINGTON
          Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and
          dissolute creatures, the  lot of
          them. I intend to see to   it that
          any man who sails under a  pirate
          flag, or wears a pirates  brand,
          gets what he deserves: a  short
          drop and a sudden stop.

Elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden
stop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.

                    SWAN
          Captain Norrington... I appreciate
          your fervor, but I am concerned about
          the effect this subject will have on
          my daughter.

                    NORRINGTON
          My apologies, Governor.

                    ELIZABETH
          Actually, I find it all fascinating.

                    SWAN

          And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth,
          dear... we will be landing in Port
          Royal very soon, and beginning our new
          lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
          comport ourselves as befits our class
          and station?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, father.

Chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (to herself)
          I still think it would be exciting
          to meet a pirate...

The fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is
visible --

-- but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy,
WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty
water. There is nothing to show where he came from, or how
he came to be there.

                     ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Look!   A boy! In the water!

Norrington and Swann spot him --

                    NORRINGTON
          Man overboard!

                    ELIZABETH
          Boy overboard!

                    NORRINGTON
          Fetch a hook! Haul him out of
          there!

Quick movement and activity on the deck. Sailors use a
boathook to snag the boy he the passes. Norrington and
Swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabeth
sidles in for a closer look.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          He's still breathing.

                     SWAN

          Where did he come from?

                    GIBBS
          Mary mother of God ...

Attention is turned away from the boy --

The sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters
the water... along with the bodies of its crew. What is
left of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag
hanging limply from the stern.

The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all.   The
scene calls for hushed voices.

                    SWAN
          What happened here?

                    NORRINGTON
          An explosion in the powder magazine.
          Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

                    GIBBS
          Lot of good it did them...
              (off Swan's look)
          Everyone's thinking it! I'm just
          saying it! Pirates!

                    SWAN
          There is no proof of that. It could
          have been an accident. Captain, these
          men were protection. If there is even
          the slightest chance one of those poor
          devils is still alive, we cannot
          abandon them!

                     NORRINGTON
          Of course not, Governor.
              (to the crew)
          Come about and strike the sails! Unlash
          the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off
          the cannons!
              (to Swann)
          Hope for the best...prepare for
          the worst.
              (to two sailors)
          Move the boy aft. We'll need the
          deck clear.

They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the
rail, away from the hideous scene in the water.

                    SWAN
          Elizabeth, I want you to accompany
          the boy. He's in your charge now.
          You'll watch over him?

Elizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstow
the longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop
deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. Elizabeth kneels
down besides the boy.

His good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out,
gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --

Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth is
startled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.

                    ELIZABETH
          My name is Elizabeth Swann.

                    WILL
          Will Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          I'm watching over you, Will.

He clutches her hands, then slips back into
unconsciousness.

His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth
sees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free,
revealing--

A GOLD MEDALLION.   One side is blank.   She turns it over --

A SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but to
her eyes, it means one thing only:

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You're a pirate.

She glances back at the crew.   Sees Norrington, giving
orders, moving toward her.

She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takes
the medallion from around his neck. Hides it under her
coat.

Norrington arrives.

                    NORRINGTON
          Did he speak?

                    ELIZABETH
          His name is Will Turner -- that's
          all I found out.

                       NORRINGTON
          Very good.

Norrington hurries off. Elizabeth steals away to the stern
of the ship. Examines her prize -- the gold medallion. A
wisp of wind, and she looks up --

Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a
ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --

It has BLACK SAILS.

Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.

The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not
the mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skull
and crossbones of the Jolly Roger.

Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on
the flag is the same as the one on the medallion.

Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for
the black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to
TURN and GRIN at her --

Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --

                       EIGHT YEARS LATER

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM

-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.

But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on
the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old
Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.

She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a
nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)

Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as
possible without moving. Might there be someone in the
room with her, looming over her?

She turns, ready for anything.   She is alone.

Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp
besides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the
room to a dressing table, sits down.

She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches
into a space beneath it and removes --

The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not
lost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it
as she absently returns the draw to its place --

A BOOMING knock on the door;    Elizabeth jumps up, startled
knocking over her chair.

                    SWANN (O.S.)
          Elizabeth? Is everything all
          right? Are you decent?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes -- yes.

She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as
Swann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid,
ESTRELLA, follows.

                    SWANN
          Still abed at this hour?    It's a
          beautiful day!

Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:

Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL,
built on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of the
harbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with
cannon.

                    SWANN (CONT'D)
          I have a gift for you.

He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet
dress. She lets out an admiring gasp.

                    ELIZABETH

          It's -- beautiful. May I inquire
          as to the occasion?

                    SWANN
          Is an occasion necessary for a father
          to dote upon his daughter with gifts?

Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened-
off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.

                    SWANN (CONT'D)
          Although...I did think you could
          wear it to the ceremony today.

                       ELIZABETH (O.S.)
          Ceremony?

                    SWANN
          Captain Norrington's promotion
          ceremony.

Elizabeth peeks around the screen.

                       ELIZABETH
          I knew it.

                    SWANN
          Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a
          fine gentleman, don't you think?
              (no answer)
          He fancies you, you know.

Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.

                       SWANN (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth?     How's it coming?

ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and      the medallion (still
around her neck) out of the way as the      maid cinches her
into a corset over her slip. Estrella       has her foot in
Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces      tight.

                    ELIZABETH
          Difficult ... to say.

                    SWANN (O.S.)
          I'm told that dress is the very latest
          fashion in London.

                    ELIZABETH
              (holding her breath)
          Women in London must have learned to
          not breath.

Estrella is finished.   Elizabeth takes a breath -- and
winces.

A butler appears in the doorway of the room.

                    BUTLER
          Governor? A caller is here for
          you.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAY

The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer,
looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long
presentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on
the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.

                     SWANN
          Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see
          you again!

The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a
watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.

                    WILL
          Good day, sir.
              (holds out the case)
          I have your order.

Swann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a
beautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out
reverently.

                    WILL (CONT'D)

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          The blade is folded steel. That's
          gold filigree laid into the
          handle. If I may -

He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one
finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.

                    WILL (CONT'D)

          Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly
          the full width of the blade..

                    SWANN
          Impressive. .. very impressive.
          Commodore Norrington will be pleased,
          I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to
          your master.

Will's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is
proud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword
around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.

                    WILL
              (bows slightly)
          I shall. A craftsman is always pleased
          to hear his work is appreciated --

He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann -

Elizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be
painful to wear, but holy smokes!

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth! You look stunning!

Will tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to
himself, and simply nods emphatically.

                    ELIZABETH
          Will! It's so good to see you!

Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion
is hidden in the bodice of her dress).

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I dreamt about you last night.
          Will reacts with surprise:
          "Really?

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth, this is hardly
          appropriate -

                    ELIZABETH
              (ignores her father)
          About the day we met. Do you
          remember?

                    WILL
          I could never forget it, Miss
          Swann.

                    ELIZABETH
          Will, how many times must I ask
          you to call me 'Elizabeth'?

                    WILL
          At least once more, Miss Swann. As
          always.

Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his
response.

                    SWANN
          Well said! There's a boy who
          understands propriety. Now, we must be
          going.

Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for
Elizabeth.

Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and
strides past Will.

                    ELIZABETH
          Good day, Mr. Turner.

EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

Swann follows Elizabeth out the door.

                      WILL
          Good day.

He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the
driver.

                     WILL (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          Elizabeth.

IN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.

                    SWANN
          Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit
          more decorum in front of Commodore
          Norrington. After all, it is only

          through his efforts that Port Royal has
          become at all civilized.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY

The skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in
buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky
promontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a
sign:

PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.

The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of
them. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in
the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling
rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.

He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a
tankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his
attention. He jumps from the rigging -

-- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an
imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a
single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.

And it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.

Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to
control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the
promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.

The huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates
the bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the
H.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and
a mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at
the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort
Charles.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY

Smoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the
sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. The
HARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there
to catch a line and help Jack tie up.

                    HARBORMASTER
          If you're out rolling scuppers in
          this tub, you're either incredibly
          brave or incredibly stupid.

                    JACK
          It's remarkable how often those
          two traits coincide.

He starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides
the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small
powder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off.

                    HARBORMASTER
          It's a shilling for the dock
          space, and you're going to have to
          give me your name.

                    JACK
          What do you say to three
          shillings, and we forget the name?

He tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster
considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.

                    HARBORMASTER
          Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks across
the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above the
Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony
is underway -

EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY

With choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and
scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed
Navy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it
out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.

Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and
Swann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the
sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann
steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps
back.

Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow
officers, turns again and nods to the audience -
dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.
Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.

The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from
the Navy men.

In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out
beneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces.
Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material
of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her
discomfort.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAY

Two sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, take
advantage of what little shade there is on the dock. But
when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.

                     MURTOGG
          This dock is off-limits to
          civilians.

                    JACK
          Sorry, I didn't know.

Music drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shields
his eyes.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?
          You two weren't invited?

                     MURTOGG
          No ... someone has to make sure
          this dock stays off-limits to
          civilians.

                    JACK
          This must be some important boat.

                       MULLROY
          Ship.

                       JACK
          Ship.

                    MURTOGG
          Captain Norrington's made it his
          flagship. He'll use it to hunt
          down the last dregs of piracy on
          the Spanish Lake.

                       MULLROY
          Commodore.

                    MURTOGG
          Right. Commodore Norrington.

                    JACK
          That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it
          seems to me a ship like that --
              (indicates the Dauntless)
          -- makes this one here just a wee
          superfluous.

                    MURTOGG
          Oh, the Dauntless is the power in
          these waters, true enough -- but
          there's no ship that can match the
          Interceptor for speed.

                    JACK
          That so? I've heard of one, supposed to
          be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black
          Pearl?

Mullroy scoffs at the name.

                    MULLR0Y
          There's no real ship as can match
          the Interceptor.

                    MURTOGG
          The Black Pearl is a real ship.

                    MULLROY
          No, it's not.

                    MURTOGG
          Yes it is. I've seen it.

                    MULLR0Y
          You've seen it?

                    MURTOGG
          Yes.

                    MULLROY
          You've seen the Black Pearl?

                    MURTOGG
          Yes.

                    MULLR0Y

          You haven't seen it.

                    MURTOGG
          Yes, I have.

                    MULLR0Y
          You've seen a ship with black sails
          that's crewed by the damned and
          captained by a man so evil that hell
          itself spat him back out?

                     MURTOGG
          ... No .

                     MULLROY
          No.

                    MURTOGG
          But I've seen a ship with black sails.

                    MULLR0Y
          Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by
          the damned and captained by a man so
          evil hell itself spat him back out
          could possibly have black sails and
          therefore couldn't possibly be any ship
          other than the Black Pearl. Is that
          what you're saying?

                     MURTOGG
          ... no.

                    MULLR0Y
              (turns back to Jack)
          Like I said, there's no real ship
          as can match -- Hey!

But Jack's not there. Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot
-

Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually
examining the mechanism.

                     MULLROY (CONT'D)
          You!

Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. The
sailors hurry toward the gangplank.

                    MULLROY (CONT'D)
          Get away from there! You don't
          have permission to be aboard
          there!

Jack spreads his hands in apology.

                    JACK
          I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty
          boat. Ship.

The sailors study him suspiciously.

                    MURTOGG
          What's your name?

                       JACK
          Smith.

                    MULLR0Y
          What's your business in Port
          Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?

                    MURTOGG
          And no lies!

                    JACK
          None? Very well. You've rumbled
          me. I confess: I intend to
          commandeer one of these ships,
          pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go
          out on the account, do a little
          honest pirating.

                    MURTOGG
          I said, no lies.

                    MULLR0Y
          I think he's telling the truth.

                    MURTOGG
          He's not telling the truth.

                       MULLROY
          He may be.

                    MURTOGG
          If he were telling the truth he
          wouldn't have told us.

                    JACK
          Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
          believe the truth if he told it to you.

Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --

EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY

Elizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly,
oblivious to the music and chatter.

                    NORRINGTON
          May I have a moment?

He extends his arm. She takes it. He walks her away from
the party, toward the parapet. A rather too long of a
silence as Norrington works up his courage.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
              (a burst)
          You look lovely. Elizabeth.

Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus. Norrington mistakes her
expression as disapproval.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I apologize if I seem forward --
          but I must speak my mind.


                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
              (working up his
               confidence to do so)
          This promotion confirms that I have
          accomplished the goals I set for myself
          in my career. But it also casts into
          sharp relief that which I have not
          achieved. The thing all men most
          require: a marriage to a fine woman.
              (beat)
          You have become a fine woman,
          Elizabeth.

                    ELIZABETH
          I can't breathe.

                    NORRINGTON
              (smiles)

          I'm a bit nervous, myself --

Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington.
She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself,
but it slides off -

-- and then she vanishes over the wall. Gone.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth! .

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see -

Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff. It seems to
take her a long time to reach the sea --

Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks.
A wave breaks, and then she is washed out away from the
cliff, struggling feebly.

AT THE FORT, Norrington looks down --

NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!

He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive -- a
lieutenant, GILLETTE catches his arm.

                    GILLETTE
          The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she
          missed them!

Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down -- and realizes
Gillette is right. He jumps down and runs --

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the
sight.

                    JACK
          Aren't you going to save her?

                    MULLR0Y
          I can't swim.

Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he.

                    JACK
              (rolls his eyes)
          Sailors.

Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water. Norrington
and several other men pick their way down the cliffs. They
are too far away to get to her in time.

Jack scowls. He has no choice -- and it pisses him off.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Fine.

He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg;
then hands the belt to Mullroy.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Don't lose these.

And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth.

Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air '-
then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged -

UNDERWATER, Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious. The current
turns her, and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice.

The MEDALLION turns slowly, until the SKULL is fully
visible. A shaft of filtered sunlight hits it, and it
GLINTS -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAY

FORT CHARLES: The British flag flies, blown from an
offshore breeze. Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goes
limp.

ON THE DOCKS: Wood and metal fittings on lines bang against
masts. The wind dies, and there is silence.

ON THE EDGE OF TOWN: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking
chickens, frowns when they all suddenly go quiet ...

IN THE VILLAGE: A weather vane moves slightly in the wind.
The wind stops, and all is still. And then ...

... the weather vane TURNS, and holds steady -- the wind
has picked up again, but now blows .from the sea toward the
land.

l)ON THE BEACH: an OLD SALT pulls a rope line, pauses.
Turns and gazes to the sky, frowning. The mangy hound at
his side starts BARKING incessantly -

ON THE DOCKS: The lines bang against the other sides of the
masts, the wind far stronger now.

FORT CHARLES: the British flag flies in the opposite
direction, snapping in the new onshore breeze.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - CLIFFSIDE - DAY

Norrington rushes down, intent on the climb. Beyond him,
past the rocky point, far out to sea, FOG gathers -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAY

UNDERWATER: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmoving
form - - and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around her
and makes for the surface.

ON THE SURFACE, Jack swims toward the dock, struggling. It
is .: far more difficult than it should be. He stops
stroking, and they submerge.

UNDERWATER: Jack realizes that   it is Elizabeth's heavy
velvet dress that is weighing   them down. He pulls at the
buttons on the back, and they   give way. He skins her out of
the dress, and kicks away from   it.

The dress falls like a cloud into darkness -

ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more
quickly.

AT THE DOCK, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul
Elizabeth out of the water.

Jack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth is on her back;
Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them.
Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth.

                    MULLROY
          Not breathing.

Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless. Jack steps up,
drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath.

                    JACK

          Move.

He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the
knife -- Murtogg is shocked -

Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away.

Elizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up water
and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is
relieved.

                    MULLROY
          I never would have thought of
          that.

                     JACK
          Clearly, you've never been to
          Singapore.

Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -
and that's when he spots -

The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his "hand.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Where did you get this?

Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at
Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in
fact, looking bright and sharp.

                    NORRINGTON
          On your feet.

It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her
clothes gone. He gets to his feet. The rest of Elizabeth's
erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann.

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth! Are you all right?

He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her.

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore
          Norrington, do you intend to kill
          my rescuer?

Norrington looks at Jack. Jack nods as best he can with a
blade beneath his chin. Norrington sheathes his sword, and
extends his hand.

                    NORRINGTON
          I believe thanks are in order.

Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly. They shake -

-- and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm
toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt -

-- exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.'

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Had a brush-up with the East India
          Trading Company, did you ... pirate?

The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained
--in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack. He
stands there, still holding the corset.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette,
          fetch some irons.

Norrington notices something else -- below the 'P' brand is
a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

                    JACK
          Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.

Norrington looks out at the bay.

                    NORRINGTON
          I don't see your ship -- Captain.

                    MURTOGG
          He said he'd come to commandeer one.

                    MULLROY
              (to Murtogg)
          I told you he was telling the truth.
              (currying favor)
          These are his, sir.

He holds out Jack's pistol and belt. Norrington takes the
pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt.

                    NORRINGTON
              (to Jack)
          Extra powder, but no additional shot.

Jack shrugs. Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt,
opens it. He frowns at the reading. Moves the compass this
way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          It doesn't bear true.

Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns the
compass to the belt. Draws the sword half from the
scabbard.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I half-expected it to be made of wood.

He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Taking stock: you've got a pistol with
          only one shot, a compass that doesn't
          point north ... and no ship. You are
          without a doubt the worst pirate I have
          ever heard of.

                    JACK
          Ah, but you have heard of me.

Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack.

                    NORRINGTON
          Carefully, lieutenant.

Elizabeth steps forward. Swann's jacket slips off her. She
is unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or
          not, this man saved my life.

                    NORRINGTON
          One good deed is not enough to redeem a
          man of a lifetime of wickedness.

Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists.

                    JACK
          But it seems to be enough to condemn
          him.

                    NORRINGTON
              (smiles)
          Indeed.

Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to his
men. All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward -

                       JACK
          Finally.

Lightning-quick, he snaps the   corset  around the hand and
wrist of the man holding the   pistol  and yanks. The pistol
sails into the water. Before   anyone  can react to that, Jack
has the manacle chain wrapped   around  Elizabeth's throat.

Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a
shield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (backing away, toward land)
          Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and
          belt, please.

Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Commodore!

Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norrington
holds them out to Jack.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?

Elizabeth is more angry than frightened.

ELIZABETH Miss Swann.

                    JACK
          Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?

She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's
quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. He
jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Now, if you'll be very kind?

She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.

                    ELIZABETH
              (as she works)
          You are despicable.

                    JACK
          I saved your life; now you've
          saved mine. We're square.

Done. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps
against the cargo gantry.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will
          always remember this as the day
          you almost caught Captain Jack
          Sparrow.

He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a
belaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up
to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope -

Pistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, away
and around from the gantry.

Norrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracks
Jack's trajectory-

Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shot
tears the rope -

-- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he
snaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs
hold of the far loop -- slides down the line -

-- drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to another
ship, then out of sight -

                    NORRINGTON
          On his heels! Gillette, bring a
          squad down from the fort!

              (to Elizabeth)
          Elizabeth, are you -

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go
          capture him.

Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries
away. Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.

                    SWANN
          Here, dear ... you should wear this.

Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold.
Glances out at the bay -

-- where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water. She
takes the jacket.

                    ELIZABETH
          Thank you, Father ... and let that
          be the last of your fashion
          advice, please.

But she accepts his comforting embrace.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY

The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. An
armed search party moves along the street. They glance down
an alley-

On the far side is another search party. The men nod to
each other, continue on.

A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath
the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles.

Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru
door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY

Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around:

No windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in-
progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron
gates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But every
tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat.

Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a
blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a
bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,
turns away.

Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled
sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing
coke furnace in the middle of the room.

Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the
chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack
sweats, grimaces at the pain -

Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an
anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on
the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,
plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam
billows.

Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath
the manacle -- but his hands are free.

The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.

Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the
drunken Mister Brown in the corner.

                    WILL
          Right where I left you.

Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The
sledge lying beside the anvil.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
              (under his breath)
          Not where I left you.

He moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it --
but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps
back.

Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up,
toward the door. Will glares at him.

                    WILL (CONT' D)
              (voice low and tight)
          You're the one they're hunting.
          The pirate.

Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then
frowns, regards Will.

                    JACK
          You look familiar ... Have I ever
          threatened you before?

                    WILL
          I've made a point of avoiding
          familiarity with pirates.

                    JACK
          Ah. Then it would be a shame to
          put a black mark on your record.
          So if you'll excuse me ...

Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in
the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it
in hand.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Do you think this is wise, boy?
          Crossing blades with a pirate?

                    WILL
          You threatened Miss Swann.

                    JACK
          Only a little.

In response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack
appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.

Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading
feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost
impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          You know what you're doing, I'll
          give you that ... Excellent form
          ... But how's your footwork? If I
          step here -

He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the
other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Very good! And if I step again,
          you step again. . .

              (continuing to step
               around the circle)
          And so we circle, circle, like
          dogs we circle. . .

They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Ta!

Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.

Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious
overhand motion, he throws his sword -

-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the
latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls
on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the
way.

Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it
is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he
turns back to Will, he's smiling.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          That's a good trick. Except, once
          again, you are between me and the
          way out.
              (points his sword at the
               back door)
          And now you have no weapon.

Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an
anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward.

Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly,
Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at
Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.

Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming
him.

Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware
that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords,
knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Who makes all these?

                    WILL
          I do. And I practice with them. At
          least three hours a day.

                    JACK
          You need to find yourself a girl.
              (Will sets his jaw)
          Or maybe the reason you practice
          three hours a day is you've found
          one -- but can't get her?

A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with
anger.

                    WILL
          No. I practice three hours a day
          so that when I meet a pirate ... I
          can kill him.

He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his
hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the
air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.

Jack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps
around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard
through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -

So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the
ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and
dodging around the furnace -

Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS
into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up,
kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.

Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the
ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second,
hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls
down, gets up -

Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.

Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit.
Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          You cheated.

                    JACK

              (smiles; what do you expect?)
          Pirate.

Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the
door.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Move away.

                       WILL
          No.

                       JACK
          Move!

                    WILL
          No. I can not just step aside and
          let you escape.

Jack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off
lasts for a long moment.

                    JACK
          You're lucky, boy -- this shot's
          not meant for you.

Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack
-

Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's
skull. Jack crumples to the ground.

The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the
room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.

                    NORRINGTON
          Excellent work, Mister Brown.
          You've aided in the capture of a
          dangerous fugitive.

                    BROWN
          Just doing my civic duty.

Jack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.

                    NORRINGTON
          I believe you will always remember
          this as the day Captain Jack
          Sparrow almost escaped.

Norrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go.
Brown looks at his bottle -- broken.

                    BROWN
          That ratter broke my bottle.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

The thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town.

The only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the

bluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey.

Above the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A
waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow.

ANGLE - FORT CHARLES,

just below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly
deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the
water: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying
from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull.

The Black Pearl has come to Port Royal.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it
between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed.

                     ELIZABETH
          Nice and toasty. Thank you,
          Estrellia.

The maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins
reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around
her neck.

The lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn
it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron
ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops.

His attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter
and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing,

he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it
down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his
mouth.

Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their
cell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a
bone. The dog just sits and cocks its head.

                    PRISONER
          Come here, boy... Want a nice,
          juicy bone?

In an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw.

                    JACK
          You can keep doing that forever,
          that dog's never going to move.

                    PRISONER
          Excuse us if we ain't resigned
          ourselves to the gallows just yet.

EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

A noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard. Norrington
and Swann walk along the far wall.

                    SWANN
          Has my daughter given you an
          answer yet?

                    NORRINGTON
          No. She hasn't.

                    SWANN
          Well, she had a taxing day...
          Ghastly weather tonight.

                    NORRINGTON
          Bleak. Very bleak.

From the distance, there is a BOOM -

                    SWANN
          What was that?

-- and then the WHISTLE of an incoming ball --

                    NORRINGTON
          Cannon fire!

He tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet EXPLODES --

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

Jack sits up. There are more BOOMS -

                    JACK
          I know those guns!

He peers out through the bars of the window. The other
prisoners crowd around their window as well.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          It's the Black Pearl.

                     PRISONER
              (frightened)
          The Black Pearl? I've heard
          stories ... she's been preying on
          ships and settlements for near ten
          years ... and never leaves any
          survivors.

                    JACK
          There are a lot of stories about
          the Black Pearl.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - NIGHT

The Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights
up around her with each boom of her guns. She's firing on
both sides now, hammering both the fort and the town.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - NIGHT

Streets, buildings, docks and ships shatter and explode
beneath the onslaught. Villagers panic, run for cover,
dodge flying debris as best they can. If this is not hell
on earth, then it's about to be --

-- long boats emerge out of the fog, carrying ARMED
PIRATES. They swarm from the boats, striking down
,villagers indiscriminately and setting fires.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of
his back. He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a
third. He picks up a second axe and a sword.

Will slides back the doors of the forge --

A woman runs past, chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a
yellow bandeau. Will backhands the axe square into his
chest, a deadly blow. Will heads out, up the street --

EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

The moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning
gallows and wooden roofs. Cannon fire continues to rain
down, but the fort's own cannons now return fire.

                    NORRINGTON
          Governor! Barricade yourself in my
          office!
              (Swann hesitates)
          That's an order!

Swann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a
pirate -- KOEHLER, a handsome blond man with gold earrings.
Beyond Koehler, more pirates come up over the far wall.
Koehler grins and raises a cutlass -

-- Norrington's sword blocks Koehler's slash.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          They've flanked us! Men! Swords
          and pistols!

The battle is joined --

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH f S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even
through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn
in the harbor. Shouts and cries of pain. Cannon fire
ECHOES.

She notices movement directly below her window: two SHADOWY
FIGURES, approaching the house -- pirates. Elizabeth bolts
from her room--

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries
out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there
is the BOOM of a gun, and the butler crumples.

Elizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the
balusters. The pirates scan the foyer, searching. The
leader is PINTEL, a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head.

Suddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth.
How could he know she was there?

                      PINTEL
          Up there!

The pirates rush for the stairs. Elizabeth scrambles back
into the nearest room--

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth shuts the door, locks it, listens as the pirates
pound up the stairs --

                    ESTRELLA
          Miss Elizabeth?

Elizabeth jumps. Estrella is right behind her, terrified.
They whisper:

                    ESTRELLA (CONT'D)
          Are they come to kidnap you, miss?
          The daughter of the governor would
          be very valuable.

Elizabeth realizes she's right. There is the SLAM of a body
against the door.

                    ELIZABETH
          Listen, Estrella -- they haven't
          seen you. Hide, and first chance,
          run for the fort .

Estrella nods. Another SLAM at the door -- it gives a bit -
-

Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner, between a tall
wardrobe and the wall. Dashes for the side door.

When the door smashes inward, it slams into the wardrobe,
and the maid cannot be seen. The pirates run in -- spot the
open side door, and run for it --

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pintel is the first through, and gets the pan of the bed
warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back,
holding his nose --

INT. SITIING ROOM - NIGHT

Estrella breaks cover, runs for the hall, unnoticed.

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate,
but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth can't jerk it
free, so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down,
BANGING the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head,
sizzling.

Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs -

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY/FOYER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the
stairs, but the second pirate vaults the handrail --

Estrella registers the butler's body, but continues out the
still-open front door at a dead run. Elizabeth follows --

The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front
door. His face is BURNED, his hair SMOLDERS -- he reaches -
-

Elizabeth pulls up short, runs the other way --

Pintel, on the stairs, grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth

doesn't slow -- she spins, grabs Pintel's arm with both
hands and pulls him hard, belly-first, into the cap of the
newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps
going

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth slams the double doors shut, throws the bolts.
The interior shutters are closed over the windows. Above
the fireplace are two crossed swords.

Elizabeth climbs on the firebox; she grabs one of the
swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it won't come free.
Both swords are securely attached to the wall. Damn!

A SMASH from the doors -- the pirates are relentless -

On the table is a platter with fruit, cheese and bread.
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter -

Like any bread knife, it has a round point. Elizabeth jabs
it into her palm -- it's useless as a weapon. Double damn!

The blade of a boarding axe breaches the door -- the
pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around -

INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

The doors give way; the pirates charge through -

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Empty. Elizabeth nowhere to be seen. Pintel and Smoldering
Pirate search, under the table, behind draperies.

                    PINTEL
          We know you're here, poppet. Come
          out and we promise we won't hurt
          you.

Smoldering pirate gives him look -- he wants to hurt her
plenty. Pintel shakes his head: 'Don't worry, I'm lying.'

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          We will find you, poppet ...
          You've got something of ours, and
          it calls to us!

INT. DUMBWAITER - NIGHT

Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box, wrapped around the
double pulley ropes that go through the center.

                    PINTEL (O.S.)
          The gold calls to us!

Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion,
rubs

the gold with her thumb. This is their objective. Light

spills into the- box through gaps in the top as the door
above is slid open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps -

Pintel leers down at her.

                      PINTEL (CONT'D)
            Hello, poppet.

Elizabeth works the ropes to lower  the box. Pintel pulls
the other way; he's stronger, and  the box rises. Elizabeth
tries to stop it -- wraps her left  forearm through the rope
and lets it jam against the top of  the box.

Elizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops. She saws at
the rope with the bread knife.

Smoldering pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's
forearm. Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing -

The rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS -

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH, and a
cloud of dust. The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers
out. Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can
barely stand. She leans over the table, trying to recover.

The sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ...

                      ELIZABETH
            Please, no ...

Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a
desperate idea occurs to her.

The pirates burst through the door. Elizabeth backs away,
holds the bread knife out to ward them off. They come
around either side of the table, stalking her -

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                (gasps it out)
            Par. .. Parlay!

Pintel can't believe his ears.

                    PINTEL
          What?

                    ELIZABETH
          Parlay! I invoke the right of
          parlay! According to" the Code of
          the Brethren, set down by the
          pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,
          you must take me to your Captain!

                    PINTEL
          I know the code.

                    ELIZABETH
          If an adversary demands parley,
          you can do them no harm until the
          parlay is complete.

                    PINTEL
          It would appear, so do you.

                    SMOLDERING PIRATE
          To blazes with the code!

He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him.

                    PINTEL
          She wants to be taken to the
          Captain, and she'll go without a
          fuss.

He looks to Elizabeth: 'right?' Elizabeth nods.

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          We must honor the code.

Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. He
grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - NIGHT

Will races along, momentarily free of the pirates. He spots
the Governor's Mansion in the distance. There are FIGURES
moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two
pirates.

Will hurries forward -

Suddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will
defends himself. The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow
bandana. Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy?

The hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging
a flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind. Will
crumples.

The pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they
hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go.

On the ground, Will doesn't move.

INT. FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself
out from under rubble. Moonlight spills in through the
gaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom.

But it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's
cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.

                       PRISIONER
          Praise be!

He and the other two scramble through.

                    PRISONER (CONT'D)
              (back to Jack)
          My sympathies, friend - - you've
          no manner of luck at all!

The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.

Jack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits
shaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key
ring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks
up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog
forward.

                    JACK
          It's all right, doggie ... come
          here,

boy. Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido?

To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.
Jack continues to coax him closer.

The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the
dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He
BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What's the matter, boy?

The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out
through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him.

The door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates
step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG.

                    TWIGG
          This isn't the armory.

He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack.

                    KOEHLER
              (Dutch accent)
          Well, well... Look what we have
          here, Twigg. It's. Captain
          Sparrow.

                    TWIGG
          Huh. Last time I saw you, you were
          all alone on a God-forsaken
          island, shrinking into the
          distance. I'd heard you'd gotten
          off, but I didn't believe it.

                    KOEHLER
          Did you sprout little wings and
          flyaway?

                    TWIGG
          His fortunes aren't improved much.

The two laugh. Jack doesn't. He steps forward, close to the
bars. This puts him in a spill of moonlight. He is tight
with fury.

                    JACK
          Worry about your own fortunes. The
          lowest circle of hell is reserved
          for betrayers ... and mutineers.

Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that. Koehler lashes
out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars. Jack
clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down -

Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands
are skeletal.

Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          You are cursed.

Koehler sneers, shoves Jack backwards, hard. Now out of the
moonlight, his hand is normal. Jack stares, realizing -

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          The stories are true.

Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door. Looks back.

                    KOEHLER
          You know nothing of hell.

And then they're gone.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

Amid the thunder of cannon fire, a longboat slips through
the fog. Elizabeth sits in the prow. Columns of water from
cannon balls geyser up around the boat.

The fog parts. Elizabeth looks up to see --

The Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming
high above her. At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead
of a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking
wing from her outstretched hand.

The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a
winch.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog. Smoke
hangs heavy above the deck.

Elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail --
pirates spot her, and stare. One polite fellow steps

forward to offer his hand. She takes it and steps down. She
huddles, self-conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe.

                    BOSUN
          I didn't know we was taking
          captives.

                    PINTEL
          She's invoked the right of
          parlay... with Captain Barbossa.

ON THE POOP DECK -- an imposing FIGURE in silhouette stands
by the wheel, too far away to have heard Pintel's words.
But his head turns at the mention of his name.

The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs. A cloud of
SMOKE obscures him -- and then, as if he skipped the
stairs, he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck-

This is BARBOSSA. Despite the bright colors of clothing,
definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley --
or anywhere, for that matter.

Elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from
his eyes. But she musters her courage -

                    ELIZABETH
          I am here to --

The Bosun SLAPS her.

                    BOSUN
          You'll speak when spoken to!

His wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa.

                    BARBOSSA
          And you'll not lay a hand on those
          under the protection of parlay!

                       BOSUN
          Aye, sir.

Barbossa releases him. Turns to Elizabeth, smiles -- it
shows both silver and gold teeth.

                       BARBOSSA

          My apologies, miss. As you were
          saying, before you were so rudely
          interrupted?

                    ELIZABETH
          Captain Barbossa ... I have come
          to negotiate the cessation of
          hostilities against Port Royal.

Barbossa is both impressed and amused.

                    BARBOSSA
          There was a lot of long words in
          there, miss, and we're not but
          humble pirates. What is it you
          want?

                     ELIZABETH
          I want you to leave. And never
          come back.

Barbossa and the pirates laugh.

                    BARBOSSA
          I am disinclined to acquiesce to
          your request.
              (helpfully)
          Means' No. '

                       ELIZABETH
          Very well.

She quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side
rail, dangles it over the side of the ship. The pirates go
quiet.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I'll drop it!

                    BARBOSSA
          My holds are bursting with swag.
          That bit of shine matters to me
          ... Why?

                    ELIZABETH
          Because it's what you're searching
          for. You've been searching for it
          for years. I recognize this ship.

          I saw it eight years ago, when we
          made the crossing from England.

                    BARBOSSA
              (interested)
          Did you, now?

Elizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere.

                    ELIZABETH
          Fine. I suppose if this is
          worthless, there's no reason to
          keep it.

She flips the medallion up, off her finger -

                    BARBOSSA
          NO!

She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You have a name, missy?

                     ELIZABETH
          Elizabeth -
              (stops herself from
               saying "Swann"; then:)
          Turner.
              (embroidering)
          I'm a maid in the governor's
          household.
              (curtsies)
          Barbossa reacts to the name
          Turner: it confirms what he has
          suspected. The other pirates
          surreptitiously exchange glances
          and nods.

                    BARBOSSA
          You've got sand, for a maid.

                    ELIZABETH
              (curtsies again)
          Thank you, sir.

                    BARBOSSA

          And how does a maid come to own a
          trinket such as that? A family
          heirloom, perhaps?

                    ELIZABETH
          Of course.
              (offended)
          I didn't steal it, if that's what
          you mean.

                    BARBOSSA
          No, no, nothing like that.
              (comes to a decision)
          Very well. You hand that over,
          we'll put your town to our rudder
          and ne'er return.

                    ELIZABETH
          Can I trust you?

                    BARBOSSA
          It's you who invoked the parlay!
          Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand
          it over, now... or these be the
          last friendly words you'll hear!

Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds out
the medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like
hope.

                    ELIZABETH
          Our bargain. . ?

Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun.

                    BOSUN
          Still the guns, and stow 'em!
          Signal the men, set the flags, and
          make good to clear port!

For the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of
the guns ceases. Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved.
The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away.

                    ELIZABETH
          Wait! You must return me to shore!
          According to the rules of the
          Order of the Brethren -

Barbossa wheels on her.

                     BARBOSSA
          First. Your return to shore was
          not part of our negotiations nor
          our agreement, and so I 'must' do
          nothing. Secondly: you must be a
          pirate for the pirate's code to
          apply. And you're not. And
          thirdly...

the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual
rules.

(grins gold and silver)

Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner.

Elizabeth stares in speechless terror -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN

As the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back
along the deck to the captain's cabin.

The fog starts to dissipate, turning to a light mist;
through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of
dawn.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN

Will comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet.

He takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is
dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed
and still smolder. The aftermath of hell on earth.

Will turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - MORNING

Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls
out:

                    WILL
          Miss Swann! Elizabeth!

A terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned
chair, fallen bookshelf -

INT. FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTON'S OFFICE - MORNING

Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe.

                     WILL
          They've taken her! They've taken
          Elizabeth!

A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette
among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it
drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a
chair.

                    NORRINGTON
          We're aware of the situation.

                    WILL
          We have to hunt them down -- and
          save her!

Swann's worry has made him short-tempered.

                    SWANN
          Where do you propose we start? If
          you have any information that
          concerns my daughter, then share
          it! If anyone does, tell me!
              (Will is silent)
          Leave, Mr. Turner.

Murtogg has remembered something. He ventures it warily:

                    MURTOGG
          That Jack Sparrow... he talked
          about the Black Pearl.

                    MULLROY
          Mentioned it, is more what he did.

                     MURTOGG
          Still --

                    WILL
          We can ask him where it is --
          maybe he can lead us to it!

                     SWANN

          That pirate tried to kill my
          daughter. We could never trust a
          word he said!

                    WILL
          We could strike a bargain -

                    NORRINGTON
          No. The pirates who invaded   this
          fort left Sparrow locked in   his
          cell. Ergo, he is not their   ally,
          and therefore of no value.
              (through with Will)
          We will determine their most
          likely course, and launch a   search
          mission that sails with the   tide.

Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.

                    WILL
          That's not good enough. This is
          Elizabeth's life!

Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across
Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.

                    NORRINGTON
          Mr. Turner, this is not the time
          for rash actions.
              (low)
          Do not make the mistake of
          thinking you are the only man here
          who loves Elizabeth.
              (firm)
          Now, go home.

He opens the door, and then turns away. Will watches him
walk back to the desk. Will's face sets in resolve, and he
leaves.

INT. FORT CHARLES - JAIL CELLS - MORNING

Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. Even with
the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. He hears
the sound of the door latch -

The door opens, and Will slips in. Looks around. Jack
lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and
unconcerned. Will marches straight up to the bars.

                    WILL
          Are you familiar with that ship?
          The Black Pearl?

                      JACK
          Somewhat.

                    WILL
          Where does it make berth?

                    JACK
          Surely you've heard the stories? The
          Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla
          de Mureta... an island that cannot be
          found -- except by those who already
          know where it is.

                    WILL
          The ship's real enough. So its
          anchorage must be a real place. Where
          is it?

                    JACK
          Why ask me?

                    WILL
          Because you're a pirate.

                    JACK
          And you want to turn pirate
          yourself?

                    WILL
          Never.
              (beat)
          They took Miss Swann.

                    JACK
              (he was right)
          So it is that you found a girl. Well,
          if you're intending to brave all and
          hasten to her rescue and so win fair
          lady's heart, you'll have to do it
          alone. I see no profit in it for me.

Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration. Jack
is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ... makes a
decision.

                    WILL
          I can get you out of here.

                    JACK
          How? The key's run off.

                    WILL
              (examines the cell)
          I helped build these cells. Those are
          hook-and-ring hinges. The proper
          application of strength, the door'll
          lift free. Just calls for the right
          lever and fulcrum. . .

Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will
is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.

                    JACK
          Your name is Turner.

Will gives him a puzzled look.

                    WILL
          Yes. Will Turner.

Jack grins.

                    JACK
          Will Turner...
              (he stands)
          I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've
          changed my mind. You spring me from
          this cell, and on pain of death, I'll
          you to the Black Pearl.
              (sticks out his hand)
          Do we have an accord?

Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good.
Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it.

                    WILL
          Agreed.

                    JACK
          Agreed!

Will looks around, figures out   what he needs. He makes a
chair his fulcrum, and levers   the long bench under the
door. Pushes down -- it's hard   work -- but the cell door
rises, and then falls forward,   CRASHING down on the bench
and chair.

Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.

                    WILL
          Someone will have heard that.
          Hurry.

Will heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards.

                    JACK
          Not without my effects.

                    WILL
          We need to go!

Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on
the belt, checks the shot in his pistol.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          Why are you bothering with that?

                     JACK
          My business, Will. As for your business
          -one question, or there's no use going.
               (joins Will at the door)
          This girl -- what does she mean to you?
          How far are you willing to go to save
          her?

                    WILL
              (no hesitation)
          I'd die for her.

                    JACK
          Good.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING

The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats
low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its
lines.

                    JACK (O.S.)
          Ah, now there's a lovely sight!

Jack hops down into the boat. Prepares to make way.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report
          her. Honest men are slaves to their
          conscience, and there's no predicting
          'em. But you can always trust a
          dishonest man to stay that way...

Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock,
staring at the boat in dismay.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Come aboard.

                    WILL
          I haven't set foot off dry land I was
          twelve, when the ship I was on
          exploded.
              (regards the boat)
          It's been a sound policy.

                    JACK
          No worries there. She's far more
          likely to rot out from under us.

Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to
capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Besides, we are about to better
          our prospects considerably.

He nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor.
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales.

                    WILL
          We're going to steal a ship? That
          ship?

                    JACK
          Commandeer. We're going to
          commandeer a ship. Nautical term.

                    WILL
          It's still against the law.

                    JACK

          So's breaking a man out of jail. Face
          it, Will: you may say you'll never be a
          pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring
          start.
              (smiling)
          My advice -- smile and enjoy it.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - MORNING

The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against
the H.M.S. Dauntless. Will holds a stay line with iron
fists.

                     WILL
          This is either crazy, or
          brilliant.

                    JACK
          Remarkable how often those two
          traits coincide.

The Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship -

EXT. H. M. S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING

There's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy
sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing
dice. Murtogg and Mullroy among them.

Suddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open -

brandishing pistols.

                    JACK
          Everybody stay calm. We're taking
          over the ship!

                    WILL
              (a beat)
          Aye! Avast!

Jack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that.

The sailors all look   at them -- and then burst out
LAUGHING. They grin,   shake their heads. Jack stands there,
grinning with them --   but his gun is still level. The
Lieutenant, GILLETTE,   steps forward.

                       GILLETTE

          You're serious about this.

Jack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette.

                    JACK
          Dead serious.

                    GILLETTE
          You understand this ship cannot be
          crewed by only two men. You'll never
          make it out of the bay.

                    JACK
          We'll see about that.

More guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors move forward,
hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand.

                    GILLETTE
          Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed
          or wounded in this foolish enterprise.

                    JACK
          Fine by me. We brought you a nice
          little boat, so you can all get back to
          shore, safe and sound.

                    GILLETTE
              (a curt nod)
          Agreed. You have the momentary
          advantage, sir. But I will see you
          smile from the yard arm sir.

                    JACK
          As likely as not.
              (calling)
          Will, short up the anchor, we've
          got ourselves a ship!

EXT. DAUNTLESS - STERN - MORNING

Sailors make their way down a rope ladder, crowd onto the
Jolly Mon. Will pushes hard against the windlass, to no
avail ... the anchor is too heavy for one man. Jack
notices.

                    JACK
          A little help?

Gillette shrugs, gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy. The three
men throw their weight into the windlass, and it turns.
Jack's pistol is on them the whole time.

                    MURTOGG
          I can't believe he's doing this.

The windless turns, bringing Mullroy into view.

                    MULLROY
          You didn't believe he was telling the
          truth, either.

The windless turns some more, and there's Gillette.

                    GILLETTE
              (over his shoulder, to Will)
          Do you have any idea, boy, what you're
          doing?

Another quarter turn -

                      WILL
          No.

EXT. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

Jack and Will crank a capstan, raising the forward jib
sail. It luffs and billows out. The huge ship inches
forward slowly, pulled by just the one sail. Jack grins.

                    JACK
          Lookee there, mate! We're
          underway!

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCK - DAY

Norrington moves along, concentrating on a manifest.
Alongside him is governor Swann, who glances over -

Sees the tiny Jolly Mon headed toward them, riding low in
the water, overloaded with sailors. Beyond that, the
Dauntless sails -- albeit slowly -- for open waters.

                    SWANN
          Commodore --

                      NORRINGTON
          A moment.

                    SWANN
          But --

                    NORRINGTON
          Please.

                    SWANN
          Dammit, man, it appears someone is
          stealing your ship!

Norrington glances out at the bay. Sure enough, the
Dauntless is on the move. Norrington takes a brass
telescope from his belt, opens it, trains it on --

The main deck. He picks out Will -

                    NORRINGTON
          Rash, Turner, too rash.

-- then spots Jack, at the wheel. Lowers the telescope.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          That is, without doubt, the worst
          pirate I have ever seen.

EXT. H . M. S. DAUNTLESS - DAY

Out in the open sea, Jack leans on the wheel, relaxed; not
much sailing to do with a following wind. Will looks back -

                    WILL
          They're coming!

He points: the sails of the Interceptor fill out, and the
ship cuts through the water toward them-

EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Norrington's smaller ship quickly comes alongside the
slowmoving Dauntless. Its decks appear empty. Grappling
hooks are thrown, and sailors draw the two ships together.

Norrington's men swarm across.

                    NORRINGTON
          Search every cabin, every hold,
          down to the bilges!

PULL BACK, away from the   Dauntless, and past the railing of
the Interceptor, where a   single SENTRY stands watch -- and
we find a soaked Jack and   Will as they climb up over the
side of the smaller ship,   unseen.

Jack tackles the Sentry from behind, covers hi1rmouth.

                    JACK
          Can you swim?
              (the man struggles)
          Can. You. Swim?

Jack removes his hand.

                    SENTRY
          Of course, sir. Like a fish. I
          grew up summers living in Dover,
          with my uncle -

                    JACK
          Good.

Jack lifts the man up, throws him overboard. Quickly unties
the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan
bars, raising the foresail -

EXT. H . M. S. DAUNTLESS - DAY

Norrington emerges from a gangway -- and sees his other
ship moving away.

                    NORRINGTON
          Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!

But the distance is already too great. One brave sailor
tries to swing across on a rope, Errol-Flynn style, but
falls short with a splash.

Jack waves, and shouts across the distance -

                    JACK
          Thank you, Commodore, for getting our
          ship ready to make way! We'd've had a
          hard time of it by ourselves!

Norrington seethes, but his order to Gillette is measured:

                    NORRINGTON
          Raise the sails.

                    GILLETTE
          The wind is quarter from astern
          ... by the time we're underway,
          we'll never catch them.

                    NORRINGTON
          We need only to come about, to put
          them in range of the long nines.

Gillette looks surprised at the order -- but relays it.

                    GILLETTE
          Hands! Come about! Jackets off the
          cannons!
              (to Norrington)
          We are to fire on our own ship?

                    NORRINGTON
          Better to see it at the bottom of the
          sea than in the hands of a pirate.

The STEERSMAN turns the wheel. The Dauntless' course does
not change one whit.

                    STEERSMAN
          Captain, there's a problem.

The Steersman spins the wheel. It goes round and round,
with no signs of slowing.

                    STEERSMAN (CONT'D)
          He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

                    NORRINGTON
          So it would seem.

The Interceptor dwindles with distance. Gillette watches it
go, with some degree of admiration.

                    GILLETTE
          He's got to be the best pirate
          I've ever seen.

Norrington reaches out, stops the spinning ship's wheel.

                    NORRINGTON
          So it would seem.

The Interceptor makes for the horizon line. A SLOW DISSOLVE
and with the time passage, the ship is gone; the sky turns
a deep twilight blue -

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - EVENING

-- with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon.
Suddenly, the edge of a black sail cuts into the
foreground, accompanied by the ROAR of the wind and the
SNAP of canvas -

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - EVENING

Elizabeth stalks the cabin. Pintel enters, carrying a black
silk dress.

                    PINTEL
          You'll be dining with the Captain,
          and he requests you wear this.

                    ELIZABETH
          Tell the captain that I am disinclined
          to acquiesce to his request.

                    PINTEL
              (happy)
          He said you say that! He also said if
          that be the case, you'll be dining with
          the crew, and you'll be naked.

Angry, Elizabeth holds out her hand. Pintel's grin fades.

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
              (hands it over)
          Fine.

He exits, pouting. Elizabeth examines the dress -

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Barbossa enters, followed by PIRATES carrying trays of
food, wine, table setting, etc. Elizabeth stands at the
small table in the dress -- lovely.

                    BARBOSSA
          Maid or not, it fits you.

                    ELIZABETH

          Dare I ask the fate of its previous
          owner?

                    BARBOSSA
          Now, none of that. Please dig in.

The table is set. Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of
meat, eats it daintily.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          No need to stand on ceremony, and no
          call to impress anyone. You must be
          hungry.

Elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to
eat like it. Barbossa watches her intently.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Try the wine.

Elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread,
devours it.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          And the apples -- one of those next.

She starts to bite into the apple -- stops. She is suddenly
aware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating.

                    ELIZABETH
          It's poisoned!

She shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to
palm her knife. Barbossa LAUGHS.

                    BARBOSSA
          Oh, there would be no sense in killing
          you, Miss Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then why aren't you eating?

                    BARBOSSA
          Would that I could.

He produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

          Do you not know what this is,
          then?

                    ELIZABETH
          It's a pirate medallion.

                    BARBOSSA
          It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de
          Muerta .

Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despite
herself.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT 'D)
          Ah, so you don't know as much as you
          pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a
          great bloody swath through the New
          World, a high priest gave. him all the
          gold they had, with one condition: that
          he spare the people's lives. Of course,
          Cortes being Cortes, he didn't.
              (nods)
          He'd've made a great pirate, that one.

Barbossa stands, moves to a shelf. Puts a key to a medium-
sized polished wooden box -- the Captain's chest. Opens it.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          So the priest, with his dying breath,
          called on the power of the blood of his
          people, and put on the gold a curse. If
          anyone took so much as a single piece,
          as he was compelled by greed, by greed
          he would be consumed.

Inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and a

few pages of a Mayan CODEX, pieces of tree bark inscribed
with Mayan glyphs. Barbossa removes them carefully, sets
them on the table. Pours over them.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Within a day of leaving port for Spain,
          the treasure ship carrying the gold ...
          something went wrong. The ship run
          aground, every man aboard dead, save
          one. He survived long enough to hide
          the gold ashore.

              (beat)
          Over time, the dark magic of the curse
          seeped into the place, making it a
          cursed island. An island of death. Isla
          de Muerta.

He looks up. Elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story
-but feigns a dismissive attitude.

                    ELIZABETH
          That's all very interesting, but I
          hardly believe in ghost stories
          any more.

Barbossa is angry. He stands, sweeps the food off the
table.

                    BARBOSSA
          You idiot girl! It's no make-
          believe! My crew and I, we found
          the gold, and we did more than
          take one piece, we took it all.
          Rich men we were and we spent it
          and traded it and gave it away in
          exchange

for drink and food and pleasant company. But we found out:
the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashes
in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease
our torment.

(regains his composure)

We are cursed men, Miss Turner,

condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed. Gold
calls to UB, always, and we are driven, always, to find
more, and add it to the treasure.

Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex. Crushes them in his
fist.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          There is but one way to remove the
          curse. All of the scattered pieces
          of the treasure must be restored
          in full, and the blood repaid.

                 (he throws the pages
                  aside)
             We've recovered every piece --
             save for this.
                 (holds up the medallion)
             And as for the blood ... that's
             what we have you for.
                 (pleasant, finally
                  getting to his point)
             And that's why there's no sense in
             killing you. Yet.

Elizabeth stares at him, horrified. Using the toe of his
boot, Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it,
extends it to Elizabeth.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             Apple?

Elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple -- and then comes up
out of her chair, trying to run around Barbossa_ They
struggle briefly, and then suddenly he shoves her away-

Elizabeth's stolen KNIFE is buried in Barbossa's chest, to
the hilt --

Barbossa is completely unaffected. He opens his shirt to
get a better look at the knife, pulls it out with little
effort. There is BLOOD on the blade, but none anywhere
else.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             I'm curious -- after killing me,
             what is it you were planning to do
             next?

Elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door -

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth comes to dead stop. She stares, her jaw
working, trying to scream but unable to -

The pirate crew works at their stations, coiling lines,
navigating the ship, swabbing decks -- but where the
moonlight falls across their bodies, they are nauqht but
SKELETONS. .

Elizabeth turns away from the sight -

Barbossa stands just inside the doorway, out of the
moonlight. He grabs her roughly by the shoulders and jerks
her back around -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes -

                    BARBOSSA
          Look!
              (shakes her)
          LOOK! The moonlight shows us for
          what we really are! We are not
          among the living and so we cannot
          die -

He spins her back around to face him -- he leans forward,
putting his face in the moonlight, turning it into a
gleaming SKULL with gold and silver teeth -

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          -- but neither are we dead! We
          have all the desires of the
          living, but cannot satisfy them!
          Ten years I have been parched of
          thirst, and unable to quench it!
          Ten years, I have been starving to
          death -- and haven't died!
              (raises his hand)

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          And I have not felt anything for
          ten years ... Not the wind on my
          face, nor the spray of the sea ...
              (reaches toward
               Elizabeth)
          ... nor the flesh of a woman ...

Elizabeth flinches away from the skeletal hand. It drops
away -- he takes a bottle of wine from the opened case
beside the cabin door, uncorks it with his teeth, raises it
-

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You'd best start believing in
          ghost stories, Miss Turner.
          Because now you're in one.

He tilts the bottle and drinks -- it runs over his jaw,
through his rib cage, drenching his clothes.

Elizabeth darts around him, back into the cabin, and shuts
the door. Barbossa hurls the bottle away.

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin,
terrified.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Interceptor cuts across the waves. Jack at the wheel;
Will tightens a line, moves back astern.

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - MAIN DECK - DAY

Will sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk
...

                    JACK
          For a man whose made an industry
          of avoiding boats, you're a quick
          study.

                     WILL
          I worked passage   from England as a
          cabin boy.
              (an attempt  at guile)
          After my mother  passed, I came out
          here ... looking  for my father.

                    JACK
          Is that so?

                    WILL
          My father. William Turner?

Jack says nothing. Will has lost the patience for guile.

                    WILL ( CONT ' D)
          I'm not a simpleton. At the jail -
          - it was only after you learned my
          name that you agreed to help.
              (a smile)
          Since that's what I wanted, I
          didn't press the matter. But now -

{an accusation}

You knew my father.

Jack considers his reply -- settles on 'truth.'

                    JACK
          I knew him. Probably one of the
          few who knew him as William
          Turner. Most everyone just called
          him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

                    WILL
          'Bootstrap?'

                    JACK
          Good man. Good pirate. And clever
          -"- I never met anyone with as
          clever a mind and hands as him.
          When you were puzzling out that
          cell door, it was like seeing his
          twin.

                    WILL
              (angry)
          That's not true.

                    JACK
          I swear, you look just like him.

                    WILL
          It's not true that my father was a
          pirate.

                    JACK
          Figured you wouldn't want to hear
          it.

                    WILL
          He was a merchant marine! He was a
          respectable man who obeyed the
          law, and followed the rules--

                    JACK
              (laughs)
          You think your father is the only
          man who ever lived the Glasgow
          life, telling folk one thing, and
          then going off to do another?
          There's quite a few who come here,
          hoping to amass enough swag to
          ease the burdens of respectable

          life. And they're all 'merchant
          marines.'

                    WILL
          My father did not think of my
          mother -his family -- as a burden.

                    JACK
          Sure -- because he could always go
          pirating.

                    WILL
          My father -- was not -- a pirate!

Will's sword is out, levelled at Jack. Jack gives him a
disbelieving look, sighs.

                    JACK
          Put it away, Will. It's not worth
          getting beat again.

                    WILL
          You didn't beat me. You ignored
          the rules of engagement. In a fair
          fight, I'd kill you.

                    JACK
          Then that's not much incentive for
          me to fight fair, is it?

He kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and
slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His
sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles above the water.

Jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the
course. Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it.
Will hand-over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the
boom.

                    JACK ( CONT ' D)
          As long as you're just hanging
          there, pay attention. Must,
          Should, do, don't, shall, shall
          not -- those are just suggestions.
          There are only two absolute rules.
              (ticks them off on his
               fingers)

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What a man can do. And what a man
          can I t do.

Will looks away, not interested.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          For instance: you can accept that
          your father was a pirate and still
          a good man... or you can't. Now
          me, I can sail this ship to
          Tortuga, by myself. . .
              (Will looks alarmed)
          But I can't just let you drown.

Jack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack
holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at
Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him
coolly.

Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down,
and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk
...

Jack breathes silent sigh of relief. Notices his hand is
shaking -- he takes the wheel.

                     WILL
          Tortuga?

                    JACK
          Oh -- did I forget to mention
          that?

EXT. TORTUGA - DAY

A dank and dirty port, where the tides seem to have swept
together the scum of the Caribbean -- pirates, privateers,
prostitutes, thieves, and drunkards.

With its cantered, rotting docks, weatherbeaten buildings,
and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey,
chickens, etc. -- it is far less civilized than Port Royal.

Jack and Will move through the crowd. A REDHEADED woman
turns her head -- she has noticed Jack.

                     JACK

          We need a crew. We can manage the
          ship between islands, but the open
          sea, that's another matter -

Suddenly the Redhead SLAPS Jack, hard. Satisfied, she turns
and strides off. Will ignores her.

                    WILL
          Just do it quickly.

                    JACK
              (rubbing his jaw)
          Don't worry. I've already got my
          Quartermaster -- there!

Jack leads Will toward a pub: the Faithful Bride, the
emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a
smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled
hands.

Jack pulls open the door; Will goes inside passing a pretty
ASIAN women coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately
SLAPS him, cursing something in Chinese. Jack backs away -

INT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY

Jack closes the door on the woman, joins Will. They take in
the place -- it is populated with a slightly higher class
of scum. Jack spots a BARTENDER, smiles, moves forward -

--and is suddenly DECKED by a waitress. This is ANAMARIA,
tall, strong, tough; she didn't spill a drink off her tray.

                    ANAMARIA
          You stole my boat.

                    JACK
          AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I
          need to put together -

She SLAPS him again. Will shakes his head, heads for the
bar. Jack gets up.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Borrowed. Borrowed your boat.
              (off her look)
          Without permission.

AnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between
them. She chases him around the table, still carrying the
tray.

                    ANAMARIA
          My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is
          it?

                    JACK
          Safe! At Port Royal. With the
          Royal Navy.

                    ANAMARIA
          That boat is my livelihood!

                    JACK
          You'll get it back. Or one better.

                    ANAMARIA
              (a threat)
          I will.

Away from them, a PATRON calls for his food. AnaMaria
scowls at Jack, moves away -- comes back for. one more
SLAP!

                    WILL
          Jack! Over here!

AT THE BAR, Will has spoken to the Bartender. Jack arrives,
rubbing his chin.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          He knows Gibbs.

The Bartender nods 'yes.' Then nods 'out back.' Then
produces a water bucket from behind the bar.

Jack and Will exchange a look,-and Jack takes the bucket.

EXT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - REAR - DAY

A drunken man lays in the mud, having a friendly
conversation with two pigs. He wears an old tattered Navy
jacket.

A sudden SPRAY OF WATER splashes across his face,
revealing: this is old JOSHAMEE GIBBS (the man who told

pirate stories to Elizabeth when she was a child). He
sputters and roars:

                    GIBBS
          Curse you for breathing, you
          slack-jawed idiot
              (recognizes Jack)
          Mother's love, Jack, you know
          better than to wake a man when
          he's sleeping. It's bad luck!

                    JACK
          Well, fortunately, I know how to
          counter it. The man who did the waking
          buys the man who was sleeping a drink,
          and the man who was sleeping it drinks
          it while listening to a proposition.

                    GIBBS
          Aye, that'll about do it.

Jack helps Gibbs to his feet -- and then Gibbs is hit with
a second wave of water. Will stands there with the bucket.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Blast it, I'm already awake!

                    WILL
          I know. That was for the smell.

INT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY

Jack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single
candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices. Will is
away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look-
out.

A tankard is set down. Gibbs lifts it to take a swig -

                    JACK
          Just the one.

Gibbs pauses. He takes a dainty sip.

                    GIBBS
          Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the
          nature of this venture of yours?

                    JACK

          First -- have you found me a crew?

                    GIBBS
          Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack.
          Most of the decent pirates in town
          won't sail with you -- seem to
          think you're a jinx.

                    JACK
          Now where, I wonder, would they
          have gotten that idea?

Gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip. Jack leans
forward. Gibbs leans forward.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I'm going after the Black Pearl.

Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. He
reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it
back down. He leans forwards again. Jack has not moved.

                       GIBBS
          Say again?

                    JACK
          Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I
          know where its going to be, and
          I'm going to take it.

                     GIBBS
          Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've
          heard the tales they tell about
          the Pearl.

                    JACK
          Aye, and that's why I know where it's
          going to be, and that's why I know what
          Barbossa is up to. All I need is a
          crew.

                    GIBBS
              (shakes his head)
          A fool's errand.

                       JACK

          Not if the fool has something
          Barbossa wants. Something he
          needs.

                    GIBBS
          And you've got that, have you?

ANGLE ON: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his
eyes' -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor
away from the table.

                    JACK
          Back there, guarding the door is
          the son of old Bootstrap Bill
          Turner.

Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers at
Will. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones.

                    GIBBS
          Well, lookee there. I'll allow you
          may be onto something, Jack.
              (considers, nods)
          There's bound to be sailors on
          this rock crazy as you. I'll find
          some men.

Gibbs downs the drink, SLAMS the tankard on the table.

Will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger,
kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who
moves.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?

                    JACK
          That he is.

EXT. TORTUGA - DOCK - LATER - DAY

On the docks, a disheveled, motley and weatherbeaten group
of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up.

                    GIBBS
          Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em
          good sea-faring men, faithful hands
          before the mast, every one worth his
          salt --

              (sotto, making his point)
          -- and crazy, to boot.

Jack holds up a hand -- enough. He moves down the line,
Gibbs at his side. Then he notices AnaMaria in line,
dressed like a man, He raises an eyebrow.

                    ANAMARIA
          You owe me a boat.

Jack nods, continues. One sailor is quite fat, another
thin and sickly. Jack is not happy with his choices.

He stops in front of COTTON, a short sailor with a large,
colorful PARROT on his shoulder. Jack raises an eyebrow.

                    GIBBS
          Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor
          devil had his tongue cut out --

Cotton opens his mouth to show this -- Jack grimaces.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          -- so he went and trained the parrot to
          do the talking for him, nobody knows
          how. Nobody knows the parrot's name,
          neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's
          parrot.'

Jack decides to test this.

                    JACK
          Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage
          and fortitude to follow orders and stay
          true, in the face danger, and almost
          certain death?

Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it --

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS!

                    GIBBS
          Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'

Cotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goes
silent. Jack shakes his head. Steps back.

                    JACK

          That goes for the rest of you!
          Danger and near certain death.
              (turns away)
          For we are to sail for the Isla de
          Muerta, to rescue the daughter of
          Governor Swann. An equal share of the
          reward shall be -

Jack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crew
members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn
and run, followed by more.

Soon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (with
parrot) -- and AnaMaria.

                    WILL
          Shut up, before you lose them all!

                    JACK
          These are the only ones worth
          having.
              (glances at the sky)
          And we're going to need them-

EXT. H. M. S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

A FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder. The canvas
of every sail is stretched taut. The ship rocks as it drops
into the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side.

On board, the new crew members scurry about their tasks,
pulling lines and trimming sails. Excellent sailors, it
takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat.

AnaMaria is at the helm. Gibbs staggers along the deck.

                    GIBBS
          That fool will have us lose the
          canvas, and the masts besides!

On Jack, a ROARING wind blowing back his hair, eyes intent
on their course. Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Werd best drop canvas, sirl

                    JACK
          She can hold a bit longer.

The wind picks up, howling. Jack smiles.

                    GIBBS
              (shouts)
          What's in your head to put you in such
          a fine mood?

                    JACK
              (shouts)
          We're catching up!

Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself. Gibbs stares
at him like he's a crazy man.'

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY

The sound of RAIN pounds down on the deck above - - then
suddenly stops. Elizabeth moves to the stern windows, looks
out at the rolling sea below -- no escape there.

She hears the sound of a VQICE calling, gazes up, wondering
-

EXT. BLACK PEARL - CROW' S NEST - DAY

High on the main mast, Twigg cups his hands to his face, calls
down:

                    TWIGG
          Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta,
          off the port bow!

ON DECK, Barbossa moves to the rail. The storm clouds are
breaking up. On the horizon is a dark, ominous shape: ISLA DE
MUERTA. Mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight into
the water. It is surrounded by a slate grey sea.

Barbossa grasps the rail with both hands, his expression a
mixture of loathing and fear. Jacoby approaches, hesitant.

                    JACOBY
          Orders, Captain?

                    BARBOSSA
          Bring her in, not too close. I won't
          brave the reef, not until high tide. We
          lay anchor before dark.

Jacoby nods, backs away. Barbossa continues to stare -

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          ... that is, if it first doesn't
          sink back down to hell from where
          it came.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sails
set wing-to-wing.

EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

CLOSE ON: Jack's compass, cradled in both hands. Jack leans
over and studies it -- almost like he's praying.

ON THE COMPASS -- the face shows old-fashioned rose petal
style direction markers below a quivering indicator that
settles on -- southeast.

                    JACK
          Bear three points starboard.

AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. The ship leans
into the new direction. Jack looks down -

ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins, reverses,
settles on -- northeast.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Six points port!

AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel
back, and the ship responds.

Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack
and AnaMaria, clearly not happy. Gibbs hobbles up.

                    GIBBS
          Left handed-ropes are coiled against
          the sun, or it's bad luck!
              (twirls a finger)
          Anty-clockwise.

Gibbs takes over the task. The ship shifts course again.
Will has had enough.

                    WILL

          How do we expect to find an island no
          one can find -- with a compass that
          doesn't work?

                    GIBBS
          Now, lad, just because it don't point
          north don't mean it don't work.
              (voice low)
          That compass gives bearings to the Isla
          de Muerta, wherever it may lie.

                    WILL
          Really?
              (moves closer)
          So ... what's the story on the
          pistol?

Gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener.

                    GIBBS
          I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow
          has an honest streak in him, and
          that's where the whole problem
          starts. This was when he was
          Captain of the Black Pearl -

                    WILL
          What? He never told me that.

                    GIBBS
          Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things
          more close to the vest. See, Jack was a
          cartographer, back in Old England.
          Somehow I he came by the money to
          commission the Pearl. Hired himself a
          crew, promised each man an equal share.
              (lowers his voice)
          So, they're forty days out, and the
          First Mate says, everything's an equal
          share, that should mean the location of
          the island, too. So Jack gave up the
          bearings.
              (shakes his head)
          That night, there was mutiny.

Gibbs voice is a whisper, now, so Will has to lean closer.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)

          Jack gave hisself up for the sake of
          his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on
          an island, left there to die.

                    WILL
          How did he get off the island?

                    JACK
              (loud)
          I didn't!

Will and Gibbs jump. Jack is right there beside them.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          My body's still there, rotting
          away, and I am but a ghost!

Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. Jack
laughs.

                    GIBBS
          How did you get off the island?

                    JACK
          Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant
          tale, best left untold.

He starts off.

                    WILL
          Wait -- what about the pistol?

                    JACK
          The pistol. When a pirate is marooned,
          Will, he's given a pistol with a single
          shot. No good for hunting, or
          surviving, really. But after three
          weeks of starvation and thirst -- the
          option of that pistol begins to look
          good.

Jack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          But I survived. And I still have
          that single shot. It's meant for
          one man. My mutinous first mate -

                    WILL

          Barbossa.

Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

On Barbossa, face upturned. No expression in his eyes.

Around him a group of pirates, Elizabeth among them, stand
as still as stones, in front of a dark cave opening. Their
faces look upward, their total lack of movement
disconcerting.

Above the cave, on a hillock, the pirate Koehler gazes out
toward the horizon. Slowly he TRANSFORMS, head-to-toe, from
pirate to SKELETON-

The MOON has climbed free of the storm clouds, rising
large. and full on the horizon. The skeleton turns -

                    KOEHLER
          Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.

                      BARBOSSA
          Hah!
              (to the pirates)
          Be mindful of pits and crevasses.
          Stay together.

He takes a torch. Moves into the cave. The pirates follow.

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE -     CAVES    - NIGHT

The group keeps together under the firelight. The path
leads between boulders on a slope downhill. From the echoes
and shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge.

Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off
to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins.
Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness.

Twigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away from
the group. Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm.

                    BARBOSSA
          Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd
          die and miss Judgement Day -- for not
          even the Lord himself'll come look for
          you here.

Barbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twisting
and turning, but always down -

EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - NIGHT

Cotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something. He
lifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along the
back.

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND
          ho!

Indeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the
distance on the port side. Will stands, excited, jumps onto
the rigging for a better look.

But AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and the
parrot.

                    ANAMARIA
          How does he do that?

                    JACK
          They'll be anchored on the lee side.
          Haul your wind, and keep to the weather
          of the island -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVES - NIGHT

Flickering torchlight. Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern
-

-- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de

Muerta: overflowing ,chests of coins, gold and silver
ingots, jewelry, objects d' art, jade and ivory, brightly
colored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors and
swords -anything and everything of value that might be
carried by ship, is here.

The pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze in
wonder.

                    ELIZABETH
          The curse drove you to gather
          this?

                    BARBOSSA (O.S.)

          Aye. And not a bit of it any use
          to us, only hoarded. But it will
          drive us no longer.

Elizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted
mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - LAGOON - NIGHT

The Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance. Closer,
Jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a small
longboat, toward the rocky shore.

The RUSH of a waterfall grows louder. Will looks: ahead of
them is a black CAVE MOUTH, right at water level.

                    WILL
          What's that?

                     JACK
          Depends.

                     WILL
          On what?

                    JACK
          On whether the stories are    all
          true. If they are, that's    a
          waterfall that spills over    at high
          tide, with a short drop to    an
          underground lagoon. If not    -

By now, the moving water tugs on the longboat, and they are
sucked in --

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          -- well, too late.

The boat rushes forward, plunges into the darkness -

INT. CAVES - UNDERWATER LAGOON - NIGHT

-- the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short
waterfall ... but then lands safely in a gorgeous
underwater lagoon, floats lazily toward a sandy shore.

                    JACK
          Chalk one up for the stories.

Will leaps out into the water, pulls the boat ashore -

INT. CAVES - BED CAVERN - NIGHT

The pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of
mostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed -

INT. CAVES - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

-- and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, also
crammed with treasure, including several mountains of gold
coins that reach the ceiling. Treasure everywhere -

Except for one spot in the center. A hole in the ceiling
lets in a column of moonlight, which illumines:

A stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved Aztec
glyphs, filled with gold coins identical to Will's
medallion. A sharp stone knife lies on top.

In front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton -- and
this one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again,
judging by the sword in its back. A crab scurries away from
it as the group approaches.

                    BARBOSSA
          Here we stand before the cursed
          treasure of Cortez himself. Won by
          blood, it demands blood in return.

All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth. Pintle takes the stone
knife from the chest, approaches her. Elizabeth shrinks
back, but is held by two other pirates.

Pintel grins. Grabs her by the wrist. She turns her head
away, shuts her eyes.

Pintle raises the knife ...

... and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharp
tip of the knife to just prick! Elizabeth's finger.

One tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto the
medallion.

Elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised.

                    PINTEL

             What did you expect? We're all
             gentlemen here, right and proper.

The pirates laugh. Barbossa takes the medallion, grins at
Elizabeth.

                       BARBOSSA
             You know the first thing I'm going
             to do after the curse is lifted?
                 (grins)
             Eat a whole bushel of apples.

Barbossa approaches the chest, shining in the beam of

moonlight.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             What was begun by blood, let blood
             now end!

He tosses the gold medallion onto the others.

The pirates tense, waiting, expectant. A long beat. They
all look at each other, look at themselves. Nothing
happens.

                       KOEHLER
             Did it work?

                       DEADEYE
             I don't feel no different.

                       JACOBY
             How do we tell?

Barbossa frowns, draws his pistol, and SHOOTS the pirate
next to him -- Jacoby -- square in the chest. Jacoby reacts
in shock, grabs his chest ... but doesn't die.

                       KOEHLER
             You're not dead.

                       JACOBY
             No.
                 (realizes)
             He shot me!

                       TWIGG

          It didn't work! The curse is still
          upon us!

Barbossa searches his mind for an answer ... turns to
Elizabeth.

                     BARBOSSA
          You. Maid. Your father. What was
          his name?!
              (grabs her roughly)
          Was your father William Turner?!

Elizabeth takes time to smile before answering:

                    ELIZABETH
          No.

The pirates cry out in alarm. Barbossa gathers himself,
getting his rage under steely control.

                    BARBOSSA
          Where's his child? The child that
          sailed from England eight years
          ago, the child who is the real
          owner of that medallion, the child
          in whose veins flows the blood of
          William Turner?! Where?

Barbossa SLAPS her hard across the face, sending her
sprawling.

                    JACOBY
              (to Pintel)
          You brought us the wrong person!

                    PINTEL
          She had the medallion! She's the
          right age. She said her name was
          Turner!

                    TWIGG
              (to Barbossa)
          You brought us here for nothing?

Barbossa whirls on him --

                    BARBOSSA

          If you had sailed with Morgan for
          ten years like I have, you'd know
          not to question me!

Elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment
unnoticed. Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above
her.

Startled, Elizabeth looks up --

-- Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down
with his scabbard for her to grab onto.

Elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied
medallion from the pile. Reaches back, grabs the scabbard.
Will pulls her up -

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          If any coward here dare challenge
          me, let him speak! Any more talk,
          I'll chain ye to a cannon and send
          ye to the watery depths!

A sound catches his attention -- coins falling. He looks
up, sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure
stack.

ATOP THE STACK, Will grabs a large shield, flings them
forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the
far side, slide through a small opening -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - SMALL CAVERN - NIGHT

Behind them, loose coins from their slide come down in an
avalanche, sealing the entrance.

Elizabeth jumps up, silver platter in hand, ready to swing
-Jack catches her before she can do any damage. They
recognize each other.

                    ELIZABETH
          You?!

                    JACK
          Me!

                    ELIZABETH
          You're in league with Barbossa!

                    JACK
          No, I'm -- rescuing you.

Elizabeth can't comprehend that one.

                      ELIZABETH
          You?!

Will gains his footing in the rubble.

                     WILL
          Miss Swann! We're here to rescue
          you!
               (sounds of pursuit,
                approaching)
          It's going badly!

                      JACK
          This way!

They race off, toward a bit of moonlight -

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

The three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the
island. Will takes Elizabeth's hand, helps her.

                    WILL
          I'm glad we got here in time.

                    ELIZABETH
          Truthfully -- you were a bit late.

                    JACK
          The trick isn't getting here, it's
          getting away.

As if on cue, they hear the yells of pirates, coming
closer. They take off -

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CLEARING - NIGHT

The three race through the rocks, the sounds of pursuit
close behind. Suddenly Jack stops.

                      ELIZABETH
          Come on!

                      JACK

          No. This won't work.
              (a quick decision)
          I'll stay behind, and fight them.
          You go on.

Will and Elizabeth stare at him.

                    WILL
          No.

                    JACK
          I'll lead them away.

The sounds are closer.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Go to the opposite end of the
          island, and signal the ship. I'll
          keep 'em busy.

                    WILL
          Are you sure? Jack -- this is not
          something you have to do.

                    JACK
          I'm sure. When you've led the kind
          of life I have, there are debts
          that must be paid. Maybe I can
          balance the scales a little.

Will nods, hesitates... gives Jack his sword - - now Jack
has two, ..one for each hand. Elizabeth gives him a quick
kiss.

Will and Elizabeth race away, and are gone.

Jack watches them for a moment, turns to face the pirates.
He sticks the two swords in the ground, crossed. Leans
casually against a rock.

A group of pirates round a corner, cutlasses drawn, ready
to fight -- but Jack raises his hand.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I invoke the right of parlay,
          according to the Code of the
          Brethren, set down by the pirates
          Morgan and Bartholomew...

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

Jack stands before Barbossa, surrounded by pirates. Jack
has a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesn't like
it.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack
          Sparrow, without so much as a
          word, if you don't lose that grin
          from your face.

Jack's smile remains. Barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass -

                    JACK
          The woman's blood didn't work, did
          it?

Barbossa hesitates.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I know who's blood you need, to
          end the curse.

                    BARBOSSA
          Say the name, or I slit your
          throat.

                    JACK
          No you won't.

Barbossa nods. Pintel steps forward, puts a blade to Jack's
throat. Jack's smile widens.

                      PINTEL
          Now?

                      BARBOSSA (NODS)
          Now.
              (Pintel grins)
          No, don't kill him.

Surprised, Pintel lowers his cutlass. Jack's expression
hasn't changed.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Allow me the humor of listening to
          your terms.

                    JACK
          Simple. I have something you want more
          than anything. The way to free you from
          the curse of the treasure. You have
          something I want -- more than anything.

                     BARBOSSA
          The Pearl?
              (laughs)
          Oh, that's fine. And just how do
          you expect this to work?

                    JACK
          You give me the Pearl. Then I tell
          you who you need.

Barbossa stares at him, incredulous.

                    BARBOSSA
          That's your offer? You, sailing
          away nice and pretty with the
          Black Pearl, and all I have is a
          name?

                    JACK
          That's right.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'm supposed to ... trust you?

The pirates laugh.

                    JACK
          I'm a man of my word.

The pirates laugh louder.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          You see, I've got this honest streak in me
          -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and
          there's the fact that you have no choice.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'll torture it out of you.

                    JACK
          You left me on a desert island --
          what worse can you do?

Jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now. Barbossa
sees his options dwindling, begins to pace.

                    BARBOSSA
          Blast you! I'll throw you in
          prison.

                    JACK
          Wait as long as you like.

                    BARBOSSA
          You're setting me up for a double
          cross, you with the ship, and me with
          nothing more than your word!

                    JACK
          Let's say I tell you the wrong
          person. What would you do?

                    BARBOSSA
          Track you down and -

He sees where Jack is headed.

                    JACK
          And if I tell you the truth, you become
          mortal, and you won't come near me
          because you know I'd kill you.

Barbossa hesitates. The pirates are amazed at how the tide
has turned; Barbossa has gone past considering the idea,
and might even do it.

                    BARBOSSA
          Jack, I don't trust you, and
          that's a fact. Never trust a
          smiling man, you can lay to that.

                    JACK
          See, that's where we're different.
          I trust you ... to do what it
          takes to get what you want.

                    BARBOSSA
          You're playing this as close to
          the edge as any man, I'll give you
          that.
              (decides, smiles)

             We might just have to sign
             articles, you and I. Jack, you're
             a pirate at heart, that's certain.

Jack nods.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             Pintel ... set sail. If this fool plan
             is to work, we'll need the medallion,
             and that means catching the ship which
             brought 'em here.

Jack is caught completely off guard. For the first time,
his smile fades.

                       JACK
             What -- you don't have the medallion?

                       BARBOSSA
             That fool woman took it. You be
             careful around her, Jack -- she's
             pretty enough, she'll steal your
             heart -- but pure evil inside.

                       JACK
             I'll watch my back.

                       BARBOSSA
             Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters,
             nice and fine ... in the brig.
                 (to Jack, a smile)
             Meaning no disrespect, of course.

Jack nods, and is taken away. Barbossa stares after him,
not hiding his mistrust.

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

At full sail, headed out to sea. Gibbs glances at Elizabeth
and Will, talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his
head.

                       GIBBS
             Two women on board? A man don't have to
             be superstitious to know that's
             trouble.

Elizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale:

                    ELIZABETH
          ... you were in danger ... so I took
          the medallion. And I've kept it ever
          since. They thought I was you, that
          they needed my blood. And it didn't
          work.

She hands him the medallion.

                    WILL
          Why would my father send this to me?

                    ELIZABETH
          To keep it away from them? No pirate
          would sail to London, for fear of
          Execution Dock.

                    WILL
          If I had known-

                    ELIZABETH
              (anticipating him)
          -- then we never would have met.

Will nods. They hold each other's gaze a moment. Will turns
away first, leans on the rail. Looks out to sea, back the
direction they came.

                    WILL
          I can't believe he would make such
          a sacrifice for us.

                    ELIZABETH
          I guess you can never truly know
          someone else's heart.

Will glances at her, and nods.

AT THE HELM, Gibbs peers forward, scanning the horizon.
There

is a tiny island in front of them.

                    GIBBS
          Shift your heading, steer clear of that
          island. Fifteen degrees starboard.

On the aft deck, Cotton concentrates on his work, securing
a halyard. Suddenly Cotton's parrot flaps its wings, takes
off, lands on the starboard bulwark, squawking -

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell
          NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!

Cotton looks up - on the horizon, following: black sails.
Gibbs and AnaMaria appear, and see the ship.

                    ANAMARIA
          Can we outrun them?

                    GIBBS
          Not a chance. Make for the reef.

EXT. CARIBBEAN OCEAN - DAY

Miles of blue water. The Interceptor tacks, leaving a long
white wake. The Black Pearl matches it -- gaining.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY

Barbossa and Pintel eye the Interceptor, two hounds chasing
the fox.

                    PINTEL
          What's he doing? Is he going to
          run her aground?

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

The Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and
the Interceptor is headed for the island.

                    GIBBS
          Drop the forward anchor!

A SAILOR at the stern of the ship pulls a release, and the

ship's anchor races down into the water, the metal chain

jumping and twisting on deck.

The chain stops, and the Sailor locks it -

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

With its forward momentum and the anchor down, the
Interceptor to turn quickly, pivoting around the anchor.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY

Barbossa and Pintel watch as the huge ship brings its
cannons to bear right in front of them.

                    BARBOSSA
          All hands! Prepare to come about!

But for now, the Interceptor has the advantage, and takes
it:

its cannons boom, and cannonballs rain down.

INT. BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY

Jack sees what he can out the porthole. In the cell with
him is Twigg, acting as a guard.

                    JACK
          Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill
          the lying scoundrel -
              (to Twigg)
          I'm a little conflicted, here.

Twigg just stares.

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Elizabeth watches  as the Black Pearl comes about -- and
then there is the  low, loud RUMBLE of two dozen cannons
firing as one. The  Interceptor is hit. A barrage of shots
follow; most find  their mark.

Sailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they
are overmatched.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - PORT SIDE - DAY

Barbossa laughs.

                    BARBOSSA
          Strike your colors, you bloody
          cockroaches!

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Another round of fire; Barbossa shows no mercy.

                    ANAMARIA
          Looks like they mean to send us under.

                    GIBBS
          There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger,

upside down.

AnaMaria, Gibbs, Cotton, even Elizabeth -- all know what
this means. Will doesn't. He looks to Gibbs for an
explanation:

                    GIBBS (CONT 'D)
          It's a signal. If we resist, it won't
          just be death. There'll be torture as
          well.

                    WILL
          We're not going to just surrender!

GIBBS That we are.

The Black Pearl fires again, a double-ball shot with a
chain connecting the two. It hits the main mast dead ani a
CRACKING, SPLINTING sound as it breaks, falls to the deck.

Barbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board.

                    WILL
          We can at least fight -- we might
          be able to kill a few-

                    GIBBS
          Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for
          Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.

Will stares -- and nods. But his expression is still
defiant.

The deck slants; the ship is sinking. pirates swarm across
on ropes, and take control of the Interceptor.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY

The top masts of the H.M.S. Interceptor sink into the
smooth' crystal waters of the Caribbean -

-- as Will and Elizabeth, held by pirates, are brought
before Barbossa -- and see that Jack stands beside him,
manacled.

Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton and the other crewmembers huddle
together.

Barbossa's wrath falls on Elizabeth.

                    BARBOSSA
          Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board,
          you played me right clever, make
          pretending and all. I hope your stay
          this time is more pleasant. Boys, show
          her some hospitality!

He shoves her into a group of pirates; they yell their
approval. She is pushed from one to another.

This goads Will to action. He head-butts the pirate behind
him, grabs a pistol, waves it at the pirates.

                    WILL
          She goes free!

Will leaps onto the ship's rail. He steadies himself with a
hand on the rigging. Points the pistol at Barbossa.

                    BARBOSSA
          What's in your head, boy?

                    WILL
          She. Goes. Free.

                    BARBOSSA
          You've got one shot -- and we can't
          die.

                    WILL
          You can't. I can.

He leans out over the ocean.

                       ELIZABETH
          No!

Jack pushes forward.

                       JACK

          Will -- don't do anything stupid!
          Don't say anything stupid -

                    WILL
          My name is Will Turner, the son of
          Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs
          in my veins.
              (raises the gun to his head)
          You need my blood. And on my word I
          will pull this trigger, and sink all
          the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!

Pintel squints at Will; the pirates murmur surprise.

                    TWIGG
          It's true - he's the spittin' image of
          old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!

Jack drops his head. Barbossa grins at him.

                    BARBOSSA
          Looks like you're back to having
          nothing to offer.

                    PINTEL
          And hers got Old Bill's courage. A
          curse on him, and you!

Barbossa steps forward.

                    BARBOSSA
          Enough of that!
              (to Will)
          Name your terms.

                    WILL
          Elizabeth goes free!

                    BARBOSSA
          We got that part. Anything else?

                    WILL
          And Jack. And the crew. Free and
          unharmed. I f you agree... then...
          I will remain with you.

Barbossa considers; his crew waits. Finally -

                    BARBOSSA

          Agreed. You have my word, as a
          gentleman of fortune -

                    ELIZABETH
          Will -- you can't trust him.

                    WILL
          You must swear by the Holy Bible.

                    BARBOSSA
          Eh? You have my word, then -- on the
          Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord
          spare my worthless soul.

Barbossa crosses himself, as do many of his men.

Will lowers the gun ... steps down -- the pirates surround
him. They snatch away the pistol.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Boatswain! Take your captives
          belowdecks. Chain them in the galley,
          and teach 'em how to row.

Gibbs, AnaMaria, Cotton and the rest are led away under
guard. Barbossa looks out to sea, toward the islet.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Hah. Look there. That's the very
          same island we made Jack governor
          of on our last trip.
              (nods")
          When you sail the open sea as long as
          I, you learn to trust the signs fate
          sends your way.

                    GIBBS
              (dejected)
          Amen to that...

                    BARBOSSA
          Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my
          word and you're to be set free, right
          quick.
              (loudly)
          Men, break out the plank!

A CHEER goes up from the pirates. Will realizes what
Barbossa intends to do, struggles with his captors.

                    WILL
          No! You gave your word!

                    BARBOSSA
          Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.
          Those as know me know I wouldn't cross
          my word, and bring down bad luck on the
          ship.
              (nods)
          I agreed to set them free. I didn't say
          when. .. nor where.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Black Pearl lies at anchor, closer now to the islet.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY

Jack, wrists still bound, stands in the classic 'walking
the plank' pose. Elizabeth is next in line. Pirates crowd
the ship's rail to watch.

                    JACK
          It's pure evil to make a Captain walk
          the plank of his own ship, twice in one
          lifetime. No good can come of it.

                    BARBOSSA
          Now, Jack. That reef is less than a
          league distant. It's a square deal all
          around, and you can't hope for better.

                    JACK
          Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.

Barbossa smiles, shows a pistol. Points it at Jack.

                    BARBOSSA
          You'd best take a swim, Jack.

                    JACK
          The last time you did this, you
          left me a pistol, with one shot.

The pirates mutter agreement.

                    PINTEL
          That's proper, sir, according to the
          code.

                    BARBOSSA
          By the Powers, you're right!
              ( turns around)
          Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got
          it? Bring it forward!

                    JACK
          A gentleman might give us two pistols,
          seeing as there are two of us, this
          time.

A pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa.

                    BARBOSSA
          Tell you what. I'll   give you one
          pistol, and let you   be the gentleman,
          an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death
          yourself!
              (grins)
          That is, presuming   you're not both drownded.

The pirates laugh. Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- but
over his head, and down into the water with a splash.

                    BARBOSSA (CONTID)
          So how did you get off that island,
          anyway?

                    JACK
          You can go to your grave not knowing.

                    BARBOSSA
          That's fair.

Jack glares at Barbossa. Then he's prodded with a cutlass,
takes a step out. Reaches the end of the plank -- steps
off.

Jack plunges down into the water. Appears on the surface,
floundering, struggles to stay afloat. Will and Elizabeth
exchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

          The lady's next. But first, I'll be
          wanting that dress back, if you please.

Elizabeth hesitates ... then strips it off, leaving her in
a silk slip. She throws it at him.

                    ELIZABETH
          Here -- it will go well with your
          black heart !

Barbossa indicates the plank.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT' D)
          I will not walk into the ocean.
          You'll have to throw me in!

Barbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods.

                    BARBOSSA
          Have at her, lads!

The pirates rush to comply. Lift her up, toss her over the
rail -- with a scream she falls --

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - UNDERWATER - DAY

We follow Elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she PLUNGES
down

through the water. Blue and clear, with streaks of sunlight
cutting down; bright coral and tropical fish, and a lovely
young woman in a silk dress. .. if it weren't for the
mortal danger, the scene could be described as gorgeous.

Elizabeth spots Jack, below her now, sinking, struggling.
She swims down ... unties his bonds.

Elizabeth starts for the surface. Inexplicably, Jack swims
the other way, further down into the depths.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

Elizabeth breaks the surface, looks around. And then,
finally Jack appears, sucking in air. He shows what he went
after: his pistol. He tucks it into his shirt.

                    ELIZABETH
          You went back for that? We need to
          head for the reef!

She starts swimming. Jack hesitates. The Black Pearl is
already underway; he stares at it.

                    JACK
          That's the second time I've had to
          watch that man sail away with my ship.

He turns away, and swims after Elizabeth.

EXT. ISLET - BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON: The surf line. Elizabeth's feet leave prints in
the sand ... and then meet up with matching footprints she
made earlier, going in the same direction. She has walked
all the way around the island.

                    JACK (O.S.)
          Not all that big, is it?

Jack lays on the beach. He has dismantled his pistol; the
parts, ball and powder dry on his scarf.

                     ELIZABETH
          Has it changed since the last time you
          were here?

                    JACK
          The trees are taller.

Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are.
He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol.

                    ELIZABETH
          I hope you have no intention of using
          that.

Jack has finished putting his pistol back together. He
shoves it in his belt, walks off.

                    JACK
          Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.

Elizabeth can't believe it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Captain Sparrow! We have to get
          off this island -- immediately!

                    JACK

          Don't be thinking I'm not already
          working on it.

He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees. Digs for
something beneath the sand. He finds it: a large iron ring.

                    ELIZABETH
          What is that? Is there a boat
          under there?

Jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit.
Inside are barrels and bottles of rum ... all covered with
dust and cobwebs, long abandoned. Jack's face falls.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          What? What's wrong? How will this
          help us get off the island?

                    JACK
          It won't. It won't, and so we
          won't.

He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum,.
takes a swig.

                    ELIZABETH
          But ... you did it before! Last
          time -

                    JACK
          Last time, I was here a grand
          total of three days. Last time,
          the rumrunners who used this
          island as a cache came by, and I
          bartered passage off.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          But from the looks of this,
          they've long been'out of business,
          and so that won't be happening
          again.
              (takes another swig)
          We probably have your friend
          Norrington to thank for that.

                    ELIZABETH
          So that's it? That's the secret
          grand adventure of the infamous

          Jack Sparrow? You spent three days
          on the beach drinking rum?

                    JACK
          Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          You should look at our contretemps
          this way: we've got shade trees,
          thank the Lord. We've got some
          food on the trees, thank the Lord
          again. And we've got rum, praise
          the Lord. We can stay alive a
          month, maybe more. Keep a weather
          eye open for passing ships, and
          our chances are fair.

                    ELIZABETH
          A month? Will doesn't have a
          month! We've got to do something
          to help him!

                    JACK
          You're right.
              (hoists the bottle)
          Here's luck to you, Will Turner.

He drinks -- and defiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze.
But then turns away, sits down.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Don't be thinking I'm happy about
          this, Elizabeth. But I see no use
          in wailing and gnashing my teeth
          over that which I can do nothing
          about.

                    ELIZABETH
          Not when you can drink instead, at
          least.

Jack tosses her a bottle.

                    JACK

          Try it. It goes down rough, but it
          goes down - - and the second swig
          goes down easier.

Elizabeth considers. Comes to a decision. She unseals the
bottle, takes a swig. They sit in silence for a bit.

                    ELIZABETH
          And you will call me Miss Swann.

Jack toasts her: you got it. Elizabeth studies her
bottle... gives Jack a sidelong glance. Back to her bottle
...

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (under her breath)
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho...

                    JACK
          What? What was that?
              (Elizabeth smiles)
          Something funny, Miss Swann? share.
          Please,

                    ELIZABETH
          Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ...
          I'm reminded of a song I learned
          as a child. A song about pirates.

                    JACK
          I know a lot of songs about pirates,
          but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear
          it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Oh, no ... it's silly.   Back in
          England we didn't know   a thing
          about pirates, really.   They seemed
          so romantic and daring   -

Jack likes the way that sounds.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (looks at him)
          That was before I met one, of
          course.

                    JACK

          Now I must hear this song. An
          authentic pirate song. Have at it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Well, perhaps ... with a bit more
          to drink, I might ...

                    JACK
          More to drink!

He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. She drops
her half-finished bottle to catch it. Opens it, takes a
sip.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Well?

Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self-
consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on.

                    ELIZABETH
          We pillage, we plunder, we rifle,
          we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo
          ho.

She gestures for him to drink. He does.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          We kidnap and ravage and we don't
          give a hoot, Drink up me hearties,
          yo ho -

EXT. ISLET - BEACH - LATER - NIGHT

The middle of the night. A fire BLAZES. Jack and Elizabeth
are roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the way
up to the stars --

                    JACK/ELIZABETH
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for
          me!

Yo ho, yo ho, it's a pirates life for me!

                    JACK
          I LOVE this song!
              (sings)
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for
          me! We're beggars and blighters,

          ne'er do well cads, Drink up me
          hearties, yo ho!
              (gives it a touch of
               Irish ballad)
          Aye but we're loved by our mums and our
          dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!

They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks. He drains
the bottle, then tosses it away.

                    JACK   (CONT'D)
          When I get the   Black Pearl back, I'm
          going to teach   it to the whole crew,
          and we'll sing   it all the time!

                    ELIZABETH
          You'll be positively the most fearsome
          pirates to sail the Spanish Main.

Elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle. Jack doesn't
have a bottle to salute back. She hands him hers. He
drinks, then settles shakily to the ground. Elizabeth sits
beside him.

                    JACK
          Not just the Spanish Main. The whole
          ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we
          want to go, we go. That's what a ship
          is, you know. Not just a keel and a
          hull and a deck and sails. That's what
          a ship need_ ... but what a ship is --
          what the Black Pearl really-is ... is
          freedom.

Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder.

                    ELIZABETH
          Jack, it must be so terrible for you,
          to be trapped here on this island, all
          over again.

                    JACK
          Ah, well... the company is better
          than last time. And the scenery
          has definitely improved.

                      ELIZABETH
              (coy)

          Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had
          enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

                    JACK
          We've got a few bottles left ...
          and we've yet to tap the kegs.

Elizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile.
She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up.

                    ELIZABETH
          To freedom.

                    JACK
          To the Black Pearl.

They tap the bottles together. Elizabeth feigns a drink as
he chugs. He taps his bottle against her again. She laughs,
feigns another drink -

EXT. ISLET - BEACH - MORNING

CLOSE ON -- JACK'S FACE, dead asleep, lying in the
sunlight. His nose twitches. A bit of SMOKE drifts by. His
nose twitches again. His eyes open.

Jack GROANS and sits up. He rubs his head, looks over -

-- all of the foliage in the middle of the island is ON
FIRE. Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky.

Jack leaps to his feet. He sees Elizabeth, as she pours out
the last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a
palm tree. It goes up in FLAMES. She rolls the barrel
forward -- it starts to BURN merrily.

Jack can't believe his eyes.

                    JACK
          What are you doing? You've burned
          our food, the shade -- the rum!

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, the rum is gone.

She wipes her hands together. One of the rum barrels in the
fire EXPLODES.

                    JACK

          Why?

                    ELIZABETH
          One, because it is a vile drink that
          turns even the most respectable men
          into scoundrels. Two -

She points to the sky.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          That signal is over a thousand feet
          high, which means it can be seen for
          two hundred leagues in every direction.
          The entire Royal Navy is out to sea
          looking for me -- do you think there is
          even a chance they could mass it?

                    JACK
          You -- you burned up the island, for a
          one-time chance at being spotted?

                     ELIZABETH
          Exactly.

Elizabeth turns toward the sea.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Just you wait, Captain. In an hour,
          maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open'
          and you'll be seeing white sails on
          that horizon!

She sits down, determined. Shields her eyes, scans the
water, waiting, searching. Jack is speechless. He throws up
his hands, stalks up the sand dune, just to get away from
her.

EXT. ISLET - LEEWARD SHORE - DAY

At the crest of the dune, Jack stops -- and stares,
incredulous. We come around to see what he is looking at -

Past Jack, anchored the other side of the island, white
sails glorious against the turquoise waters, is the H.M.S.
Dauntless. A longboat is already being rowed toward them.

Jack shakes his head.

                     JACK

          They'll be no living with her
          after this.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - DAY

Norrington gives Elizabeth a hand disembarking from the
raised long boat.

                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth, I'm" relieved you're
          safe.
              (re: Jack)
          Clap him in irons. And behind his
          back this time.

                    ELIZABETII
          Commodore, you can't do that!

                    NORRINGTON
          You're speaking up for him again?

                    ELIZABETH
          He can locate Isla de Muerta --
          but I doubt he'll be willing to
          help us from the brig.

                    JACK
              (she's right)
          We had time to get to know each other.

                    NORRINGTON
          We are bound for Port Royal, not
          Isla de Muerta.

                    ELIZABETH
          No. The pirates have taken Will -

                    NORRINGTON
          Your father is frantic with worry.
          Our mission was to rescue you and
          return home. That is what we shall
          do. Mr. Turner's fate is
          regrettable. But so was his
          decision to engage in piracy.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, please!

                    JACK

          Norrington, think about it ... the
          Black Pearl, its captain and
          crew... the last pirate threat in
          the Caribbean. How can you pass
          that up?

                    NORRINGTON
          By remembering that I serve
          others, not only myself.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, I beg you -- please do
          this ... for me. As a wedding
          gift.

                    NORRINGTON
          I am to understand that you will
          accept my marriage proposal on the
          condition I rescue Mr. Turner?

                    ELIZABETH
          Not as a condition -- a request.

Norrington considers. To Gillette:

                    NORRINGTON
          Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to
          come about. He'll give you our heading.

Gillette unlocks Jack's manacles. Jack raises an eyebrow.

                    JACK
          Congratulations, sir.

Crew men lead Jack toward the bridge. Sailors go about
their tasks, and the ship begins its slow turn.

                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my
          proposal.

                    ELIZABETH
          What?

                    NORRINGTON
          I know now where your heart truly
          lies.

Elizabeth looks at Norrington, seeing him in a new light.

                    ELIZABETH
          And now I know... where yours
          does, as well.

They gaze at each other for a moment. Norrington looks
away.

                    NORRINGTON
          You may seclude yourself in my
          cabin. I'm afraid we do not have
          any ladies' clothing aboard.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then I can wear men's clothing.

                    NORRINGTON
          That would hardly be proper.

                    ELIZABETH
          Well, I am not going to stay
          hidden in a some cabin, 80 I
          suppose it's going to be heaving
          bosoms and bare ankles for the
          remainder of the voyage!

Norrington is exasperated, but then can't help but grin -
this is exactly why he loves her. She grins back at him -
she's not going to change.

                    NORRINGTON
          Murtogg, take our guest below, and find
          her some trousers, and a shirt.

Elizabeth smiles, allows herself to be escorted away.
Norrington watches her go ... then turns his gaze to the
sea.

INT. THE BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY

Pintel enters the cell. It appears empty -- but that's
because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove
up the ceiling planks with his legs.

                    PINTEL
          That ain't going to work. That's the
          gun deck above yea

Will drops lightly to the deck. Suddenly:

                    WILL
          What happened to William Turner?

                    PINTEL
          Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He
          threw in with us after we relieved Jack
          Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned
          out, it never sat well with him-
          particularly after we found Cortes'
          treasure, and its peculiar condition.
          He thought we deserved to be cursed,
          for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we
          did. That's why he sent off a piece of
          the treasure -- to you, as it were: so
          it would never be recovered, and so
          cursed we_ remain.

                    WILL
          And then he ran. And he's hiding out
          someplace where you haven't been able
          to find him.

                    PINTEL
          That's a nice thought, to be sure, and
          I wager your da wishes he'd thought it
          hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done,
          _ didn't sit too well with Captain
          Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to
          his legs and dumped him over.

Will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate.

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill,
          was his face looking up, as he
          sank down to the crushing black
          oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.
              (sighs)
          It was only after, we found out we
          needed his blood to solve the curse.
          That's what you call ironic.

Barbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several other
pirates. He regards Will for a moment, then:

                       BARBOSSA
          Bring him.

EXT. H. M.. S.. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - EVENING

Jack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at
the sea. Elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to
excellent effect, joins him.

                    ELIZABETH
          You didn't tell Commodore Norrington
          everything.

                    JACK
          Nor did you, I noticed.

                    ELIZABETH
          He might delay the rescue ... and
          that would be too late.

                     JACK
          Exactly.

                    ELIZABETH
          These men will be facing an enemy
          that seemingly cannot be killed.

                     JACK
          I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any
          battle will be decidedly brief ... and
          one-sided.

                    ELIZABETH
          What's your plan?

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
          LAND HO!

Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon.

                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth -- below decks. I will
          not compromise your safety..

She starts to speak; he turns away..

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my
          quarters, and make sure she stays
          there.

Norrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island. Jack
watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I don't like the situation, mister
          Sparrow. The island is riddled
          with caves. I will not put my men
          at a disadvantage.

                    JACK
          Funny, I was thinking   along those lines.
          How about you let me   go in alone, and
          while you're setting   up an ambush, I'll
          trick the pirates out   to you.

                    NORRINGTON
          You would do that?

                    JACK
          They left me stranded. Twice. What
          have you got to lose?

                    NORRINGTON
              (looks at him)
          Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid
          of.

                    JACK
              (smiles)
          I knew you'd listen to reason!

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

Torches are lit. Barbossa leads Will, guarded by Pintel and
a band of pirates, into the caves.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

A long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side. Jack
wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch.

                    JACK
          That chart I drew up'11 get you
          past the reefs. If you're
          steersman's good enough, that is.

                    NORRINGTON
          I'll be at the wheel myself.

                    JACK
          I'll slip in, talk them into to come
          out, and you'll be free to blow holy
          high heaven the whole lot of them.

The crewmen release the lines, and the boat drops -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

The pirate group moves deeper into the caves. Will moves
along unwillingly.

                    PINTEL
          No reason to fret. It's just a prick of
          the finger and a few drops of blood.

                     BARBOSSA
          Turner blood doesn't flow pure in
          his veins.
              (grins)
          Best play it safe, and spill it all.

                    PINTEL
          I guess there is a reason to fret.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

The Dauntless drifts into the lagoon. Norrington and his
men prepare to go ashore.     h

INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

Lit by torchlight. Will notices: a crack runs between the
floor and the wall of the cave, widening into a ravine.

                    BARBOSSA
          Careful, now. You could fall in and
          still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.

Will makes a decision. He intentionally stumbles. Pintel

shoves him forward -- Will continues forward, grabs the
pirate in front of him, swings him into the wall of the
cave. Catches the pirate's torch, and uses it to ward off
the others.

                    WILL
          You deserve to be cursed -- and
          remain cursed!

He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine. The wall
of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope; Will hits it,
and tumbles down, disappears into black.

                    BARBOSSA
          Blast him! A pox on him, and his
          father, and the whole damnable
          line! Fan out! Find him!

INT. DAUNTLESS - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out the Captain's small porthole -- sees
boats laden with Navy men headed for shore.

She turns away from the porthole, wishing there was
something she could do. Suddenly there is a flutter at the
window--

Cotton's parrot is there.

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me
          hearties yo ho!

The bird flutters off; Elizabeth races to the porthole, and
then to the stern window to see it flyaway.

She looks down -- and there, fastened to the stern of the
ship, is a small rowboat.

INT. ISLA DEMUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

Will races forward, turning this way and that. He sees a
light ahead, heads for it, turns a corner -

-- and runs straight into Jack.

                    JACK
          Do you have any idea where you're
          going?

                    WILL
          Jack!

                    JACK
          Don't talk. These caves magnify
          sound. Just follow me.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA -       THE BEACH - NIGHT

Norrington and men land on the beach, and spread out. They
silently take up positions around the main cave entrance.

INT. CAVES - NIGHT

Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops,
staring. Will is a few steps behind.

                    WILL
          Are you certain this is the right way?

                    JACK
          It's the right way.

Will join him -- and see what Jack is staring at:

Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly

endless. At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the
stone Aztec chest.

                    BARBOSSA
          Thank you, Jack Sparrow.

The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked
by his men. The trio whirl to run - - more pirates emerge
from hiding. Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is
there.

The pirates grab Will and Jack. Will struggles, but Jack
does not fight at all.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You couldn't have led him back
          more directly if you knew exactly
          where you were going.

He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest. The pirates
follow, dragging Will and Jack with them.

                     WILL
          You did know where you were going!
          You did lead us directly to them!
               (Jack's silence confirms it)
          Why?

Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest.
Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the
moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck.

He picks up the stone knife.

                    BARBOSSA
          What was begun by blood, let blood now
          end!

He raises the knife to Will's throat -

                    JACK
          You don't want to be doing that.

Barbossa pretends to think about his words.

                    BARBOSSA
          No, I really think I do.

                    JACK
              (shrugs)
          All right then.

That makes Barbossa pause. He steps out of the moonlight.

                    BARBOSSA
          Why don't I want to do this?

                    JACK
          Because, right about now, the H.M.S.
          Dauntless is lying in wait in the
          harbor.

                    WILL
          Jack!

                    JACK
          - - and its guns and crew will cut you
          and your men to pieces the moment you
          step outside these caves.

A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates.

                    PINTEL
          Do you believe him?

                    BARBOSSA
          No.
              (indicates Will)
          But him I believe. He is genuinely
          angry.

                    JACK
          You've no hope of surviving
          Norrington's attack ... that is, if
          you're mortal.

                    BARBOSSA
          What're you suggesting?

Jack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward
Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins.

                    JACK
          Simple. Don't kill the boy yet.
          Wait for a more opportune moment.

Will glares, listening to every word he says. Jack scoops
up a handful of coins from the chest.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (drops the coins one-by-
               one back into the chest)
          Like after you've killed... Every...
          Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.

                    BARBOSSA
          I can't help wondering, Jack, why
          you're being so helpful and all? Last
          time you did that, it didn't end 80
          well for you.

                    JACK
          The situation has changed.

                     BARBOSSA
          That so?

                    JACK
          Aye. See, after you're done with the
          Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a
          problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There
          you'll be, with two lovely ships on
          your hands, and what to do? Of course
          you'll decide you deserve the bigger
          one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless
          a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it,
          you can rule the seas.
              (beat)

          But if you're Captain of the Dauntless,
          who's left for the Black Pearl?

Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me.

                     JACK (CONT'D)
          I sail for you as part of your fleet, I
          give you fifteen percent of my plunder,
          and you get to introduce yourself at
          tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore
          Barbossa.'
              (sticks out his hand)
          Do we have an accord?

Barbossa licks his lips. It's tempting ...

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Now, you can take care of the
          Dauntless, right?

                    BARBOSSA
          Men! Are you up for it?

The pirates yell to the affirmative.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Mr. Pintel, select five men to
          stay here. Take the rest of the
          men out ... not through the caves.

Jack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for.

                    JACK
          There's ... another exit?

                    BARBOSSA
          Aye, for us there is.

EXT. LAGOON - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Moonlight shines down into the shallow waters, brightening
coral, sparkling over the rippled sand floor.

Suddenly all the fish SCATTER. Briefly, the waters are
empty.

And then FIGURES appear in the distance, seeming to waver
in the shifting current. They scuffle forward, kicking up
clouds of sand --

The figures resolve into the skeleton PIRATES, moving
silently across the lagoon floor, swords glinting. The
tatters of their clothing drift in the water. Their skull
heads are fixed in an endless grin.

The LEAD PIRATE glides forward -

And stops next to a huge iron ANCHOR -- twice his' height,
even buried halfway into the sand. A heavy CHAIN with
barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface -

A SHADOW falls across the Lead Pirate -- he TRANSFORMS, and
we see that it is Pintel. He looks up -

Above, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of
the H.M.S. Dauntless, silhouetted by moonlight.

The huge shift drifts, again spilling moonlight below -

And the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again
SKELETONS, staring with upturned faces. The Pintel-skeleton
puts a knife between his teeth, starts to crawl up the iron
rings.

Other pirates crowd forward, and soon the anchor-chain is
clustered with skeletons -

EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT

Elizabeth has the small boat out, and rows away from the
Dauntless, looking ahead over her shoulder. Cotton's parrot
is nowhere to be seen.

In the distance, Pintel breaks the surface near the
Dauntless, intent on climbing the anchor; he looks over -

Just as Elizabeth rounds the point, and rocks obscure the
small longboat from view.

More skeleton-pirates appear, and Pintel continues his
climb.

EXT. LAGOON - DAUNTLESS - NIGHT

Two SAILORS, alert and vigilant, stare out toward shore.
The island reveals nothing but blackness.

There is a scurrying sound -- bones scraping against wood -
and the sailors JUMP. They listen, intently -- nothing.

                    TALL SAILOR
          Ship rats. Big ones.

                    SHORT SAILOR
              (nods)
          Hate those things.

They turn back toward the island, continue their vigil. A
long pause.

                    SHORT SAILOR (CONT'D)
          Taste all right, though.

                    TALL SAILOR
          That they do.

From behind, the two sailors at the rail are well-lit by a
lantern. Suddenly shadows appear, skeletons, climbing up
the sailor's backs. -MOVE CLOSER and then the skeletons
appear, reaching -- the two sailors are grabbed from behind
-

EXT. DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT

Two bodies are tossed out over the rail, hit the water with
a splash.

EXT. DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT

Pintel looks down into the water, satisfied. Puts away his
knife. Notices, pulls out a long piece of seaweed from his
rib cage. Tosses it. Turns to the others.

                    PINTEL
          Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns
          on the beach, and set your aim. Wait
          for my signal, we don't want to spook
          them.

The pirates hurry to comply -

EXT. LAGOON - BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

Elizabeth rounds the point further, and sees: the Black
Pearl, anchored in the neighboring cove. A fleck of color -
Cotton's parrot, as it darts in through a porthole.

Elizabeth slows her efforts, silently approaching the ship.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Four PIRATES -- who really ought to be keeping watch -

instead have gathered wine bottles and rum casts into a
pile, along apples, biscuits -- all the food on the ship.

They act out a mock-feast, in anticipation of the curse
being lifted. A SKINNY skeleton offers two bottles BIG
BONED

skeleton.

                      SKINNY
            Which would you prefer first, good
            sir -rum, or wine?

                      BIG-BONES
            I believe I'll have a spot o' rum, if
            you don't mind, and thank'ee kind sir!

They burst out laughing -- a hideous sound that wheezes
through their bones.

Behind them, unnoticed, Elizabeth peeks cautiously around a
corner. She picks her moment and sneaks past quickly, down
a gangway, disappearing into the blackness of the ship.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Gillette crouches, running low behind a line of rocks. He
reports to Norrington:

                      GILLETTE
            All the men in place, sir. Ready to
            fire.

                      NORRINGTON
            Wait for my order -- what the blazes is
            that?

It's the sound of cannon fire -- coming from the Dauntless.
Cannonballs hit the shore; men cry out in anguish.

                      NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
            Men! Take cover!

The sailors scramble to find refuge -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

Will, guarded by pirates, glares at Jack.

                    WILL
          You've been planning this from the
          beginning. Since you learned my name.

Jack takes the opportunity to move toward him.

                    JACK
          Oh, please -- do I really seem that
          clever?

Before Will can answer, Jack smoothly slips the sword from
a Pirate's scabbard -- tosses it to Will, who catches it
despite his surprise.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Use it well.

He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate. Barbossa
and the other pirates stare in shock -

                    BARBOSSA
          Confound it, Jack -- I was
          actually beginning to like you!

Swords are drawn, and the Pirates attack.

Jack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own
style: Will parries, glissades and disarms with lightning
fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists,
acrobatics and anything within reach to survive.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

The sailors charge. The moon emerges from behind a cloud -

Suddenly army of SKELETON PIRATES rise up from the sea, and
charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down -

                    NORRINGTON
          Steady, men! Remember -- we're the
          Navy!

The sailors recover their nerve, and engage the enemy. It's
a full on battle, Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates -

The Navy men are driven back, surrounded -

Suddenly there is a massive BOOM of cannon fire.
Norrington, in the midst of a swordfight, tries to see -

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          What is happening out there?

EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT

It's the Black Pearl, manned by Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton,
and captained by Elizabeth, coming around the point,
cannons blazing.

EXT. H.M. S. DAUNTLESS - NIGHT

The pirates on the ship are caught by surprise, try to turn
their cannons to this new foe -

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Gillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless.

                    GILLETTE
          They're on our side! Take heart, men!

The Royal Navy stand their ground and fight -

INT. CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - NIGHT

Only two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby. Jacoby rounds
on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack.

                    BARBOSSA
          Just so you know, Jack -- I don't
          think you're that clever. I think
          you're a fool. A mortal fool.

                    JACK
          Remarkable how often those two
          traits coincide.

Jack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh.

                    BARBOSSA
          You can't beat me, Jack.

To prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches
Jack's sword with both hands. Jack can't free it. Barbossa
twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it -

- - AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACK'S CHEST.

Will battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the
jaw, crumpling him

                    WILL
          Jack!

Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He
takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when
he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOME SKELETAL.

                    JACK
          Well, isn't that interesting.

Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls
something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          They're so pretty, I just couldn't
          resist stealing one. It's a curse,
          I guess.

Barbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are
in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle.

                    BARBOSSA
          So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we
          to be two immortals, locked in
          epic battle until the trumpets of
          Judgment Day?

                    JACK
          Or you could surrender.

He shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa
stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack.

                    BARBOSSA
          Or I could chain you to a
          cannonball and drop you in the
          deepest part of the ocean, where
          you can contemplate your folly
          forever.

Barbossa charges -

A SHOT RINGS OUT -

Jack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again,
holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa.

                     BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Hah. Ten years you carried that
          pistol, and you end up wasting
          your shot.

                    WILL
          He didn't waste it.

Will stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword,
his left hand in a fist. He opens the fist -

-- the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand,
revealing the cut in his palm.

Barbossa stares, then looks down at his chest. Blood
blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreads
quickly.

Barbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for
the first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to the
ground, dead.

Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol...
tosses it away.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Murtogg FIRES a pistol at a pirate. The pirate is hit,
screams in pain, and crumples to the ground. Mullroy runs
through another with his sword.

The pirates react to the sight, and quickly realize their
peril. They set their weapons down in surrender.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHT

The Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless, and Jack's
crew swarm across, overwhelming the pirates.

The sailors on the beach see it, and CHEER.

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

Will wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near the
chest.

                    WILL
          Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever
          heard of.
              (smiles)
          You're a man who can be trusted, who
          can be counted on, and who can It
          betray his friends. What kind of pirate
          is that?

                     JACK
              (admits it)
          The worst.
              (beat)
          On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who
          can't pass up a chance for revenge
          against the black-hearted bastard who
          stole my ship and left me to die in the
          middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and
          who knows how to get what he wants. Now
          that's a great pirate.

Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest
... and then hesitates.

Will looks at him...

Jack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside the
other bloody coin.

Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT.
Elizabeth stares at it.

                    WILL
          Let's get out of here.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Jack, Will, and Norrington gather together on the beach.
Elizabeth calls out:

                    ELIZABETH
          You're all right!

The three men turn as one. An awkward moment -- which of
them does she mean?

Elizabeth races across the sand, toward them -- and
straight to Will. She throws her arms around his neck in a
hug.

                    WILL
          Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers?
          And how did you get off the island?

Elizabeth can't believe that's what he noticed. Indignant,
she steps away from him.

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for
          how we got off the island -- ah, that's
          a grand adventure, but now is not the
          time to talk about it.

She reaches a hand behind his neck, decisively kisses him.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          There. And don't you dare tell me
          that wasn't a proper kiss!

                    WILL
          Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter-
          that we are of a different class -

                    ELIZABETH
          It doesn't!

                    WILL
          -- but that was not a proper kiss.

Pure consternation on Elizabeth's face -

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          This is a proper kiss.

Will sweeps her in his arms, leans her back, and kisses her
long and well -

Jack puts a hand on Norrington's shoulder.

                    JACK
          Tough luck. I was rooting for you.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - FORT CHARLES - DAY

Close on: Will's face, stoic, staring forward. He stands
straight and unmoving. Around him are members of the Royal
Navy, standing before for a group of witnesses from town.

It is the courtyard on the top of Fort Charles. A trial is
underway -- with Will as the defendant.

                      NORRINGTON
          ...and though I do say so with
          regret, the law is clear. The
          penalty for piracy is death by
          hanging.

In the crowd, Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father,
Swann. She lets go as Swann stands.

                    SWANN
          By your leave, I wish to speak on
          behalf of the boy.
              (a glance at Elizabeth)
          It is clear that these deeds were
          performed out of a sincere desire   to do
          good, at great personal risk. It   seems
          to me, that in the rare occasion   where
          the right course is committing an   act
          of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the
          right course!
              (cheers of approval)
          So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend
          to grant a pardon to --

                    GILLETTE
          Sir!

All eyes turn. Gillette stands at the top of a stairway.

                    GILLETTE (CONT'D)
          Jack and his crew have escaped!
              (gasps from the crowd)
          There was no damage to the cell ...
          they must have been set free.

Will and Elizabeth exchange looks. You? Not me, you? No,
not me either! Swann notices something the parapet, points
-

                    SWANN
          The Black Pearl!

People rush to the parapet. Sure enough, below in the bay
are the distinctive black sails of the Pearl. The ship cuts
through the waters very close to the point -

-- where the gallows of the pirates are. Suddenly Jack
appears, on the point; he swings off the one empty
gallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as it
passes.

                    GILLETTE
          Sir! Shall I break out the
          cannons?

                    NORRINGTON
          I don't think that will be necessary.

Norrington raises his hand ... twirls a key on his finger.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          A day's head start. That's all he gets.

Will, Elizabeth and Swann look out toward ocean-

EXT. BLACK PEARL - STERN DECK - DAY

Jack monkeys down the rigging. AnaMaria is at the wheel.

                    ANAMARIA
          Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl
          is yours!

Jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail, then takes the
wheel. It feels good -- right -- in his hands. He enjoys
it, and then shifts to 'Captain' mode.

                    JACK
          AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!

                    ANAMARIA
          Aye, aye, sir!

                    JACK
          Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -
          you and Cotton. I want every inch of
          the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!

Gibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute.

Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and all
is right with the world. He begins to unconsciously hum:
"Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me ..."

He realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takes
over as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters ... and
we FADE UP large words in script:

                    THE END

                         the question I asked.

                         is *also* death. Perhaps you remember

                         Captain, I think the crew, meaning me 
                         as well, were expecting something a 
                         bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla 
                         de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed 
                         by the sea, and the treasure with it.

                         we did a speck of honest pirating.

                         Is that how you're all feeling, then? 
                         Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving 
                         your best interests as captain?

                         Do not blame the bird. Show us what 
                         is on that piece of cloth there. 
 
                         
               [the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]

                         Ohhh!

               [Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol 
               misfires]
 
               [Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey 
               while it's on the deck]

               the rigging]

                         It does me.

               [Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]

                         It's a key!

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* 
                         of a key. 
 
               [Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]

               [Among the crew:
                 Chinese man, black man with a black 
                 beard, white bearded man with large 
                 black hat]
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Gentlemen, what do keys do?

                                     LEECH
                         Keys... unlock... *things*? 

                                     GIBBS
                         And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* 
                         there's something valuable. So, we're 
                         setting out to find whatever this key 
                         unlocks!
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         No! If we don't have the key, we can't 
                         open whatever it is we don't have that 
                         it unlocks. So what purpose would be 
                         served in finding whatever need be unlocked, 
                         which we don't have, without first having 
                         found the key what unlocks it?
 
                                     GIBBS
                         So - We're going after this key!

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You're not making any sense at all. 
                         Any more questions?
 
                                     MARTY
                         So... Do we have a heading?

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... 
                          a general... in *that* way - direction.

                         Cap'n? 

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Come on, snap to and make sail, you 
                         know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, 
                         ?oy/?quick, hey!

                         Have you noticed lately... The captain 
                         seems to be actin' a bit strange... 
                         -er.

                         headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. 
                         Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack 
                         Sparrow bodes ill for us all.

                         of your services.  We wish for you to 
                         act as our agent in a business transaction 
                         with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
 
                         
                                     WILL TURNER
                         More acquaintance than friend. How do 
                         you know him?
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         We've had dealings in the past.  And 
                         we've each left our mark... on the other. 
                         
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         What mark did he leave on you? 

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set 
                         free. I would like you to go to him, 
                         and recover a certain property in his 
                         possession.

                         Recover. At the point of a sword?

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         *Bargain*!

               [Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
 
               
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Letters of Marque. You will offer what 
                         amounts to a full pardon. Jack will 
                         be free, a privateer in the employ of 
                         England.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment 
                         the same as being free.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                          Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. 
                          The world is shrinking, the blank pages 
                         of the map filled in. Jack must find 
                         his place in the new world or perish. 
                         Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and 
                         your fiancée face the hangman's noose.

                         So you get both Jack *and* the Black 
                         Pearl.

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         A ship? Hardly. The item in question's 
                         considerably smaller and far more valuable. 
                         Something Sparrow keeps on his person 
                         at all times. A compass.  Ah, you know 
                         it. Bring back that Compass, or there's 
                         no deal.

                         only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you 
                         hope to *save* me from an evil fate. 
                         But you mustn't worry. I care not for 
                         cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not 
                         so provincial. There's more than one 
                         chest of value in these waters. So perhaps

                         Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's 
                         freedom, then? I'll still want that 
                         Compass. Consider that in your calculations.

                         *captain* nonetheless! Have you not 
                         introduced yourself all these years

                         heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at 
                         least four... maybe three and a half. 
                         And did I happen to mention... he's 
                         in love. With a girl. Due to be married. 
                         Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and 
                         her from him... would only be half as 
                         cruel as actually allowing them be joined 
                         in holy matrimony. Aye?

                         But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live 
                         with this? Can you condemn an innocent 
                         man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of 
                         servitude, in your name while you roam 
                         free?

                          Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal 
                         it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?

                         It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing 
                         fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help 
                         us, pilotage. Are we all to work for

                         I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only 
                         free port left in these waters.

                         A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, 
                         I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what 
                         I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep 
                         well each night, thank you.

                         I don't need your help!

                         So I'm to understand what *you* did 
                         was an act of compassion?

                         I've sworn no oath.

                                     WILL TURNER
                         Not until I find this. The key.

               [Wyvern's eyes open in the coral-encrusted wall at the mention 
               of the key]
 
               [Wyvern, who is part of the wall, breaks his head away from the 
               wall, leaving his brains behind]
 
                                     WYVERN
                         The deadman's chest.

                                     WILL TURNER
                         What do you know of this?

                                     WYVERN
                         Open the chest with the key, and stab 
                         the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the 
                         heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, 
                         or there'll be no captain. And if there's 
                         no captain, there's no one to have the 
                         key.

                         So the captain has the key.

               [Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too 
               much]

                         Where is the chest?

                                     WYVERN
                         Hidden.

                         I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first 
                         and only love is the sea.

                         You know, these clothes do not flatter 
                         you at all. It should be a dress or 
                         nothing. I happen to have no dress in 
                         my cabin.

                         Jack. I know Will came to find you. 
                         Where is he?
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Darling, I am truly unhappy to have 
                         to tell you this but... through an unfortunate 
                         and *entirely* unforeseeable series 
                         of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever 
                         to do with me, poor William has been 
                         press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.

                         Oh, please. The captain of the Flying 
                         Dutchman.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                          You look bloody awful. What are you 
                         doing here?
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         You *hired* me. I can't help it if your 
                         standards are lax.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You *smell* funny.

                         Jack. All I want is to find Will.

                         Are you certain? Is that what you really 
                         want most?

                         find a way to *save* Will the most.

                         Well, there is a chest...

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Oh, dear.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         A chest of unknown size and origin.

                         What contains the still-beating heart 
                         o' Davy Jones.

                         And whoever possesses that chest possesses 
                         the leverage to command Jones to do 
                         whatever it is he or she wants, including... 
                         saving brave William from his grim fate.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         True enough. This Compass does not point 
                         north.

                         It points to the thing you want most 
                         in this world.

                         most in this world is to find the chest 
                         of Davy Jones, is it not?

                         of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally

                         to do because you want it. To act on 
                         selfish impulse. You want to see what 
                         it's like. One day, you won't be able

                         will come a moment when you have a chance 
                         to show it. To do the right thing.

                         something courageous. And when you do,

               nearby on a sandy slope] 
 
               [while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they 
               brush off sand to reveal a chest]
 
               [they remove the chest from the sand]

               [the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller 
               chest, among other things]
 
               [Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to 
               herself]

               they hear a heartbeat]

                         You actually *were* telling the truth.

                         I do that quite a lot. Yet people are 
                         always surprised.

               them]

                         Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came 
                         to find you!

                         Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped 
                         to my feet.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Not so easy, is it?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         But I do owe you thanks, Jack.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You do?

                         After you tricked me onto that ship 
                         to square your debt with Jones.
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         What?

                                     JACK SPARROW
                          What?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         I was reunited with my father.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                          Everything you said to me... every 
                         word, was a lie!
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Pretty much. Time and tide, love.  
 
                         
               [Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oy! What're you doing?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         I'm gonna kill Jones.

               [Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause 
                         if Jones is dead, who's to call his 
                         terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. 
                         If you please: The key.
 
               [Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, 
               points it at Jack]
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         I keep the promises I make, Jack. I 
                         intend to free my father. I hope you're 
                         here to see it.
 
               [Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]

                                     NORRINGTON
                         I can't let you do that, either. So 
                         sorry.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                          I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

                         Lord Beckett desires the contents of 
                         that chest. I deliver it, and get my 
                         life back.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Ah. The dark side of ambition.

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise 
                         of redemption.
 
               

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Stop it!

                         start *banging* away at each other!

                         don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think 
                         he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old 
                         Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his 
                         own skin. And Turner there - I figure 
                         'e's tryna... settle some unresolved 
                         business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed 
                         pirate father.

                         Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n 
                         a shiny penny. 
 
                                     RAGETTI
                         Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.

                         If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd 
                         remove temptation from their path.
 
                         
               [Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]

               chest]

               is flung onto the ground below]

                         ruined my life.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Be my guest.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Let us examine that claim for a moment, 
                         former Commodore, shall we? Who was 
                         it, who at the very moment you had a 
                         notorious pirate safely behind bars, 
                         saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take 
                         your dearly beloved all to hisself, 
                         hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, 
                         that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand 
                         what takes orders from pirates?
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         Enough!

               [Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to 
               Will]

                         Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's

               his neck]

               towards Jack]

               inside of the wheel]

               inside the rolling wheel]

                         My prayers be with him. Best not wallow 
                         in our grief. The bright side is: You're 
                         back. And made it off free and clear.

                         Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you 
                         slimy git? Look what I got.  I got a 
                         jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And 
                         guess what's inside it?

               holes in the Black Pearl]

                         Against the wind the Dutchman beats 
                         us. That's how she takes her prey. But 
                         *with* the wind...

                         Why fight when you can negotiate? All 
                         one needs... is the proper leverage.

                         Along with its captain.

                         less bright. He fooled us all right 
                         to the end. But I guess that honest

                   From the Screenplay by

                       W. Peter Iliff










FADE IN:

We are in the belly of a wave.
Light refracts in a constant collision of water.
SLOW MOTION, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid
diamonds taking flight, dreamlike...


EXT.  OCEAN - DUSK

Backlit against a flaming sun a solitary SURFER glides
across the green glassy peak.  TIME IS STRETCHED until his
movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world.
Total Zen concentration.  Body weight centered, eyes
forward and on the next section.


EXT.  URBAN STREET - DUSK

SLOW MOTION ON a black sedan.
Creeping along store fronts.  Past a Winchell's.
PEOPLE splash steps down rain-washed sidewalks in DREAM
MOTION.  The sedan turns past the FIRST VIRGINIA BANK and
into an alley.


INT.  BLACK SEDAN

TWO MEN and ONE WOMAN in SUSPENDED TIME put on overcoats
and hats.  Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch
taut from the base of their nose to their forehead,
hideously distorting their features.  Makes them look like
human PIGS.


EXT.  OCEAN

SILVERY in this light, almost metallic, as if from some
future-scape.  The lone surfer SHREDS a long, endless
right wall.
ACCELERATING INTO REAL TIME -- as he stares into the pit,
digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers
down.
His moves becoming aggressive, frenzied--


INT.  BLACK SEDAN

An M-16 clip is SMACKED into place and cocked with a
CACHACK!  Ammo clips are SNICK-SNICKED into handgun butts
and a long clip is SSSNICKED into an UZI.
Watches are checked.  The PIG NOSE people nod to each
other.


EXT.  BANK

Pig Nose #1, steals into position near the glass doors,
slams his back to the wall, weapon to cheek, breath fast.


EXT.  OCEAN

FAST NOW -- the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face
of the wave.  The surfer TRIMS down the line, pivoting the
board and going straight down, CARVING the bottom.  He
slashes viciously back toward the lip and--

In a radical INVERTED AIR ATTACK sails SIX feet above the
wave in an explosion of water--


INT.  BANK

--BAAAAAAMMM!
Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose #1 SPINS inside.  He
fires a burst into the ceiling.  BRRAAMM!!

                         PIG NOSE #1
          EVERYBODY on the floor!

PEOPLE drop.
VERY FAST HERE--
Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES and customers--
Another PIG NOSE watches the door--
Pig Nose #1 moves behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in
hand.


INT.  SURVEILLANCE VAN

Dark. Monitors SHOW SLOW SCANS of the bank INTERIOR.
Two MEN wear headphones and black windbreakers with FBI
stenciled on the back.  One watches with binoculars.

                         BINOCULARS
          Bingo.  We're on.  Let's go.
          Where's the big college
          quarterback?!  Are you with us,
          Utah?


EXT.  BANK WALL

A MAN in his twenties.  His head spins revealing rain-
slicked hair and face, eyes wide, bright.  An edgy
handsomeness to him.
He pops a stick of Wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun
on one leg and leans against the wall.  He wears a
headset... through which we hear the FBI guy yelling for
him.
This is JOHNNY UTAH.

                         BINOCULARS (FILTERED)
          Utah, where the hell are ya!?

Utah takes his headset off...


INT.  BANK

Pig Nose #1 LEAPS over the counter, holds a canvas sack
filled with booty from tellers' drawers.

                         PIG NOSE #1
          Fuckin' shake it!

Pig Nose #2 nods with his snubby nose, hurries toward the
exit.


EXT.  FIRST VIRGINIA BANK

The bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the
alley where they jump into the SEDAN.  THE DRIVER, the
WOMAN PIG NOSE, punches it and the TIRES WHIRRR on the
slick pavement.
The sedan launches down the alley.

Utah running.  Like a freight train.  Splashing through a
cross-alley.  He doesn't break stride as he slams his
shoulder into a large, steel GARBAGE DUMPSTER.
DRIVING it like a football training sled into the ALLEY
where--

THE SEDAN LOCKS 'EM UP seconds too late as it SKIDS and
SLAMS into it, CRUNCHING into the brick wall and--
Still alive -- GRINDS into reverse back down the alley,
HEADLIGHTS SMASHED, it guns it backward as--

UTAH leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car.
He has a brick in his right hand.  He cocks it back.
Johnny HEAVES the brick thirty yards and--

SMASH!  The brick EXPLODES into the windshield,
SPIDERWEBBING the glass.
Lady Pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into
her face.

                         LADY PIGNOSE
          Son of a bitch!

The car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked
car.  Lady Pignose slams the thing into DRIVE, cuts the
wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement.

UTAH hurtles from the alley.  He leaps, somehow TACKLES
the DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street.
He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips
the steering wheel hard right.

The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota.  Utah bounces
forward, slamming into the asphalt.  Glass shards and
crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam
whistles hot.

Pig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped.  Can't get his
crushed door open.  The DRIVER pushes open her door.
Gropes for her pistol.  Utah springs -- no respect for a
lady.  He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and
again until the gun drops.  Utah kicks it away as the
woman collapses in pain.

Pig Nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot.  Utah
leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the
shotgun.

                         UTAH
          Halt.  FBI!

Pig Nose #1 spins.  We sense reckless anger.  He raises
the UZI.  Utah squeezes the trigger.

No death.  No blood.
Just buzzers and flashing bulbs.
Pig Nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine.
Utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone".  Pig Nose rips
the tape off his face and the FBI CADET shakes his head in
disgust.

OBSERVERS step forward.  Bank customers.  Bank tellers.
All FBI personnel.  MEDICAL STAFF offer the woman driver
assistance.  Pig Nose #1 heads for Johnny, but is subdued
by other agents.

                         PIG NOSE #1 (FBI CADET)
          I wanna say just two words to you,
          asshole, SIMU-LATION!!!  Johnny-
          fuckin' Utah.  Guys like you will do
          anything to win!

Utah stares back in defiance.
The SURVEILLANCE van pulls up nearby.
BINOCULARS runs out and pinches two fingers together,
right in Johnny's face.

                         BINOCULARS
          This far, Utah!  You're this far
          from being the most overqualified
          guy Burger King ever had.  Get me?!

                         UTAH
          Yes sir.  Sir?

                         BINOCULARS
          What?

Johnny gestures to the car.

                         UTAH
          I did stop the perpetrators.

Utah turns to go.  As he passes he casually raises his
laser-shotgun and re-triggers Pig Nose's flak vest.
LIGHTS AND BUZZERS.
Pig Nose explodes.  More agents restrain him.
Screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys.
Utah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign
which bears the FBI SEAL and reads "Combat Village,
Quantico, Virginia."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

Red sky.  A luminous Pacific.  Five foot faces.  Nice
curl.  A lineup of SURFERS wait outside the break.
Silhouetted, bobbing like a pack of sea mammals.


INT./ EXT.  TAXI

A flood of orange through the windshield as the cab crawls
down Ocean Park to the sea.  CAMERA HANDHELD from the back
seat.
The driver turns to us.

                         DRIVER
          Anywhere?  You don't care?

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          Anywhere.  I've just never seen the
          ocean before.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  VENICE BEACH

JOHNNY UTAH trudging across the sand, holding his shoes.
Garment bag and a big duffel over his shoulder.
He looks silly in his dark suit, tie loosened, wearing a
turned around baseball cap.
He wiggles his toes in the sand, looks around like a kid.
A pack of BOUNCING BEAUTIES jog through frame.
Utah grins, reaches up and turns his cap around.
It reads "I Love L.A."

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING

Looking down the face of the concrete monolith at Wilshire
and Veteran.  Ant-like, Johnny Utah's tiny figure moves
toward the entrance.

                         VOICE (OVER)
          Day One in LA, special agent Utah.
          You may have been top two percent of
          your class at Quantico but you have
          exactly zero hours in the field
          here.  You know nothing...


INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI BULLPEN

Supervising Agent BEN HARP leads Utah across the bullpen.
Rows of desks.  Agents sitting at computer terminals.
Data hell.  Looks like he got a job at Xerox.

                         HARP
          You know less than nothing.  If you
          even knew that you knew nothing, at
          least that would be something, but
          you don't.

                         UTAH
          Yes, sir.

Utah is wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase.  Harp is
mid-thirties, confident of stride, tanned of skin, perfect
of hair.  GQ.  Aggressive.

                         HARP
          Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?

                         UTAH
          Sir?

                         HARP
          All the food groups?  Avoiding
          sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that
          my people maintain cardiovascular
          fitness.  We stay off hard liquor,
          cigarettes...

                         UTAH
                  (poker face)
          I take the skin off chicken.

Harp glances at him, eyes narrowing.  They reach a
glassed-in compound of small offices.  Harp swings the
door open and the other agents look up as Utah enters.

                         HARP
          This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And
          you're in the bank-robbery capital
          of the world--

                         UTAH
          1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26
          percent from the year before.

                         HARP
          That's right.  And we nailed over a
          thousand of them.  We did it by
          crunching data.  Good crime-scene
          work, good lab work, good data-base
          analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a
          car once.  You getting the signal,
          special agent?

                         UTAH
          Zero distortion, sir.

He picks up a donut from someone's desk, a succulent
glazed jelly.

                         UTAH
          I love these things.

He looks right at Harp.  Takes a big fuck-you bite.

                         HARP
          You're a real blue-flame special,
          aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why
          they sent you to LA.  Must be an
          asshole shortage.

                         UTAH
          Not so far.

                                            CUT TO:

UNDERWATER

A blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines.
VOOM!  A figure rockets down INTO FRAME in a curtain of
bubbles.  A gawky AGENT, in less than stylish FBI trunks,
flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom
of a pool.


INT.  GYMNASIUM POOL - DAY

The pool casts wavy distortions upon TWO DOZEN MEN, all
grumbling as they stand in line, wearing T-shirts with FBI
logos, sweats and sneakers.  We hear a splash, and the men
shuffle forward.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          The dolls love this baby.  It brings
          them luck when they rub it -- right
          between their buttons.

CLOSE ON tape measure wrapped around a generous belly.
PULL BACK to reveal VETERAN AGENT COREY measuring the
ample waist of ANGELO PAPPAS.  This 54 year old silver
haired Greek stands rubbing his belly like a Zulu chief.

                         COREY
          Angelo, we need a bigger tape.

                         PAPPAS
          Just read the goddamn number.

                         COREY
          Still a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it
          down, wear a girdle--

                         PAPPAS
          Screw you and this holistic fitness
          crap!  At least my arms don't flap
          in the wind.

Corey secretly squeezes his bicep as...
A whistle blows.  A broad shouldered MAN wearing an FBI
cap barks at the Greek.

                         BIG SHOULDERS
          Okay, Pappas, let's put on the
          blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve
          at least two bricks from the bottom.

JOHNNY UTAH enters the pool area in the distance.  Says
something to one of the agents.  Is pointed toward us as--
Corey ties the blindfold and guides Pappas to the edge of
the pool.

                         PAPPAS
          I've been in the field 33 years,
          fired my piece 23 times in the line
          of duty, and I got no idea what a
          blind man fetching bricks has gotta
          do with being a Special Agent!

Johnny has walked up.  Pappas, blindfolded, turns directly
to Utah as he continues, thinking it's Corey.

                         PAPPAS
          Added to which indignity, I got
          three months left to retirement and
          they saddle me with some blue-flamer
          fresh out of Quantico for a partner.
          Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas
          or something.

                         UTAH
          The shit they pull, huh?

Pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool.
Huge backblast of water.  The other agents hoot and
holler.
Corey swears and wipes off his clipboard.
Johnny steps to the edge, looks down.
We see the blindfolded Pappas groveling along the bottom.
The other agents cheer as Pappas heads for the surface.

                         COREY
          Here he comes.  Hold up a fish,
          he'll take it right outta your hand.

Pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters
for breath.  He grabs the edge and angrily slaps two
bricks on the tiles.  He rips off the blindfold looks up
and frowns.

A HAND ENTERS FRAME to help him up.  Pappas takes it and
Johnny hauls him on deck.

                         COREY
          Hey Shamu, this is your guy.

Pappas eyes the new agent warily.  Extends his hand.

                         PAPPAS
          Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.

                         UTAH
          Punk.  Quarterback Punk.

                         PAPPAS
                  (grinning)
          Welcome to Sea World, kid.


INT.  SEDAN - DAY

SERIES OF TIGHT SHOTS
ECU sweep hand of a dive watch clicks through the
seconds.
Magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun.
Velcro straps of Second Chance body armor are fastened.
White gloves are pulled snug over strong hands.
A silk tie is straightened.  A shotgun slide is cocked.
The sweep hand approaches the twelve.
A LATEX MASK is pulled over the back of a man's head.

                         VOICE
          The little hand says...

The mask turns into FULL CLOSE-UP.  It is RONALD REAGAN.

                         REAGAN
          ... let's rock and roll.


INT.  BANK OF AMERICA

Business as usual.  The scene so normal you know something
is about to happen.  An exiting MAN stuffs bucks into his
wallet, reaching for the door which--
SLAMS INWARD.  He is hit by a wall of EX-PRESIDENTS.

REAGAN charges in with his buddies RICHARD M. NIXON,
LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON and JOHN F. KENNEDY.
Reagan throws the poor guy skidding across the floor.
Nixon buttstrokes a guard, hard in the nuts, with his 12
gauge.
The other guard goes for his holster -- finds himself
facing three shotguns and one very large handgun.
Reagan sights down the pistol.

                         REAGAN
          Use a gun, go to heaven.

The guard freezes.  White and sweaty.
Tricky Dick slips up to him and collects the pistol.
Kennedy covers the stunned customers.
Johnson backs up against the door jam, watching the
street, and the sedan idling at the curb.

                         REAGAN
          EVERYBODY FREEZE!!  That's right.
          ALL TELLERS step back from the
          counter!  Hands on heads!  MOVE!!

Nixon and Reagan move quickly to the counter as the
tellers comply.

                         REAGAN
          Everybody else on the floor!  Do it!
          On the floor, let's go.

                         NIXON
          SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!!  You got
          earwax?!

Nixon grabs a stunned woman by the arm and hurls her to
the floor.
She lands hard.  Everyone is on the deck by now.
The Presidents move fast.
Reagan leaps onto the counter.  Stands up where he can see
all.
Nixon hurdles to tellers' side and they start moving down
the line together.  Reagan controlling the room as Nixon
quickly empties the tellers' cash drawers into the sack.
His hands move like lightning.

                         REAGAN
          Just stay cool.  Everybody stay
          cool.  Heads down.  Eyes down.  The
          money's insured--

TIGHT ON -- MONEY flying into the sack.

                         REAGAN
          -- it's not worth dying for.
          Another 45 seconds of your time.
          That's all.  Then -- Whoa, Tricky
          Dick!

Nixon pulls a pack of twenties back out of the bag and
tosses it to the BANK MANAGER.  Who reflexively catches
it.
Then drops it like a hot-potato just before--
It EXPLODES into a cloud of blue ink.  The manager is dyed
blue.
Burnt money showers on the terrified customers.

LBJ looks at his watch and WHISTLES.
The bandits sprint for the front doors.
Kennedy exits first, followed by Reagan.
LBJ pauses under the surveillance camera, drops his
trousers and MOONS.  Thank you is written across his white
butt.

BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITOR--

High angle, distorted wide shot.  LBJ hoists his pants and
splits, followed out by Nixon, who exits backward with the
famous double peace-sign held high overhead.

IMAGE FREEZES.  Victorious Nixon, grainy... something from
a time warp.  The image SUDDENLY GOES INTO HIGH-SPEED
REVERSE.  The bank robbery sequence zips backward.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          Twenty-seven banks in three years.
          In and out in 90 seconds.  Nobody
          ever gets shot.  We're talking solid
          professionals.

WE ARE IN--


INT.  BANK CRIME SCENE - LATER

UTAH & PAPPAS are watching a monitor in the glassed-in
office.  The robbery REPLAYS on grainy BLACK & WHITE
videotape.
The bandits barge in, raise shotguns and order everybody
to the floor.

                         UTAH
          Good move.

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah, they control the room well.
          Stick strictly to the cash drawers.

VIDEO TAPE -- Utah is reverse-scanning.  The bandits walk
BACKWARD into the bank.  The explosion of blue ink is
sucked back into the pack of money, then leaps back into
President Nixon's hand.

                         UTAH
          They don't go for the vault?

                         PAPPAS
          Never go for the vault.  They never
          get greedy.

                         UTAH
          Smart.  You burn time in the vault.

                         PAPPAS
          Reagan usually drives.  Stolen
          switch car, they leave it running at
          the curb, looks parked from a
          distance.  When they run, they dump
          the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean
          vanish.

Utah stops the video, now FAST-FORWARDING it, stopping
where President Nixon separates the exploding "dye pack"
planted with the money, before he tosses it aside.

                         UTAH
          Surgical.  Look at them separate the
          dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know
          their jobs.

                         PAPPAS
          The Ex-Presidents are the best I've
          seen, kid.

Outside the windowed partition POLICE OFFICERS interview
frightened customers.
Hotshot agents MUNOZ and COLE enter from the main floor of
the bank.  Think they're very slick.

                         MUNOZ
          Anytime you two are finished jerking
          off watching MTV I need to get a
          look at that tape.

                         COLE
                  (sloppy grin)
          Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your
          theory on the Presidents?

                         PAPPAS
          Just take the tape, Cole.

Now Munoz starts to smile.

                         MUNOZ
          Hang ten, Pappas, like totally
          rad...
                  (to Utah)
          I gotta tell ya, the department
          loves it.

                         UTAH
          What's he talking about, Angelo?

Harp raps glass.  Cole and Munoz look sharp.
Harp enters addressing Pappas and Utah.

                         HARP
          They found the drop car up on
          Mulholland.  I want you two to go
          work it.

                         PAPPAS
          What?  Now I'm working the drop car?
          Who's handling the scene here?

                         HARP
          Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting
          them run with the ball for a while.

Cole and Munoz gloat.

                         PAPPAS
          Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case
          for two years.

                         HARP
                  (zeroing in on
                   Pappas)
          That's the point, isn't it?

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's
          dick the old guys, huh, Harp?

                         HARP
          Supervising Special Agent, Harp.
          Now I want you to go work the drop
          car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

The Greek rises like a proud bull.

                         PAPPAS
          Sure.  No problem.  How about your
          office?  Your office need vacuuming?
          We could do that too.

Pappas and Utah move toward the door.  It's a tight
squeeze as they pass Cole and Munoz.  Especially Pappas.

                         PAPPAS
          Excuse me.

Read as fuck you.


EXT.  MULHOLLAND SCENIC TURNOUT - NIGHT

The diamond field of LA glitters below.  The small parking
area off Mulholland is filled with squad cars.  Red and
blue disco.
A flock of UNIFORMS milling about a non-descript CHEVY.


INT.  SEDAN FRONT SEAT

FLASHLIGHT BEAM prowls the interior, stopping on a small
printed card, folded like a pup tent, left upon the bench
seat.  It reads "Sanitized For Your Protection."

                         PAPPAS
          Cute huh?  They love to fuck with
          us.

UTAH & PAPPAS pull their heads out of the sedan.  Forensic
expert, HALSEY, stands behind them.

                         PAPPAS
          Don't tell me, let me guess.  The
          switch-car was stolen this morning...
                  (Halsey is nodding
                   his head)
          They vacuumed and 409'd the
          interior, did the windows, emptied
          the ashtrays...

                         HALSEY
          Yeah, the usual drill.

Utah pulls on a rubber glove and lifts the card off the
seat.  Studies it.  Talks to Halsey like Halsey's the one
that just out of Quantico, not Utah.

                         UTAH
          Could've taken their gloves off
          before setting that card.  Laser it
          for prints.  Maybe held it to his
          teeth -- check the edges for saliva.
                  (a beat)
          Today was a scorcher.  This Chevy
          doesn't have air conditioning...

                         HALSEY
          Sweat secretions in the seatbacks?

                         PAPPAS
          You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me
          know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under
          the seat while you're at it.
                  (looks at his watch)
          Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's
          still young... you can solve this
          case and start on another one.

                         UTAH
          Well, what're your ideas on these
          guys?

                         PAPPAS
          Forget about it, kid.  They're
          ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie
          Mormon affirmative action assholes
          handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so
          I must be senile, right?  They
          better get me out before I start
          pissing myself in public.  Drooling.
          It would look bad for the Bureau,
          right?

                         UTAH
          So you're gonna coast to retirement,
          when you could nail these guys and
          go out with come dignity.

                         PAPPAS
          You watch your fucking mouth!
                  (pounds his chest)
          Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal
          of Honor right here!

The two men glare at each other.  Utah looks away.

                         UTAH
          Sorry.

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah.  That was thirty years ago
          anyway.
                  (stares out at the
                   bright horizon)
          L.A.'s changed a lot since then.
          The air got dirty and the sex got
          clean.
                  (after a beat)
          So you want to nail the Ex-
          Presidents?  Be a big hero?

                         UTAH
          Yeah.  What's your theory?

                         PAPPAS
          The fucking punks are surfers.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT

Dark, lit by the TV at the far end of the bullpen.  PAPPAS
and UTAH sit in front of the flickering Sony in the big
empty room.  Angelo punches a button on the VCR.

ON THE SCREEN--

LBJ turns his back to the fish-eye lens, drops trousers
and moons the camera.  Thank you.
Angelo FREEZES on LBJ'S butt.

                         PAPPAS
          I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our
          face.  Lookit the tan on this guy.

The young agent looks forward.
Stares at the white inscribed butt bracketed by deep
bronze tan lines.

                         UTAH
          Oh well he must be a surfer.

                         PAPPAS
          Shutup, you might learn somethin'
          you're not careful... So last year
          Nixon scuffs a counter going over.
          There was a soil sample.  Non-
          specific mud traces of asphalt,
          oils, blah, blah... sand and...
          carnuba wax.  So I became a wax
          expert.  There's 80 some uses for
          this stuff, something like five
          hundred products.

He tosses Utah a ream of computer printout.  Utah scans
lists of brand names.

                         UTAH
          Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax?
          Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his
          mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in
          it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe
          scuffs the counter.

                         PAPPAS
          The lab made three possible matches,
          this was one of 'em.

Pappas opens his desk drawer, takes something out and
throws it to Johnny.  A pastel blue hockey puck wrapped in
cellophane.
A block of "Mr. Zog's Sex Wax".

                         UTAH
                  (reading)
          Sex wax?  You're not into kinky
          shit, are you Angelo?

                         PAPPAS
          Surfers use it on their boards.
          They rub sand into it for traction.

                         UTAH
          Thanks for the tip.  I needed this
          knowledge.

Pappas shoves a thick file folder toward Utah.

                         PAPPAS
          Now lookit the dates on the
          robberies.  This is strictly a
          summer job for these guys.

Johnny leafs through it.

                         UTAH
          ... Four months.  June to October.
          Mmmm...same the year before.

                         PAPPAS
          Another month and we don't see 'em
          again 'til next summer.

Utah stares at Angelo as it dawns.  Grins suddenly.

                         UTAH
          They're traveling the rest of the
          year on the money, going where the
          waves are...

Pappas starts to smile.  Suddenly, he jumps up onto his
desk, gets down in a speed-crouch, arms extended.

                         PAPPAS
                  (to one and all)
          The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to
          finance their endless summer!

Johnny watches, grinning.  The night security GUARD walks
in.  Utah turns to the guard, shrugs.

                         UTAH
          I think he needs a vacation.

The guard nods understanding.

INT.  SURFSHOP - MALIBU PIER - DAY

Long stack-up rack of gleaming SURFBOARDS.
A HAND reaches in, pulling out a board from the middle of
the deck.

JOHNNY UTAH hefts it.  Sights along it.  Trying to look
familiar with alien equipment.  Behind him is a whip-thin
15 YEAR OLD SALESMAN.  Nut-brown with platinum hair,
jammed day-glo shorts, sleeveless T-shirt, unlaced Ug-
boots.

                         15
          Highest performance, very kind.  If
          you want to get aggro, man, this
          stick can handle your best rage.
          Where you surf?

                         UTAH
          I don't.

                         15
          Whoa!!  Back up!  This's a 5'6" tri-
          fin squash-tail thruster.  You'd eat
          major shit on this, dude.

ACROSS THE ROOM we see Pappas trying on purple wraparound
sunglasses.

The salespunk pulls down a wide board with a garish
firebird paint scheme.  Like a lowrider flame-job.  The
logo reads "Dance with the Universe."

                         15
          Here, you need a rhino chaser like
          this one to learn on.  Good board.
          I mean for a pig board.

Utah hefts the board.  Scowls.  Hates anything he's not
great at.

PAPPAS sets his purchases on a counter: the glasses, some
plutonium-pink shorts, T-shirts, sun-block.  The GIRL
behind the counter is sixteen, barely contained in a
macrame bikini-top and "Dolphin" shorts.  Angelo picks up
a package of Sex Wax from a rack.  Sniffs it.

                         PAPPAS
                  (reading the label)
          "Best for your stick", huh?  This
          might not be enough.  I better get
          two.

The girl stifles a grin.  Thinks he's cute.  At the other
end of the counter, 15 is ringing up Utah's board.

                         15
          Hey, man, guys your age learning to
          surf, it's cool, there's nothing
          wrong with it.

                         UTAH
          I'm twenty-five.

                         15
          See that's what I'm saying, it's
          never too late.

Utah picks up the board and moves to leave.

                         15
          Hope you stay with it.  Surfin's
          the source.  It'll change your life.
          Swear to God.

                         UTAH
          Why can't I just walk around with
          this thing under my arm and act
          stoned?  Ask a few questions.

Angelo stops at the railing, points toward the ocean.

                         PAPPAS
          Look.  Look at them out there.

LONG LENS on packs of surfers sitting outside.  Bobbing
slowly.  Hunched like sea birds.  Waiting for an unseen
sign.  Disappearing and reappearing beyond the break.

                         PAPPAS
          They're like some kind of tribe.
          Got their own language.  You can't
          just walk up to these guys.  You've
          got to get out there.  Learn some
          moves.  Get into their head.  Pick
          up the speech.

                         UTAH
          Angelo, this stuff is for little
          rubber people who don't shave yet.

                         PAPPAS
          It's all balance, right?  And
          coordination.  How hard can it be?

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  SURFRIDER BEACH - DAY

WHAAAAAM!  Johnny is CLOBBERED by a wave.
He's flipped off his board and hits the water face-first
as the wave crashes over him.  Other surfers steer clear.

PAPPAS lounges in a beach chair in his plutonium pink
shorts, purple Vuarnet's and a T-shirt emblazoned with
"Surf This" across the chest.  A picnic basket sits close
at hand.  He winces at Utah's wipeout.  Shouts from his
beach chair.

                         PAPPAS
          I think you gotta hit them straight
          on!

                         UTAH
                  (out of breath)
          Got it...

UTAH holds the tip steady, gouges the face of a wave and
squirts out the other side.  Another wave rises and Utah
glides up over the hump.  He clears the swell and the
ocean suddenly smooths out like a giant lake.  Triumphant
over having made the lineup, he sits up on the board, and
falls over.

PAPPAS slices a green apple, some feta cheese and eats off
the knife.

UTAH climbs back on his board.  WHISTLES and HOOTS sound
as SURFERS spot a new swell.  Utah watches as the regulars
start catching rides.  Suddenly he feels like a lost dog
on a busy freeway.
A young LOCAL in a neon wetsuit slashes past him, inches
away.

                         LOCAL
          Outta the way, you dick!

Another, shredding viciously, is blasting toward him.

                         LOCAL 2
          Move it, kook!

Johnny paddles rapidly, ducks under.
Sees another, bigger wave coming.
Pissed off... at himself, at the downy-cheeked hotshots,
at the frustration, he turns his board around and starts
paddling hard.
He somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the
top of the board, then struggles up.  He's standing --
sort of.
Arms pinwheeling, he topples in a nasty crash...
Right in front of a SHAVED-HEAD SURFER on full
afterburner.

Johnny vanishes in an explosion of spray.  His board
SHOOTS OUT.
It SMASHES SIDEWAYS INTO RAZORHEAD.
The guy does an ugly endo.
Utah comes up GASPING for air, arms flailing.
His board, floating a few feet away, tugging at his ankle.
He drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath.
Razorhead, already back on his board, paddles over.
Points to a small dent in the fiberglass.

                         RAZORHEAD
          You dinged my board, kook!!

Utah looks up in apology as--
A CRUSHING RIGHT HOOK SMACKS HIS FACE!
Knocks him under.
Razorhead pulls a KNIFE from a sheath held by a thong
around his neck.  As Johnny surfaces, Razorhead slashes in
a vicious arc--
Severing Utah's leash, close to the board.
His flame-job surfboard bobs away.

                         RAZORHEAD
          Politeness counts, ASSHOLE!

The surf punk plunges under a wave, disappearing.

                         UTAH
          Goddamn son-of-a--

Before Utah can finish, another wave engulfs him and he
tumbles to shore, Razorhead nowhere to be seen.

ON PAPPAS as Johnny's flame-job board washes in at his
feet.  He calmly picks it up as Utah staggers INTO FRAME
out of the knee-deep whitewash.  Johnny rubs his jaw.
Spits blood.

                         PAPPAS
          Kid, maybe this ain't your sport.

Utah grabs the board out of Pappas' hands and stalks off
across the beach.


INT.  UTAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Johnny dead asleep.  Silence.  Then BRRRRR!!
He jacknifes up like he just took 20,000 volts.  His eyes
read panic.  He rolls up, legs scissor against tangled
sheets and he collapses over empty boxes.  He stumbles
like a blind man through the mess until he finds--
A tiny Indianapolis Colts FOOTBALL HELMET with a digital
clock for eyes.  5:00 a.m.  Johnny emits a drawn out
groan.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAWN

Deafening BOOM as a monster wave CRASHES below a sky the
color of slate.  A distant Pacific storm has brought the
swell.  10 foot faces.  Glassy, green walls the size of
houses beckoning from beyond the soup.

A lone FIGURE bobbing out beyond the break.
The surfer disappears behind the swell.
Then REAPPEARS, grinning across the smooth offshore
barrel.

UTAH wearing a wetsuit stands beside his surfboard,
craning forward to get a better look.
The surfer is a WOMAN.
She moves with liquid grace, in perfect harmony with the
sea, long hair flying out behind her.  She undulates like
a dancer.
Dipping, carving, slicing, making it look sooooo easy.
Johnny shakes his head.  Oh man, if she can do it...

                         UTAH
          Fuck it.

He stands, grabs his board and heads out into the icy
foam.

OCEAN BREAK
A horizon of whitecaps churn behind him.
He lies on his board, rising and dropping with the swell.
So far so good.  He spots a wave.  A fluid gray-green
house rising, forever rising.  Utah turns.  Paddles.  The
house catching him, lifting him high upon its roof.

Utah is committed.  He gets to his feet as his board
slices along the lip.  He peers over the falls, down the
face -- holy shit!  -- it looks like Niagara.  He loses
balance and spirals airborne, falling bullseye into the
IMPACT ZONE.  The entire force of the wave crashing upon
him, plunging him down into the--

WASHING MACHINE (UNDERWATER)

where he SPINS like a whirling dervish, LASHED to a
slamdancing surfboard at the mercy of God.
He is held prisoner in a grey-green churning nightmare,
like a six-ton pit bull has him by the neck, shaking him.
He looks around.  Can't tell up from down.
WHAM!  His head slams into the bottom -- rocks and sand.
Stunned, he struggles toward the light, finally bursting
to the--

SURFACE.  Gasping for breath.
The good news is he's breathing, the bad news is he's
surfaced in the impact zone.  Another wave crashes down,
stuffing him back into the washing machine.  Leaving no
sign of life in the white froth.  The orangeade surfboard
launches high into the sky, spinning like a misfiring
Trident missile, trailing its broken leash like a kite
tail.

IN THE WASHING MACHINE, Utah tumbles in a cold green hell.
His chest is convulsing, needing air now.
Suddenly a FIGURE lunges down INTO FRAME.
A hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him
toward--

THE SURFACE.  The WOMAN SURFER bursts through the foam.
Grabs her board for leverage.  Hauls Utah's head above the
water with one strong arm.
He is choking, coughing, slapping fatigued arms against
the surf, panic registering in his movements.

                         WOMAN SURFER
                  (yelling above the
                   roar)
          Swim, goddammit!  Come on!  Move
          it!

The woman gets her board under one of his arms for support
and sidekicks fiercely into the wave, holding him in a
painful grip.
With powerful strokes, she helps Utah make it to calmer
water outside the break.  The big waves, just forming up,
lift them and drop them as they pass.  Muted thunder when
the waves hit the beach.  She drags him half onto her
surfboard.
Practically slamming his face into the board.
He's coughing out saltwater.

ON THE WOMAN, our first good look at her.
She is EXQUISITE.  Hair slicked tight to her high-
cheekboned face, she looks sleek and feral, with eyes that
burn bright.
Especially when she's pissed.

                         WOMAN
          Look crazy son of a bitch!  You
          wanna commit suicide, you do it
          someplace else!

She undoes her leash and swims rapidly off, returning in a
few seconds with Johnny's board.  He takes it from her and
flops over it, still coughing.
Wipes at the salt-snot running out of his nose.
There is a cut over his eye from when he re-arranged the
rocks on the bottom.

                         WOMAN
          Look at this pig-board piece-a-shit.
          It's still got the price tag on it,
          for Chrissakes.  What'd you do, buy
          it yesterday?  You've got no
          business out here whatsoever.

Still gagging and gasping, Johnny manages a goofy grin.

                         UTAH
          Well, I saw you and--

                         WOMAN
          Yeah, you saw me and you figured
          that if a mere girl can do it, a big
          strong stud like you shouldn't have
          any problem.  Right?!  Well you
          figured wrong, dork!

She yanks her board around and strokes powerfully away
from him.

                         UTAH
          Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?

                         WOMAN
                  (without turning)
          Carefully, tough guy.  Very
          carefully.

                         UTAH
                  (yelling now)
          My name's Johnny Utah!

                         WOMAN
          Who cares!

                         UTAH
          I'm telling you so when you look
          back on this moment, you can
          think... there was this guy named
          Utah and he was pretty much a dork
          but maybe not such a bad person and
          I let him drown in conditions he had
          no business being in whatsoever...
          when I could have easily helped him.

Johnny calmly starts paddling toward shore.
Thundering white water pounding the rocks ahead of him.
He's stoic in the face of certain death.

                         UTAH
                  (over his shoulder,
                   gamely)
          Bye.

                         WOMAN
          Wait!  Jesus Christ!
                  (swimming back to
                   him)
          You're fucking crazy, you know that?
          You go in there you're gonna eat it
          on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

The woman paddles parallel to the shore and Utah pumps
along behind her.  She gets him away from the rocks, then
starts watching the incoming swell, timing it to the lull
between sets...

                         WOMAN
          Go when I say.  But stay down.  Just
          lie on the board.  Alright, let's
          go!

Utah paddles rapidly, following her, watching what she
does.
He is borne up by a low glassy wall.
He bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak.
Tumbles.  Stands unsteadily, grabbing his board.  Runs
clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes,
sucking water out.
On terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick-out
gracefully and disappear beyond the wave.

He flops on the sand.  Shivering.  Miserable.


EXT.  COAST HIGHWAY - LATER

LONG LENS... the woman is peeling off her wetsuit next to
a BATHTUB PORSCHE that needs a paint job.  Her board is
propped in the passenger seat.  Stereo is pumping.

UTAH WATCHES THROUGH BINOCULARS from 50 yards up the road.

THE WOMAN, in a bikini, towels off briskly.
Swimmer's shoulders.  Long muscular legs.  Lean and mean.
She jumps into the car without bothering to open the door.
Looks at her watch -- her manner is late, in a hurry.
Through the tiny windshield we watch her shimmy and shake
as she pulls her bottoms off and struggles into something
else, not too concerned about the morning traffic right
next to her.
She pulls on a T-shirt and them performs a Houdini act to
extract the bikini top out of one sleeve hole.

UTAH WATCHES IMPASSIVELY.  He starts his car and pulls out
onto PCH to follow as the bathtub Porsche zooms past.


EXT.  NEPTUNE'S NET

Utah cruises up slowly, pulls off the road.
Up ahead the Porsche turns into the parking lot of
NEPTUNE'S NET, a Coast Highway hangout that serves high-
grade steamed sea-critters and beer to low-grade road
trash, bikers and surfers.

Lean-and-Mean, wearing jeans and T-shirt, jumps out of the
Porsche.  She hurries to the door of the Net, unlocking it
for a couple of Mexican cooks -- helpers wearing
expressions like they wait like this for her every day.

UTAH puts down his binoculars and jots the Porsche's
license number down on a Tastee-Freeze bag.  867CDH.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

Green glow washes the intent faces of Utah and Pappas as
MISS DEER data specialist, enters 867 CDH into her
computer.
She is purebred American Indian, strong featured and
beautiful.
The screen freezes and the hard disk churns.
The DMV rap sheet scrolls down the screen.

                         PAPPAS
          This is your surfer contact?
          Female.  Blond hair.  Green eyes.
          5'6".  119 lbs?

                         MISS DEER
          Hmm, not bad, Utah.

                         UTAH
          Tyler Ann Endicott.  Born 11-27-64.

The rap sheet scrolls and scrolls and scrolls.  There is
something frightening about the length of this file.

                         UTAH
                  (reading from the
                   screen)
          ... Exhibition of speed.  Indecent
          exposure inside moving vehicle...

                         MISS DEER

                         UTAH
          Felony arrest!  "See adjoining
          file"...
                  (he types quickly)
          Kidnapping?!

Pappas crowds over Johnny's shoulder, reading.

                         PAPPAS
          This is great.  She ties some guy
          up.  Nude.  Leaves the scene and
          fails to return for 24 hours.  No
          convection.

                         MISS DEER
          Gotta avoid the rope tricks, Johnny.

Utah gives her a "very funny" look.  More data scrolls
forth.

                         UTAH
          What else they got on her?  I still
          haven't found anything I can really
          use.  I gotta find an approach, a
          way in -- here we go...
                  (he reads)
          Both parents deceased.  Plane crash.
          San Diego, '84.  Mmmm.  Yeah,
          definitely.

EXT.  NEPTUNE'S NET - DAY

A fat biker pulls out on a loud Harley (like there's any
other kind).  The place is almost empty in the weekend
lull between lunch and dinner.
Utah's car pulls in off PCH.


INT.  NEPTUNE'S NET

Tyler Endicott is working the counter.  She jams an order
on the wheel and turns TO US.

                         TYLER
          Next!  Oh, no.

REVERSE ON Johnny standing there.  Her only customer.

                         TYLER
          What do you want?

                         UTAH
          Shrimp and fries.

                         TYLER
          I mean, what do you want?  What are
          you doing hanging around here.

                         UTAH
                  (very serious)
          I need you to teach me.

                         TYLER
          Gimme a break.
                  (to cook)
          One shrimp and fries to go!
                  (to Johnny)
          Anything to drink?

                         UTAH
          I'm serious.

                         TYLER
          I can see that.  But forget it.
          Stick to tennis, or whatever you're
          good at.  Miniature golf.  Here,
          your number's 37.

                         UTAH
          Well, I'm just gonna go back out
          there till I catch on to it or break
          my neck.

She's looking at him.  This guy's nuts.  She laughs.

                         TYLER
          What is it?  You all of a sudden got
          this bug you had to go surfing?
          This is a line, right?

                         UTAH
          No, no.  See, all my life I've done
          things for other people.  In high
          school I played football because my
          old man expected me to.  Then my
          parents always figured I'd go to law
          school, so I did.  Football
          scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta
          Kappa--

                         TYLER
          This gonna take long?

                         UTAH
          Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks,
          right?
                  (he leans forward, a
                   little awkward)
          But two years ago they got killed in
          a car wreck and I just suddenly
          realized all my goals had been their
          goals.  And I hadn't been living my
          own life.  So I wanted something for
          myself.  Something that maybe didn't
          make any sense.  You know what I
          mean?

Tyler's smile has faded during this.  He's managed to
touch her, break through the tough-waitress act.  Now
she's looking him right in the eye.

                         UTAH
          I came out here from Ohio a month
          ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I
          didn't think it would effect me so
          much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or
          something.  I want to do what you
          do.  It's the truth.

                         TYLER
          Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a
          minute late I'm gone.
                  (he's grinning)
          And Stud... I didn't take you to
          raise.  I can show you a few things
          but after that you're on your own.
          That'll be four fifty.

He plunks down a ten and backs out the door, grinning.

                         UTAH
          Keep the change, Teach.

                  (she turns to him)
          Do you agree to do exactly what I
          say when I say it?

                         UTAH

UTAH pops INTO FRAME, arms extended, one leg in front of
the other, torso bent at the waist: classic surfing
stance.
Suddenly, he drops OUT OF FRAME.

WE PULL BACK -- Revealing Utah on his board, on the sand.

                         TYLER
          Do it again.

Tyler is making him "pop" up to his feet.  Again and
again.  GAWKERS stop to watch.  Utah fights humiliation.
He pops again.  And again.  Quick cuts.
On the next pop we--

PULL BACK to reveal Utah on his board, in a wave.  He is
surfing.
For about three seconds.  He flies off the deck, ass over
teakettle.
On the SPLASH we start--

A SEQUENCE OF TIME CUTS

Tyler and Utah straddle their boards outside the break.
She nods as the set comes, mellow right tubes.  Utah digs
in, arms pumping.
He feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and
starts down the wall.
And endos.

CLOUDY PLATINUM DAWN...
Tyler shouting at Utah as he fights for balance.
He flies off again.

BLINDING BRIGHT SUNRISE.  TYLER NEXT TO UTAH in the
lineup, straddling boards.  She moves her hands like a
fighter pilot explaining a dogfight maneuver.  Utah
watches intently.

Utah, backlit in glorious slow motion, tries a little turn
and feels his feet slip out.  He slams down butt-first on
the board, flips over, feet sticking straight up out of a
blast of diamond spray.
Tyler cringes, giving a look like it's hopeless.

TYLER AND UTAH, at their cars, skinning out of their
wetsuits.  Utah looks exhausted, downcast.  She snaps her
wet towel at his ass, cheering him up.

MALIBU PIER.  RAIN.  Tyler jumps out of her Porsche and
sees Utah sitting in his car.  She goes to him, opens the
door and starts pulling him out.  Come on you pussy.

UTAH and TYLER wait their turn in the lineup.  Rain pelts
their faces.  The waves are depressing inside mushers
under a gray sky.
Utah starts to paddle.  Tyler shakes her head no.  Utah is
committed to the I'face.  Tyler stifles a laugh.

                         TYLER
                  (to the other
                   surfers)
          I'm not with him.

Johnny gouges the lip, pops and begins the drop.
Suddenly, miraculously, he catches an edge and, still
standing, is carried along the tiny wall.

The wall begins to sag.  Utah shoots along the mush
hooting and continues hooting madly as he thrashes all the
way to shore.
He turns and grins foolishly out to sea.
Tyler bursts out laughing.


EXT.  MALIBU PIER - DUSK

Big surf.  Rough conditions.  Closeout set.
UTAH, board in arm, follows Tyler out of the whitewater
onto the beach.

                         TYLER
          It's closing out completely.  Let's
          call it.

Utah nods.  His eyes track the unruly break.

                         UTAH
          Who's that?

A LONE SURFER slashing through the pilings of the pier.  A
real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind
him.
SILHOUETTED against a crimson sky and backlit spray the
figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion
that is somehow balletic.
Laying out bottom turns, torquing his body and blasting
the lip a few times, moving so fast his long dark hair
stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car
window on the freeway.

                         TYLER (V.O.)
          That's Bodhi.  They call his the
          Bodhisattva.

Utah watches as THE BODHISATTVA gets vertical with a snap,
trims down the volcanic wall, carves the bottom, pivots,
pumps to the top, gouging the lip, getting six feet of
air.
Gawkers HOWL and shout praise at the manic surfer.

                         TYLER
          The modern savage.  Guy's even
          crazier than you, Johnny Utah.
          C'mon.

They start to walk.  The sky darkens as the sea finally
closes out completely.  The Bodhisattva seems to levitate
through the shapeless mush to shore.

                         ROACH (O.S.)
          Brah!

Suddenly a football whistles through the air above Utah's
head.
He watches as--
The Bodhisattva, board under arm, walking out of the
whitewater, makes a one-handed chest catch.

A few yards away two teams of SURFERS play football.
Utah gazes down the beach at the Bodhisattva.
Almost 30 years old, his body lean and hard as a tree
trunk.  Hardness in the face accented by long Comanche
hair.

                         BODHI
          Hey Tyler!

She whirls.  Bodhi pumps his arm.  Tyler jogs back for the
catch.  Bullseye.  She shoots Bodhi a look.  Something
crosses her face.
Bodhi smiles.  Tyler doesn't.  Then it passes.
She chucks the ball to Utah.
Who drops his board and makes the catch in one move.
He SPINS the football on his fingertip, drops it on his
foot, kicks it up into his hands.  Razzle dazzle.  He
grins evilly.


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Rimmed by a dozen car HEADLIGHTS at the edge of the sand.
Utah crouches, waiting for the snap from NATHANIEL,
ponytailed and powerfully built.  Facing them on defense
are Bodhi, Tyler and three others: ROACH, gonzo and
spiked-haired.  GROMMET... 17 and thin as a stick, and
ROSIE, a biker with piggy eyes and arms blue with tattoos.

MONTAGE STYLE -- Utah tosses a flurry of mindboggling
passes.  Every one picture perfect.  Nathaniel scrambles
z-out left, turns and the ball is practically waiting for
him.  Touchdowns galore.  Endzone dancing.  Bodhi stares
at him curiously.

Tyler rushes.  Utah enjoys scrambling, ducking left and
right, twisting her into a pretzel.  Play after play.
Utah tosses another touchdown, but Tyler keeps coming.
Sacking him.
They lie together in a heap, laughing.

Bodhi quarterbacks.  Utah rushes.  Bodhi fakes a pass then
runs, ball tucked in his arm.  Utah tears after him.  Flat
out speed run.
Roach attempts a block.  Utah hits him like a freight
train.
Roach hits the sand face first.
Grommet and Rosie the biker in a squeeze play.
Utah, fierce now, blasts between them.  No mercy.
Utah can't play for fun.  We see his expression.
Something scary there.  What we will call "juggernaut
mode".
Tyler just steps aside.

Bodhi running along wet sand as a wave sweeps up the
beach.  Looks back.  Sees a demon shooting up roostertails
of spray behind him, gaining.  Pours it on.  Both of them
pistoning through curtains of water.  Not a game anymore.
Closing on the endzone.  5 yards.  Utah is airborne.
SLAMS BODHI LIKE A SAM MISSILE.  They crash and burn
together in the surf.

The other surfers run up.  Who's this newcomer that just
centerpunched their main man?  Industrial strength
tension.

                         ROACH
          The fuck you doin' man?!  You
          fuckin' crazy?

Bodhi flashes a million dollar smile.

                         BODHI
          Chill, brah.  You know who this is?
          Johnny Utah.  Ohio State, all-
          conference.
                  (to Utah)
          Rose Bowl three years ago.  Right?

Johnny nods.  Tyler looks at him -- no shit?

                         ROACH
          Johnny fuckin' Utah!  Fuckin'-A!
          Yeah, I remember that game, man.
          You were on-fire.  They could not
          stop your ass.

                         GROMMET
          Radical!  Head-butt, dude!!

Johnny gestures "Please no".
Enthused by the concept, Grommet turns to Nathaniel.

                         GROMMET
          Head-butt!!!

They do.  Their foreheads CRACK together.  They stumble
backwards in giddy euphoria.  Nathaniel laughs like Pee
Wee Herman.

                         BODHI
          Something happened.  You got nuked
          in the last quarter.

                         UTAH
          Yeah, my knee got folded about 90
          degrees the wrong way.

                         BODHI
          And that's why you never went pro?

                         UTAH
          Two years of surgery.  I missed my
          window.  Limped through law school
          instead.

                         BODHI
          Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?
                  (like it's a disease)
          Too bad.  But at least you're
          surfing now.  So your life's not
          over yet, right?

                         UTAH
          Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - 16TH FLOOR - DAY

Utah, in shorts and T-shirt, carries his flame-job
surfboard past surveillance cameras and portraits of Bush,
Hoover and Webster.  Special Agent Cole walks by.  Eyes
the board.  Speaks deadpan.

                         COLE
          Like totally rad stick, dude.


INT.  BULLPEN

Utah tries to act casual as he carries the board to his
desk on the other side of the room.  He has to walk past
the entire gauntlet to get there.

                         SEVERAL AGENTS
          Gnarly, man... hang ten...
          cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it
          up!

Harp comes straight for him like a homing missile.

                         HARP
          How was the beach?

                         UTAH
          Fine.

                         HARP
          Surf conditions okay?

                         UTAH
          A little mushy.

                         HARP
          A little mushy!  You think the
          taxpayers would like it, Utah, if
          they knew they were paying a federal
          agent to surf and pick up girls?

                         UTAH
          Babes.

                         HARP
          What?

                         UTAH
          The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh,
          this type of undercover operation is
          entirely dependent on picking up the
          idiom of the speech.  Otherwise
          penetration is not possible, sir.
          Of the social infrastructure, I
          mean.

Harp inhales through his nose.  A bad sign.

                         HARP
          Where is Pappas?

Utah points across the room.  Harp turns.
PAPPAS, sitting behind his desk in his "Surf This" T-shirt
and pink shorts, lifts the purple Vuarnets like Tom Cruise
in Risky Business.
Looks directly at Harp.  Smiles innocently.


INT.  HARP'S OFFICE

Harp paces.  Type-A suppressed rage.
Utah and Pappas endure Harp's wrath.

                         HARP
          Special Agent Utah, this is not some
          job flippin' burgers at the drive-in.
          Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes,
          your approach to this case bothers
          me.  And yes, you bother me.  You
          two have produced squat in the last
          two weeks, during which time the Ex-
          Presidents have robbed two more
          banks!!  Do you have anything even
          remotely interesting to tell me?

                         UTAH
          Caught my first tube this morning.

Pappas signals, unseen by Harp, for Utah to shut the fuck
up.


INT.  CORRIDOR TO COMPUTER ROOM

Johnny and Angelo walking.

                         PAPPAS
          What, you couldn't have just left
          the thing in your car?

                         UTAH
          It sticks out, so I can't lock it.
          Look, Angelo, you think I joined the
          FBI to learn to surf?  This was your
          lame-o idea in the first place.  You
          gotta back me up on this.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny, all I can say is we better
          come up with something real soon.

Johnny cocks an eyebrow and opens the door to the computer
room ceremonially, like a doorman at the Ritz-Carlton.
Miss Deer looks up as they enter.


INT.  COMPUTER ROOM

TIGHT ON CRT as a lab report scrolls up the screen.  Gas
chromatography and spectroanalysis.  Columns of elements
and compounds, listed as percentage-of-sample.

                         MISS DEER (V.O.)
          Encino Savings & Loan guard grabbed
          LBJ's ponytail.  We recovered one
          hair.

WIDER, showing Utah and Pappas over her shoulder at the
terminal.

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year.
          Guy got his jaw broken for it.

                         MISS DEER
          One four centimeter strand.  Color
          brown.  Oily.  Slight wave.

                         PAPPAS
          Hell, what're we waiting for, let's
          go pick the guy up.

                         UTAH
          Angelo, pay attention.  There's
          gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is
          showing traces of toxins.  PCBs.
          Heavy elements... selenium, titanium
          and arsenic.

                         PAPPAS
          Guy's the Toxic Avenger.

Utah is excited as he fits the pieces together for his
partner.

                         UTAH
          The beaches are always being closed
          because of waste spills, right?  And
          surfers are territorial.  They stick
          mostly to certain breaks.  If we can
          get some hair samples, and get a
          match to a certain beach, we'd know
          which break the Ex-Presidents surf.
          You buyin' this?

                         PAPPAS
          No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's
          gonna bug the shit out of Harp.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LATIGO - DAY

Department of Health sign reads, "Beach Temporarily
Closed." Beyond it crashes a wasted northwest swell.

Two frustrated teenage SURFERS huddle underneath a towel.
Marijuana smoke seeps upward.
A sandaled FOOT enters frame and taps their leg.  Angry
heads poke up from beneath the towel, nostrils and mouths
billowing smoke.
The two wear T-shirts which read "Passion for Slashin" and
"Psycho Stick".
PAPPAS smiles, standing there in his beach wear, trying to
blend in.  He doesn't.

                         PAPPAS
          When you two are done makin' out, I
          need to talk to you.

                         PAPPAS
          I just want to know if you surf here
          a lot.

          Shit yeah, like totally everyday
          when it's jammin'.  What is this,
          fucking narco entrapment or what,
          dude?

Pappas flashes his FBI star.  He whips out a pair of
scissors.
Brandishes them like some over-the-hill "Jason".

                         PAPPAS
          Not exactly, dudes.


EXT.  COUNTY LINE - DAY

Row of SURFMOBILES parked along a cliff, facing the ocean,
doors open, stereos blasting, SURFERS hanging, sitting on
hoods.
Utah moves along the cars, looking surfed-out.
He's tanned, relaxed.  Hair starting to bleach out.  One
of the tribe.

                         UTAH
          Whoa, brah, easy now... Don't move!
                  (Utah bends close,
                   reaching for Surf-
                   Rat's ear)
          Got some huge sucker crawling into
          your--
                  (he plucks at a tuft
                   of hair)
          Got it!  Uuuughhh.

                         SURF-RAT
          Leave some fuckin' hair, man!

Utah squashes, then inspects the mysterious creepy-crawler
hidden in his palm.  He wipes his hand on his towel, which
he keeps balled up in his other hand.

                         SURF-RAT
          What was it?

                         UTAH
          Saved your butt, bro.  Close one.

Utah shivers in disgust, then coyly turns and walks away.
The surf-rat desperately pats his ear for traces.

INT.  FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT

A long series of ENVELOPES are displayed on a desk.  Each

HALSEY inspects each envelope.

          Naw, this isn't it.

UTAH holds up an envelope with a skinny woven ponytail
sticking out.
PAPPAS shrugs.

                         PAPPAS
          He moved.

Halsey picks up an envelope marked "Latigo Beach".

Pappas grabs the envelope, studies it, crooks his head.

EXT.  LATIGO BEACH - DAY

EXTREME LONG LENS scans the beach from a height.  A gray,
miserable day.  Beach crowd thin except for diehards.

The image drifts across faces, BODIES.  Surfers walking
with boards.
Talking, sitting with pubescent girls.
The image settles on Johnny, astride his board, bobbing
beyond the break.

ON PAPPAS, scanning with powerful binoculars from his car.

CLOSE ON UTAH, out among the flock of hardcore surfers.
Ostensibly waiting for a wave, his eyes search the others
around him, clicking methodically from face to face.
Finally he swings his board around and awkwardly catches a
ride.
The modest wave carries him toward the beach as he
balances, tense and style-less.

He passes someone we've seen before.  The RAZORHEAD from
the first day.  In concentration, Johnny doesn't see the
guy.
But Razorhead definitely sees him.

JOHNNY reaches the beach and jogs up the sand.  He picks
up a towel and talks into it as he dries his hair.  A
glimpse of the walkie-talkie hidden beneath.

                         UTAH
          Big zippo so far.  How about you?

                         PAPPAS (RADIO)
          Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll
          be subtle, if it's here at all.

PAPPAS WATCHES as Johnny crosses toward the outside shower
next to the public restroom.
LONG LENS view of Utah passing OUT OF SIGHT behind the
building.

AT THE SHOWER Johnny sets down his gear and opens his
wetsuit to the warm, salt-free jet of water.  TRACKING
SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over his face.
A HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly.

TIGHT ON UTAH, his eyes opening.

REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE OTHERS.
They are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS.
Scalps shaved on the sides.  Hair military short on top,
lengthening into pigtails in the back.  Tattoos.  Wrist
chains.
TONE, ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD.  The one who socked Utah
before is BUNKER.  They spread out flanking him.

                         WARCHILD
          This the guy?

                         BUNKER
          Yeah.

                         UTAH
                  (good natured)
          Okay, so this is where you tell me
          all about how locals rule and yuppie
          insects like me shouldn't be surfing
          your break and all that, right?

                         BUNKER
          No.

                         TONE
          Waste of time.

                         WARCHILD
          We're just going to fuck you up.

                         UTAH
          Oh.

As they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a
whistling roundhouse.  Its edge slams Warchild in the gut
and folds him double.  The bad news is... Warchild gets an
arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down.
The board splits into two pieces.
Utah drops his end as the others close.  A flurry of
punches and kicks, most of which he blocks.  But he's lost
the offensive.
Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style
side-kick.

TIGHT ON Utah's towel, talking with Pappas' voice.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny?  You there?

ANGELO gets out of the car fast.  He jogs twenty feet and
raises the binoculars.  Catches a glimpse of the carnage
around the edge of the building.  Breaks into a run,
massive legs pistoning.

JOHNNY HITS THE GROUND hard.  He rolls and comes up fast.
The razorhead brothers are a little surprised.

                         ARCHBOLD
          The dude can fight!

Warchild grabs Utah from behind.  Gets him in a headlock.
Archbold and Tone pin his arms.  Bunker starts working him
like a practice bag.  At this moment, Johnny is getting
the proverbial shit beat out of him.
SUDDENLY, a new figure blurs INTO FRAME.

BODHI seizes Bunker and flings him aside.  He spins with
remarkable agility and drives his heel into Warchild's
face.
Utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand.  The fight
is still there in his eyes.

Bodhi is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a
raised hand and an evil look.

                         BODHI
          Back off!  Now!!  Just let it go!

                         BUNKER
          Stay outta this, Bodhi!

                         BODHI
          He's with me.  Now back off.
          Seriously.Just do it!
                  (they relax slightly)
          You alright Warchild?

                         WARCHILD
                  (holding his bleeding
                   nose)
          Fuck you.

Everybody has backed off a bit, panting.
Utah steps toward Bunker.  Like he's maybe going to shake
hands.

                         UTAH
          What's your name?

                         BUNKER
          Bunker.

                         UTAH
          Well, listen, Bunker... I'm actually
          kinda glad you found me.

                         BUNKER
          Yeah?  Why?

Johnny answers with a LIGHTNING ROUNDHOUSE that hits with
a CRACK!  They can hear it in Pomona.
BUNKER HITS THE GROUND.  Flat out.  Lights out.
Tone, Archbold and Warchild lunge like dogs.
Bodhi yanks Utah out of the line of fire.

                         BODHI
          Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold it, ladies.  Give
          it a rest.
                  (to Utah)
          Let's go.

He literally turns Utah around.
They begin to walk, stepping over the pieces of Johnny's
board.

                         BODHI
                  (under his breath)
          Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep
          walking.

Tone starts to go after them.  Archbold grabs his arm.
They help Bunker up.  Warchild holds he bleeding nose.
Utah and Bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner and run
HEAD-ON into a huffing PAPPAS.
The big man clocks a battered but intact Utah.
We see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a
second.

                         PAPPAS
                  (out of breath)
          Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10,
          12, running with a car stereo?
          Stole the fucking CD too, you
          believe it?

Utah is grateful for the cover.

                         UTAH
          No, but there are four guys back
          there you might check out.

                         PAPPAS
          Thanks, buddy.

He shoves on.


EXT.  PARKING LOT

Bodhi and Utah weave among the cars and motorcycles,
beach-types coming and going.

                         UTAH
          Friends of yours, huh?

                         BODHI
          The one you decked is Bunker Wiess.
          The big one is his brother,
          Warchild.  The other two always
          hang.  They think they're some kinda
          death squad around here.

                         UTAH
          What's their program?

                         BODHI
          They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains
          are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing
          because they give nothing back, and
          they have no respect for the sea.
          They just want to get radical.  It's
          mindless aggression.  They'll never
          get it, the spiritual side of it.

                         UTAH
          You always talk like this?  You're
          not gonna start chanting or anything
          are you?

                         BODHI
                  (laughing)
          No.
                  (beat)
          So I was up the beach.  I saw it
          going down.  you didn't hesitate...
          they never backed you up an inch.
          That's rare in this world.

                         UTAH
          Thanks for stepping in.

                         BODHI
          De nada.

Bodhi keeps on walking as Utah reaches his car and stops.
Five paces on, he stops and turns back.  A moment of
decision...

                         UTAH
          Gonna be some people at my house
          tonight.  Maybe you can make it.

                         UTAH
          Where?

                         BODHI
          Come with Tyler.  She knows.

Bodhi turns and saunters away.  Utah considers his last
words, wondering how well Tyler and Bodhi know each other.

                                            CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  CAR - PCH - SANTA MONICA - DAY

Utah is struggling into a T-shirt as Pappas drives,
intently following a beat-to-shit JEEP.  Paramilitary
olive-drab and full of surfboards.  And razorhead.

                         PAPPAS
          Ten seconds you're out of sight.
          Unbelievable.

Johnny is equipment-juggling now... cradling a cellular
phone at his ear while steadying Pappas' binoculars in
front of his eyes.

                         UTAH
          You're losin' them.
                  (into phone)
          That's right.  Two-denver-four-sam-
          niner-five-niner.  Late seventies
          Jeep.

LONG LENS, JOHNNY'S POV through binoculars.  Bunker's jeep
weaves aggressively through traffic ahead.  Horns honk.
Tone flips off the driver of a Toyota.

                         PAPPAS
          Look, if you're gonna go leavin'
          your piece and your shield in the
          car, you can damn well stay in
          sight.  Okay?

                         UTAH
          Okay, Dad.


EXT.  VENICE STREET - DAY

Low rent street off Washington.
EXTREME LONG LENS on Jeep as it pulls onto the dead front
lawn of a brown stucco house with bars on the windows.
The razorheads get out, pulling boards and wetsuits from
the Jeep.  They are dressed now in ripped jeans, GI boots,
sleeveless Megadeth T-shirts, etc.
Watching, we become aware that two of them have brown hair
in a radical style... shaved sides and a short ponytail.

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          The jeep is registered to a Bradley
          Wiess.  My buddy.  Guy's got quite a
          sheet.
                  (into phone)
          Yeah, yeah... skip all that.  Gimme
          the greatest hits.  Misdemeanor
          possession of cocaine.  That's
          good...


INT./ EXT.  CAR

Utah on the cellular, Pappas behind the wheel as they
slide to a stop half a block from the stucco house.

                         UTAH
          ... Felony B and E, three months in
          juvey.  Better.  Felony assault.
          Postgraduate work at Chino.
          Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What
          about the brother?
                  (Utah is grinning)
          Great!  Another model citizen.
          These guys really fit the profile.

                         PAPPAS
          Remember, all bank robbers are
          losers, but not all losers are bank
          robbers.

LONG LENS POV of Razorheads house.  Through the windows we
see the four moving inside.  Tone throws Archbold and
Bunker a Coors from the fridge.  Archbold shakes his and
opens it in Warchild's face.  Warchild, in no mood, slams
him against the wall.  We feel the revved-up, chaotic
energy of the group in silent pantomime.

Bunker is met by a GIRL coming from the back of the house.
She is wearing only panties and a black leather vest.
Short black hair and tattoos stark on her white skin.
Bunker puts one arm around her neck in a head lock embrace
and slides his other hand under her vest.  Tone pulls the
curtains.

                         UTAH
          These are the guys.  I can feel it.
          I say we lay it on Harp.

EXT.  STREET NEAR HOUSE - NIGHT

TELEPHOTO VIEW of house.
Bunker and Archbold have partially disassembled the engine
of a Kawasaki 1100 parked in the living room.  They are
drinking beer and arguing about the carburetors, lit by
the blue glow of the TV.  Warchild is watching a living-
dead movie on tape.
He replays the gory parts.  Not a happening night at the
Razorheads.

REVERSE, as binoculars are lowered, revealing Cole.
WIDER, to show the dynamic team of Cole and Munoz
glowering in a plain sedan, Utah leaning in the side
window.

                         MUNOZ
          This is bullshit.  This is a
          bullshit lead.  This is totally
          bullshit.  Harp must be fucking
          desperate if he's listening to you
          two flakes.

                         UTAH
          See you bright and early, guys.

Pappas walks up with a grease-stained box.  Jams it
through the window.

                         PAPPAS
          Cold pizza?  It's great for
          breakfast.


INT./ EXT.  PAPPAS' CAR - NIGHT

Pappas pulls away from the curb, roaring past the other
agents sedan.  Utah and Cole flip each other off
perfunctorily as they pass.

                         UTAH
          When did Harp say they'd have the
          warrant?

                         PAPPAS
          He's pushing it through first thing.
          You better get some sleep tonight,
          it could be an interesting morning.

EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A bunker-like structure built of stone and glass on a
cliff overlooking the Pacific.  Surfmobiles and
motorcycles parked in front.  A strong backbeat thumps
through the open front doors.
Tyler's Porsche pulls into the driveway.  She and Johnny
get out and head for the entrance.

                         UTAH
          Nice place.

                         TYLER
          He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi
          always gets some slick place and
          throws it open to every surf burnout
          around.  Most a these guys can't
          keep a job.  When the swell comes,
          they're gone, they have to ride.


INT./ EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE

Tyler leads Utah through the steady flow of SURF-RATS and
other PCH NOMADS toward a large outdoor deck where a
barbecue is in progress.  Moonlit waves pound the shore
eighty feet below.

They are immediately distracted by the small crowd
gathering around GROMMET who has his nose pressed flat
against the center of a dart board.
His eyes swivels back to ROACH, standing fifteen feet
away, dart in hand, getting ready to throw.

                         GROMMET
          Do your worst, man!

Roach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle
point of the dart, then squints at the target.
ROSIE moves through the small crowd collecting bets.

Suddenly Roaches arm snaps back.  A collective hush...
In a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is
airborne.

TWAAAPPPPPP!  Bulls-eye.  Centimeters from flesh.  Grommet
secretly exhales.  Roach howls as Rosie rains money on his
head.
The crowd goes wild.
BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over.

                         UTAH
          Don't you gamble?

                         BODHI
          Only make bets I can't afford to
          lose.  Only way to be 100%
          committed.

With that, Bodhi smiles, then he and the woman vanish into
the crowd.  Utah watches them go, turns to Tyler.

                         UTAH
          Who's the girl?

                         TYLER
          Catch of the day.

                         UTAH
          Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.

                         TYLER
          People are expendable to Bodhi.

                         UTAH
          Meaning you were expendable.

                         TYLER
                  (shrugs)
          We went out for about five
          minutes... which is four minutes
          longer than most of them.  But you
          can't hold it against him, he's...
          different.

                         UTAH
          Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".

                         TYLER
                  (she chuckles)
          Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a
          higher plane of existence, or
          something.
                  (thoughtful)
          Maybe he has.  You've seen him
          surf... that frenzy.  It seems like
          anger.  It's not.  It's the energy
          of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman
          in his life.  She's his only true
          lover.

Utah studies her a moment.  He's caught the faintest hint
of regret in her voice.  But also the straight-ahead
pragmatism.  He looks down at the waves pounding
mercilessly against the rocks.

                         UTAH
          All she does is beat the shit out of
          me.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

PARTY - LATER

Lingering surf-rats stoned and drunk.
Nathaniel stands on the railing of the deck, Corona in
hand, gazing out at the black water.  He grins sloppily,
body wavering dangerously as he hunkers down into a
surfing stance.

                         NATHANIEL
                  (beer soaked speech)
          ... Okay, so you're in the face,
          it's twenty-five feet straight down,
          your balls are about this big.
                  (like he's holding up
                   two BB's)
          And the whole thing's moving, right,
          roaring like you're stuck to the
          front of a freight train.  There
          ain't nothin' like it, man.  The
          ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it
          doesn't even come close.

                         ROACH
          You lose it right then, you're
          history.  The fish'll be pickin' you
          outta the coral.

Nathaniel cackles that absurd Pee-Wee Herman laugh.  He
starts to flail, arms pinwheeling.
Utah catches him by the back of the shorts and pulls him
back.  Nathaniel spins and drops clumsily onto the deck.

                         NATHANIEL
                  (matter of factly)
          Thanks, brah.

Tyler sits next to Johnny, sipping a beer.  Bodhi is not
in sight.

                         ROACH
          See, it's all dynamic, it's all in
          motion.  You can't just stop and
          walk on in to the beach if you don't
          like the way things are going, y'
          know what I mean?  You gotta ride it
          out man, all the way.

                         GROMMET
          You ride the monsters, you gotta
          know you're ridin' a line between
          life and death.  There ain't no
          forgiveness.

                         UTAH
          So what's the biggest?  Waimea?

                         BODHI (V.O.)
          No, Bells Beach, Australia.

Bodhi glides into the group and sits, his expression dark
and enigmatic.  The beautiful girl kneels behind him,
massaging his neck.  He seems not to notice.

                         GROMMET
          Shit, yeah!  I remember that day...
          gnarly fuckin' ass!  Was your
          birthday--

                         ROACH
          The set was northwest.  Jacking up
          like a fucking mountain of gray
          glass--

                         BODHI
          I made that one mistake you pray
          you'll never make--

                         NATHANIEL
          You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it
          was like he fell for-ever.  Then the
          curl crashes down and he's gooone--

                         GROMMET
          -- held down in the washing machine,
          man... it was severe, we couldn't
          see nothin' thought it was all over
          for sure--

Nathaniel HOWLS.
Tyler watches Utah watching Bodhi.  Notices how he is
mesmerized by these war stories.  Bodhi smiles,
unexpectedly.

                         BODHI
          Not tragic to die doing what you
          love.  You want the ultimate thrill,
          you gotta be willing to pay the
          ultimate price.

                         NATHANIEL
          Fuckin' A.

                         GROMMET
                  (draining a Corona)
          Hell, I ain't gonna see 30.

He and Nathaniel slap a warm, brotherly handshake.
Utah notices that Tyler is giving him a dark look.
She gets up suddenly and walks away from the group.

                         UTAH
                  (to the surfers,
                   covering)
          Uh.  I need another beer.

He heads out after Tyler.


INT.  HALLWAY - DEN

Johnny moves through the house, looking for her.  As he
passes the den, he sees Tyler standing inside, and goes
into the dark room.
It is the only personalized space we have seen in the
house.
A kind of shrine to the Bodhisattva.
Shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels.
Maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet
across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety
of tribal artifacts and marine specimens.
The books include political literature, eastern religion,
philosophy.  A strange hodgepodge of titles and authors:
Nietzsche, Marx, the Tao, "Steal this Book", "The Book of
Five Rings", Frederick Forsyth thrillers.

Tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and Johnny walks
up behind her.  Shots of Bodhi surfing a monster wave,
mountain-biking, skydiving, flying an ultralight airplane,
bungee-cord jumping, cliff diving.
Every kamikaze activity in the book.

                         TYLER
          Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.
          I hope you're not buying into this
          banzai-bullshit like the rest of
          Bodhi's moonies.

                         UTAH
          What are you talking about?

                         TYLER
          I've seen that kamikaze look,
          Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi
          can smell it a mile away.  He'll
          take you to the edge... and past it.
                  (she looks past
                   Johnny, sees
                   something)
          Hey, Bodhi.

Utah turns.  Bodhi is in the doorway.

                         BODHI
          Johnny has his own demons, don't
          you, Johnny?

Bodhi seems to stare into him.
Utah breaks the look.  Turns back to the photo gallery.
Bodhi's eyes swivel.  He ponders something.  Looks at
Tyler.

                         BODHI
          Feel it?

Roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway,
wondering what happened to their leader.  He turns to
them.

                         BODHI
          Gentlemen, it's time.

HOOT AND CHEERS.  Everyone bursts into motion.  Yelling
and running through the house.

                         UTAH
          What's goin' on?

                         TYLER
          Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always
          knows.

Bodhi returns from another room with... AN ALL-BLACK
SURFBOARD.  It gleams like obsidian.  Near the tip, in
small gray letters it says "Stealth Fighter".  Bodhi
thrusts it into Johnny's hands.
The others WHOOP maniacally.
Johnny feels the challenge.  The pull of the tribe.

                         BODHI
          Let's go, Utah.  Time for a little
          stealth mission.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LATIGO BEACH - NIGHT

SIX DARK FIGURES walk toward us out of shafts of light...
the headlights of Bodhi's CHEVY 4WD and Tyler's Porsche.
The figures are Bodhi, Johnny, Tyler and the other
surfers.
ROSIE hangs back with the idling vehicles, tattooed arms
crossed.  He puffs on a cigarette.

A WIDE SHOT (MATTE) of the beach shows a pool of light
from the headlights, beyond it a vast silver ocean under a
black sky.  The full moon casts the world in cold
monochrome.  The little figures reach the sea.

                         ROACH
                  (a voice in the
                   distance)
          Gaping barrels!  Way overhead, man!

CLOSER, as moonlit figures run into the water.
Utah stands on the beach, hoping his eyes will adjust.

                         UTAH
          I can barely do this in broad
          daylight.

                         TYLER
          Come on.  At least no one's gonna
          see how bad you are.

Johnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the
water.
He strokes powerfully out through the black swell.

UTAH'S EBONY BOARD pierces the wave and he slides down the
backside to where the others are waiting.  Roach and
Nathaniel, silhouettes nearby, see one they like and take
off yelling.
Johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him.

                         UTAH
          I gotta be fucking crazy.

                         BODHI
          Yeah, but are you crazy enough?

Grommet gets a ride, slicing across in front of them.
A ghost moving off into the silvery distance.
Tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one.  It's
Johnny's turn.

                         BODHI
          Football's a man-made game.  You
          keep score with numbers.  But in
          this, there's no field, no rules, no
          opponent.  Just you and the wave.

                         UTAH
          I know that part.  Tell me something
          I can use, here.

                         BODHI
          I've watched you once or twice.  You
          surf like it's some kind of street
          fight.  You jerk along from moment
          to moment, fighting everything that
          comes at you.  Always trying to win.

                         UTAH
          A flaw I'm working on.

                         BODHI
          The only way to win out here is to
          surrender.  You have to feel what
          the wave is doing, accept its
          energy, get in sync.  Just feel it
          all moving in the blackness... you
          don't need to see.

                         UTAH
          Yeah, right, vision is highly over-
          rated.

Bodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline.
Without looking back, he senses the incoming swell.

                         BODHI
          This one's got your name on it,
          Johnny.

Utah looks.  Huge glassy face, perfectly formed.  Black
and terrifying.

                         BODHI
          Let's go.

Bodhi digs in with both hands, driving himself forward.
Johnny starts grabbing water right behind him.  The wave
picks them up.

                         UTAH
          Shit, I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna die
          now.

Johnny uses the patented Tyler-pop and makes it to his
feet.  Suddenly he's going like a shot.
He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down.
Maintains a fragile control.
On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in
behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black
face.

Bodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the
moonlight.
Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little
forward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed.

Johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning
that he can make long floating turns up and down the
glassy face.

Feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling
up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a
little of it.

The Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the
night.
Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face.
Bodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up.
Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom,
slashing back and climbing.
Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the
speed.
He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling.
The grin dropping off his face.

He falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them
like a great black wing.

TYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her.
Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo
wolf as they go by.
She grins to herself, watching him.
Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for
life.


EXT.  BEACH PARKING LOT

Rosie sits on the sand next to a blazing fire in a cement
firepit.

ANGLE THROUGH THE HEAT HAZE above the flames.  Tyler
punches through, a few feet away.  She paddles toward him,
coming alongside.

                         TYLER
          You had enough?

                         UTAH
          Yeah.  I just want to sit out here
          for a minute.

He watches the lights along the shoreline as the gentle
swell between sets lifts and drops them.  His face is
somehow childlike.
A slow grin spreads itself across his face.

                         TYLER
          Look at you.

                         UTAH
          What?

                         TYLER
          Well, usually you have this sort of
          intense scowl of concentration, like
          you're doing this for a school
          project or something... I don't
          know, like something's driving you.
                  (she puts her
                   fingertip to  his
                   forehead)
          See, it's gone.  If I didn't know
          better I'd say you looked almost
          happy.

                         UTAH
          I... I don't know.  I can't describe
          what I'm feeling.

                         TYLER
                  (smiling)
          You don't have to.

Her face seems luminous in the moonlight.  The ocean
silver.  The shore a shimmering line of gold.  The sky
black velvet.

Utah turns to Tyler, eyes exploring her, as in a dream.
Water beads on her dark skin like crawling diamonds.
He glides closer, holding her board like an uneasy horse
alongside his.
He runs his fingertips down her arm.

                         UTAH
          Goosebumps.  Come here.

She leans closer and he rubs his hands up and down her
arms, warming her.  His hands stop on her shoulders.
He pulls her to his mouth.  Her tongue meets his.
She wants this.
He is surprised by the fierceness of her kiss, which
overwhelms his.

TIGHT ON THE ZIPPER of her shorty wetsuit as Johnny's
fingers draw it down.  Slowly down, to where it ends
between her legs.
He spreads the front and slips his hands inside, along her
ribs.

                         TYLER
          Those are cold.

                         UTAH
          Warm them up.

She moves his strong hand onto her breast.
His fingers massage her cold-stiffened nipple.
She moans and grabs his wet hair in her other hand,
pulling him into another intense kiss.


EXT.  OCEAN - UNDERWATER

Looking up from the bottom,  we see the silhouettes of two
boards surrounded by pulsing shafts of moonlight.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN to show the bottom.
The dreamlike blue light shimmering on the sand and rocks.
A big shark browses gracefully, ignoring the lovers.
Their moment of harmony with the sea will be honored.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Tyler's Porsche stands alone in an empty lot.
Her surfboard sticks up in back, next to Utah's "stealth
fighter".
Rosie's fire is burning low.
Tyler, half-wrapped in a blanket from the car, straddles
Johnny on the sand like she straddles her board.  The
blanket slips down.
Naked silhouettes in the firelight.
She arches her back as they move together in prefect sync.
Grips his shoulders and stares into his face, her teeth
bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain.
She makes love like she does everything... with honesty
and intensity.
Utah, surprisingly, is gentle and slow.
He strokes her hair after she collapses onto him.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BEACH - DAWN

ECU JOHNNY as he cracks one eye open, registering the dawn
light.
He bolts up, looking around.  Tyler is asleep beside him,
with the quilt from the car pulled up tight to her chin.
She looks radiant in sleep.
He grabs his watch out of the sand and looks at it.

                         UTAH
          Holy shit.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND RAZORHEAD HOUSE

LONG LENS on UTAH'S SEDAN fishtailing through the alley,
narrowly missing dumpsters and parked cars.
He pulls up next to several unmarked FBI sedans.  No one
in sight.

UTAH jumps out tucking in yesterday's shirt, stuffing his
Beretta into his waistband.  He also shoves a small
leather case into his belt.

Utah pulls open the door to one of the unmarked cars and
rips a walkie-talkie out of the charging rack on the front
seat.
Running, he passes a gate.  Goes back.  Looks.

HIS POV -- FOUR MEN huddled behind a garage.  COLE, MUNOZ,
AND TWO OTHER AGENTS.  All with guns and walkie-talkies.

                         UTAH
                  (whispering)
          You guys need any help?

                         COLE
                  (not amused)
          You're late.

We hear Pappas' voice over the radio.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          Did that worthless punk partner of
          mine ever show up?

                         UTAH
                  (grinning)
          Right here, partner.


EXT.  STREET - NEARBY

Pappas has his shirt hiked up as another agent, BABBIT,
tapes a microphone transmitter to his stomach.  Pappas
talks into his top button.

                         PAPPAS
          Good of you to join us, hotshot.
                  (to Babbit)
          Watch it.  I told you, not on the
          hairs, goddammit.

Babbit moves the transmitter, putting the tape on
differently.

                         UTAH
          I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where
          you want me?

                         PAPPAS
          Cole and Munoz are going in the back
          door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I
          want you at the side window by the
          hedge.  You're strictly backup, got
          it?

                         UTAH
          Got it.

                         PAPPAS
          Awright.  Get into position.  I'm
          rolling.

Pappas pulls the loose Hawaiian shirt down over the radio-
mike gear and his stalwart .38 snub.
He steps out from behind a fence and walks along the
sidewalk toward Bunker's house, two doors down.  He is
wearing polyester shorts and sandals, and carrying a DOG
LEASH.

                         PAPPAS
          Here Scooby!  Where are you boy?
          Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of
          shit.

COLE AND MUNOZ snap around the corner of the garage and
sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house.

UTAH circles back out through the alley.  TRACKING WITH
HIM as he makes it to the neighbor's back hedge and crab-
walks toward Bunker's house.  BABBIT and ANOTHER AGENT
make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying
out of sight of the windows.

ANGELO is walking up to the falling-down porch of this
low-rent roach-hotel.

JOHNNY is elbow-crawling between the house and a tall
hedge.
He slides quietly in below a bedroom window.
He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his
waistband.  Removes something from it.  A DENTAL MIRROR.
Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling
it where he can see inside.

TIGHT ON DENTAL MIRROR, Johnny's POV.
We see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind.
Tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones.  Cranked up
speedmetal.
His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat
like karate on 40,000 volts.
The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl
can be made out behind rippled shower glass.

TIGHT ON DOORBELL as Pappas rings it.

UTAH JUMPS at an explosion of sound.  He spins in a
microsecond, pistol aimed at... A LAWN MOWER.
Through the hedge we can just see THE NEIGHBOR, sixtyish
and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring
machine about two feet from Johnny's face.  Utah exhales
and lowers the gun.  Wipes sweat from his eyes.

TIGHT ON PAPPAS, smiling open-faced and goofily charming
as...

THE DOOR opens, revealing a GIRL we haven't seen before.
She has hair like bleached fiberglass, black eye-makeup
and nails.  Ramones-style wardrobe.  She looks tense, and
won't open the door very far.

                         FIBERGLASS
          Yeah?  What?

                         PAPPAS
          Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of
          a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About
          this big.

                         FIBERGLASS
          No.

UTAH blinks at what he sees.

HIS POV, in the little mirror.
Like a silent pantomime under the ROAR OF THE MOWER, he
sees Bunker and Warchild come flying into the room.
They are hyper and manic.  Eyes wild.
Bunker leaps clear over the bed.
Grabs a COMBAT SHOTGUN from the closet.  Throws it to
Warchild.  Tone is oblivious.
Bunker thumps him in the chest and Tone leaps up like an
overwound toy, gaping "What the fuck?!" we read his lips
saying.
Bunker grabs a STEYR ASSAULT RIFLE, white knuckled, while
Tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 COLT AUTO.

                         UTAH
                  (into his headset)
          Babbit.  Get Angelo out of there.
          They're pulling out a fucking
          arsenal!  Babbit, you copy?  Cole?
          Don't let him pull his badge!


EXT.  BACK YARD

Cole and Munoz push their earpieces in deeper.  Scowl.

                         MUNOZ
          Utah, say again.  What?
                  (to Cole)
          I can't hear jack shit over this
          lawnmower.  Christ.


INT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE

In the bedroom, Bunker looks through a slit of door at
Fiberglass.  We hear Pappas just outside.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          ... and the guy next door said he
          saw it go into your backyard.  My
          wife'll kill me if I lose the little
          bastard.  Me, I could care less.
          Whole house smells from it's liftin'
          its leg all the time...

Bunker looks like he's on paranoia overdrive.

                         BUNKER
          Something's goin' down, man.  This
          ain't right.

                         TONE
                  (freaked)
          No, man, it's nothin'.  It's
          nothin'.

                         BUNKER
          Will you shut the fuck up!  Check
          the windows.  Do it!!


EXT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE

Utah sucks up against the wall as Warchild looks furtively
out the window.  We see them both, but Warchild doesn't
see Johnny, plastered right below him.
Johnny closes his eyes and grits his teeth.  Shiiiiittt!

PAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, is bobbing his head, trying to
look inside.

                         PAPPAS
          You sure he isn't out back?  You
          mind if I go take a look?

                         FIBERGLASS
          Look, I don't know anything about
          your dog, okay--

                         PAPPAS
          Well is there anyone else here that
          might have seen him?

                         FIBERGLASS
          There's nobody else here...


INT.  HOUSE

Warchild slams into the wall next to Bunker.

                         WARCHILD
          There's two guys by the back door.
          Ducked down.

                         TONE
          Oh, shit.  Shit!!  We're fucked,
          man.

                         BUNKER
          That fat fuck comes through the door
          I'm gonna pump him up.  Swear to
          Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude
          up!

Scared and vicious, like a cornered dog.  We believe him.
Bunker jacks the bolt on the Steyr.  Warchild cocks the
shotgun.


EXT.  HOUSE

JOHNNY is pissing himself.  He can see it all going down.
So fast he doesn't have time to think.
He goes into motion -- slipping rapidly along the wall to
the next window.
The bathroom window.

PAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, makes his move.
He pushes the door open, breaking the security chain, and
jams his FBI shield in the girl's face as he grabs her
arm.

                         PAPPAS
          FBI, gorgeous.  Now let's take a
          look around--


INT.  HOUSE

Bunker's eyes bug out as he sees Pappas coming through the
door.  He snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder.
Suddenly Johnny is behind him -- half-in the bathroom
window, pistol gripped double-handed like they taught him
in Quantico.

                         UTAH
          FBI!!  DROP IT!

Bunker whips around.  Squeezing off a wild burst!  B-B-B-
BLAM!
It rips the plaster next to Johnny's shoulder.
Shatters the shower door behind him.  The BLACK-HAIRED
GIRL screams.
Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY.  Wild.
Bunker drops, hit.
Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge.  KABOOM!
Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by
Johnny's head.
Deafening in the confined space.
Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe.
Tone just splits.  Down the hall like a greyhound.

PAPPAS is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding
Fiberglass in a neck-lock with one massive arm.
Bunker, wild-eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the
bathroom doorway.
He raises the Steyr.  Mistake.

Angelo FIRES.  30 years in the field tends to show.
Three rounds.  Chest.  Chest.  Head.
Bunker is off the planet.

MUNOZ KICKS THE BACKDOOR IN like they do in the movies.
He and Cole charge into the rancid kitchen.  Badass FBI
agents.

JOHNNY, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot
around the doorframe.  He gets a glimpse of Warchild's
back disappearing into the hallway.  FIRES.  His shot is
wasted, punching plaster.

Suddenly a pink freight-train hits him.
He forgot about the girl in the shower.
Naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face-first
into the wall.
As he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and
hammers his head into the medicine-cabinet -- CRASH --
shattering the mirror.
Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the
wall into her.
She drives her elbow into his back as he drops.
"FREIGHT TRAIN" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and
viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot.  It
skitters under the bed.

She's cut up from flying glass.  Demon-eyed and wired, her
body lithe and muscular under white skin.  She sprints
across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for
breath.

IN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway.
White-knuckling the forty-five.  A wild-eyed kid with a
big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it.
He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins.
It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun.

                         WARCHILD
          Move it, man.  Let's get the fuck
          out of here!

Off-guard, Tone is SLAMMED BY THE DOOR as Munoz drives
into it with his shoulder.
Pounded between the door and wall, Tone is wired so tight
he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own
right foot.
He screams and drops to the floor.
Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on
Warchild, who dives into a doorway.
Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds
down the corridor.

Cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on
Warchild.
"Freight-train" appears behind him from another door.
She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his
back up to the hilt.
Pulls them out, going for another stab, when--
Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the
wall.

UTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field
of vision.
On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive.  Johnny leaps
the bed and goes ballistic.  His flying tackle catches
Warchild at the window.


EXT.  HOUSE

The window EXPLODES OUTWARD in a spray of sunlit glass.
Utah and Warchild crash to the ground.
The razorhead, with 50 pounds on Johnny, rises like a
bull.
Bleeding from superficial lacerations, Warchild plows
through the hedge.
Johnny dives after him.
The Polyester Neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed
figures careen toward him.  He is knocked flying, and the
ROARING LAWNMOWER is flipped onto its side.

Utah and Warchild are locked together.
The shotgun lies nearby, out of play.
Warchild jerks a 6 INCH KNIFE free from its sheath,
hanging from a thong around his neck.  He trusts straight
at Johnny's throat.
Johnny deflects the thrust -- INTO THE WHIRLING LAWNMOWER.
KA-WHANGGG!!!  The knife is hammered out of Warchild's
hand.
Whistles away, spinning.

Warchild grabs Johnny as they scramble, and heaves him
bodily toward the spinning blade.  Utah catches the rim of
the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from
the rotor.
Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny.
Pushing him face-first toward the blades.
Johnny feels the wind on his face.
The engine is roaring, full throttle.

PAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM.
He aims the .38.  FIRES TWICE.
The little Briggs & Stratton dies young, its casing
shattered.
The rotor spins to a stop.
Warchild looks up into the black eye of Pappas' gun.
Two inched from his face.

                         PAPPAS
          Speak into the microphone.

The razorhead sags, the fight going out of him.
Babbit kicks him off Johnny, face down onto the lawn.
Cuffs him.


INT.  BATHROOM - BEDROOM - LATER

UTAH dry heaves over the sink.  Turns the faucet on full
blast and hoses his head.  He lifts a dripping face, wipes
water out of his eyes, stops on the reflection in the
mirror.  Pappas is there.

                         PAPPAS
          It's always been lasers and paper
          targets until today, right?

Utah looks up at him and nods.  He glances through the
doorway at Bunker, dead in a pool of blood.  Tone is
wailing as paramedics work on his foot.  Cole is being
taken out on a stretcher.

                         PAPPAS
          No difference, Utah.  Just a little
          more to clean up.
                  (squeezes the
                   rookie's  shoulder)
          It's alright.  You did good today.

Across the bedroom AGENT BABBIT rips the back off a big
speaker unit.  Behind it, taped to the woofer, are two
large packets of a white substance.

                         PAPPAS
          Oh shit.

Utah stares at the dope.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE HQ - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT ON WARCHILD manacled to the chair screaming his head
off.  We cannot hear him through the glass.  It looks like
pantomime.

UTAH and PAPPAS watch through the one way observation
window.
THWAAAAAP!!  The two taped packets slam the wall inches
from Utah's right ear.  Johnny snaps his head around.
Stares into the face of DIETZ who looks like Warchild's
meaner brother.
And he's pissed as hell...

                         DIETZ
          You know what this is?!  Two keys
          uncut crystal meth!

                         UTAH
          What the hell's your problem?

Dietz manically grabs a clump of his stringy hair.

                         DIETZ
          You think I like this haircut?  My
          wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I
          been working on these guys for THREE
          MONTHS!  Finally -- finally--
                  (nodding to Warchild)
          -- I get dickwad in there wantin' to
          play wheel of fortune so I can find
          out their supplier!

HARP emerges from the interrogation room, we hear a sliver
of Warchild's battle cry.  He spies Utah.

                         HARP
          This is agent Dietz, DEA.  He's got
          a record of your suspect's movements
          every day for the last three months.

                         DIETZ
                  (stabbing the air
                   with the packets)
          All I wanna know is how are these
          guys supposed to be holding up
          Tarzana City National on August 2nd,
          when they are in Fort-fucking-
          Lauderdale August 2ND!!!

                         HARP
          Not an easy thing to do, is it,
          Utah?

                         UTAH
          Aw shit.

                         PAPPAS
          Nice tattoo, Dietz.

We hear a faint BUZZ, growing louder as we...

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

The doorbell BUZZ shrieks through the room.  It stops.
Starts again.  A ghostly dawn finds UTAH and TYLER
sleeping peacefully, limbs entwined like vines.
Johnny's eyes snap open.  Spies the clock.  4:00 a.m.
Tyler stirs beside him, coming out of sleep.
Johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to
the door.

BODHI stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin.
Behind him NATHANIEL, ROACH and GROMMET hoot from the
pickup.

                         BODHI
          C'mon brah, there's a righteous
          swell.  Let's go!  Let's go!

Tyler comes into the room, wrapped in a sheet.
Utah sees her knowing smile.

                         TYLER
          He does this.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  BEACH - PREDAWN

Vampire morning.  A misty predawn, bled of all color.
Steel gray tones.  The ocean vanishes in the fog a few
feet from shore.
Tyler and Johnny, carrying their boards, walk toward the
water.

                         TYLER
          Come on, Utah.  Everybody's out
          there catchin' all the good rides.

She realizes he has stopped ten feet behind her, like a
great weight has dragged him to a halt.

                         TYLER
          What's wrong Johnny?
                  (goes back to him)
          You're like a different person.

He stares at her.  His expression dark... wrestling with
something.

                         UTAH
          I am a different person, Tyler.

He lets out a long breath and looks away, out to sea.

JOHNNY'S POV... the water receding into a backlit wall of
mist.
FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the fog.
Shades of gray in the gray.
IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically across the screen,
their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each
other.

STACKED UP BY THE EXTREME LONG LENS, Bodhi, Roach, Grommet
and Nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical
grace.

In SUSPENDED TIME we see them hooting and grinning at each
other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other.
Dolphins playing.
Challenging each other in mock combat.
So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to
spare.
There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration.
Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art.
For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe,
by themselves.  It dawns on us...
There are four of them.
And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi,
laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty
wig-wagging moon.

TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open.
Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward
him.

IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel's
shining white butt.

ON JOHNNY, as he reacts to the dawning certainty.
He feels weak, dizzy... like the ground is moving under
him.

                         TYLER
          Hey.  You okay?  You look like you
          saw a ghost.

SHOCK CUT -- ANGELO TURNING TOWARD HIM, at the drop car
scene.  Eons ago.  The sound of his voice ringing...

                         PAPPAS
          Forget about it, kid, They're
          ghosts...

BACK TO JOHNNY, as he backs away from Tyler.  Still in
shock, recoiling from the situation.

                         UTAH
          I... I gotta go.

                         TYLER
          Johnny... what's going on?  I don't
          get it... did I do something?

                         UTAH
          No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go.
          I'll, uh... I'll call you later.
          I'm sorry.

He sets off running up the beach.
Tyler stares after him.  Confused and hurt.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PAPPAS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Early evening.  Utah pulls into the driveway.  When he
kills the engine we hear Greek music from inside the
house.

AT THE ENTRANCE Johnny finds the door ajar.  He pushes it
open a little to reveal--


INT.  HOUSE

Pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt
off, holding a glass of ouzo.  Facing away from the door
the ample Greek hears Utah's tentative knock.  Without
breaking from his dance or turning he calls out--

                         PAPPAS
          Hey, babe.  Get on over here so the
          big dog can teach ya how to bark.

Pappas howls like a bloodhound, then twirls around.

                         UTAH
          Woof, woof.

We see the startled Pappas, at a loss for the first time.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call
          first, you know?  Hey, where the
          hell were you all day?  You gotta at
          least call in or something.  You
          okay?

                         UTAH
          Angelo, we gotta talk.

Pappas moves toward him, kind of subconsciously herding
Utah back out the door.

                         PAPPAS
          Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it
          wait till tomorrow morning, kid,
          I...

Johnny hears footsteps and turns.
Miss Deer comes through the door like it's not the first
time, carrying a bag of groceries.

                         MISS DEER
          Angie, they didn't have the kind of
          wine you like but I got... oh, hi
          Johnny!

Her icy office persona obviously got left there.  Her hair
is unbound and flows around her shoulders, and in halter
top and jeans she looks delectably off-duty.

Angelo looks at Utah like don't you say a fucking word.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  HOUSE

A few minutes later.  Utah and Pappas leaning on his car.
The younger agent seems to have regained his hunt-down
fever.

                         UTAH
          ... so I started tailing him.

                         PAPPAS
          This Zen master surfer.

                         UTAH
          Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day,
          right.  He goes here, he goes there,
          he goes to Tower Records and buys
          come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's
          Road House...
                  (mock casual)
          ... he goes into the Assured Trust
          Savings and Loan.

                         PAPPAS
          Did he rob it?

                         UTAH
          Cute.  He was inside for about 20
          minutes.  The other guy, Roach,
          waited in the truck.  They were
          scoping it out, right?!

                         UTAH
          Yeah, or cashing a check.

                         UTAH
          Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back
          to their beach house and box up all
          their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's
          truck and take it to a public
          storage unit.  You see?  Summer's
          almost over.  They're splitting.
          They're gonna pick up a little
          traveling money tomorrow.  The next
          day at the outside latest.  I got a
          feeling.

                         PAPPAS
          Last time you got a feeling I had to
          kill a man, which I always hate
          because it looks bad on the report.

                         UTAH
          Angelo... I'm right this time.  We
          can still win this one.

Angelo looks at the conviction in the other agent's eyes.
Pappas sighs and puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder.

                         PAPPAS
          Alright, look... banks are closed.
          Nothing's gonna go down tonight,
          right?  So we'll be on these guys
          like white on rice... first thing
          tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow.
          Okay?

Utah nods.  Then grins.  Pappas starts backing up, like a
long rubber band which was stretched taut is pulling him
back into the house.

                         UTAH
          Woof, woof.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET NEAR BODHI'S HOUSE - DAY

LONG LENS POV scanning Bodhi's house.  There is a "FOR
RENT" sign out front.  The driveway and carpet are
empty... no vehicles in sight.

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          They're gone.  Son of a bitch.  We
          missed them.

UTAH LOWERS HIS BINOCULARS.  He's standing next to the car
while Pappas sits on the hood, sipping coffee from a
thermos.

                         PAPPAS
          They're on their way to Maui.

                         UTAH
          No way.  Not yet.  Come on.

Utah jumps in and starts the car.  Pappas is screwing the
cap on the thermos.  Johnny puts the car in gear, forcing
Angelo to scramble in as the car starts to roll.

                         PAPPAS
          Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't
          open 'till nine.


EXT.  CITY STREET - TRAFFIC - DAY

Johnny weaves the sedan among the creeping commuters.
Long glittering lines and heat waves.

                         UTAH
          I say we call it in.  Get some
          backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp
          won't listen to me.

                         PAPPAS
          Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call
          up and tell him his favorite agent
          saw this one surfer moon another
          surfer yesterday and it looked real
          suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably
          call out the National Guard.

                         UTAH
          I say we don't call it in.  Under no
          circumstance are we to call this in.

                         PAPPAS
          Look, we handle it ourselves, for
          right now, okay?  We cover the bank,
          whatever.  You and me.  That way if
          nothing happens, or more accurately,
          when nothing happens... I don't get
          my tits any further into the wringer
          than they already are.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  ASSURED TRUST SAVING AND LOAN

SLOW PAN from the facade of the bank halfway up the block
to Utah's sedan in the TIGHT F.G.  Head flopped back over
the seat, Angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page
over his face.  Johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth
time.  Whole lot of nothing going on.

Angelo slides the sports page down to his chin, without
otherwise moving.

                         PAPPAS
          Time for lunch.

                         UTAH
          Angelo, it's eleven thirty.

                         PAPPAS
          That place up the street has
          meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.

Utah slides out of the car.  Feeling a little exposed he
pulls his Dodgers cap down a little tighter, and adjusts
his sunglasses.
He trudges off through the sidewalk crowd toward the FAST-
FOOD STAND nearby.
Pappas pulls the sports page back up to block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  FAST FOOD PLACE

ON A LONG LENS, very stacked up, we see Johnny standing at
the grody pick-up window.  He keeps looking at the bank,
visible B.G.
The pick-up window opens and food appears, sliding out.
Utah turns, pulling out his wallet.

                         VOICE FROM INSIDE
          Two meatball, one tuna on wheat,
          two lemonades.  Total's seven eighty
          four.

As Johnny is counting out the bills, a BURGUNDY
THUNDERBIRD pulls up in front of the bank.  The doors fly
open.
The Ex-Presidents jump out.
They sprint for the entrance.  All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G.
Johnny misses it as he picks up the food order.
The Presidents disappear inside.
Johnny looks toward the bank again.  There is no movement.

REVERSE, as Utah walks back toward his car.  Pappas is
still under the paper.  He slides it down when he smells
food.

                         UTAH
          Here, yours is the one that looks
          like a road kill.  Enjoy.

Utah throws a big stack of napkins through the window into
Pappas' lap.  Still standing next to the car.

                         UTAH
          Here's your lemonade.
                  (he looks down the
                   street)
          Did you see that T-Bird pull up?

Pappas pulls a disgusting mass from the bag, unwrapping
one end.

                         PAPPAS
                  (without looking)
          Damn, I could eat the ass out of an
          elephant.  I shoulda had you get me
          three a these.  What T-Bird?

Pappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls
out of the end of the sandwich.  It lands on the seat next
to him.
He looks at it.  Picks it up.  Pops it into his mouth
and--
Freezes, mouth open.  Eyes focused on...
The Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the
doors of the bank 80 feet away.

Johnny is so astounded he doesn't do anything for about
two seconds.  Pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes
bugging.

                         PAPPAS
          Jesus Christ!!  It's them!

The Presidents are piling into the car.
Johnny reacts characteristically.  He whips out the
Beretta and yells--

                         UTAH
          FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right now!

NIXON spins, raising his shotgun.
But Reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand.  Shoves
him into the car.  Then Reagan jumps behind the wheel.
The back wheels light up, smoking, as the T-Bird launches.

Utah FIRES.
BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!
He puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into
junk jewelry.  The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping
a Subaru which locks them up and spins.

                         PAPPAS
          Come on, kid, get in the car!
          Jesus!


INT./ EXT.  SEDAN

Pappas reaches across, starting the engine as Johnny jumps
in the driver's side.  Utah buries the throttle into the
firewall and charges aggressively through the medium
traffic.
Their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler,
fishtailing.  It straightens out.  No T-Bird in sight.

                         UTAH
          The hell are they?!

                         PAPPAS
          They took a left at the next light!

                         UTAH
          You sure?!

Utah is totally wired.  Totally concentrated.  The
adrenalin is kicking in, flashing through his system.  His
brain is on turbo boost, reacting a thousand times a
second as they hit sixty through the traffic, which seems
to be standing still.

                         UTAH
          I got 'em.  I see 'em.  I'm on it,
          I'm on it.

High-speed slalom through cars and trucks.
The world passes by in a hysterical blur.

                         PAPPAS
          You even watching the road?

A car pulls out, straight ahead.
Utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him.  The guy's
bumper and front grille are removed.  Utah does a smoking
skid-recovery.  Doesn't even slow down.

The late model T-Bird is weaving manically.  It makes a
sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the
FBI agents.

Utah cuts the wheel into a huge Ralph's parking lot.
Pedestrians scatter.  Utah center-punches a week's supply
of groceries in a cart.


INT./ EXT.  T-BIRD

The Presidents hold on desperately as Reagan white-
knuckles it through civilian traffic.  They're looking all
around, trying to see where Utah went.

                         LBJ
          Where are they, man?  I don't see
          'em.  We lose 'em?

Not exactly... THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see an airborne
Utah hurtling from a Ralph's entrance.  The sedan lands on
the street, tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the
undercarriage.
An instant later it hammers into the side of the T-Bird.

The two cars spin out of control.  Utah cuts the wheel,
slamming into them again.  Side by side demolition derby.
WHAM!!  Utah hits them again.  The Presidents lose
control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in
the process.

Utah's car starts to swap ends.  Hit the center island
broadside.
The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass.
SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest.
Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off.

                         PAPPAS
          Nice fuckin' work, hotshot.
          Christ!

They can see the T-Bird still moving.
It slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on
flapping rubber.

Johnny shimmies out of the wreckage, sliding on his back
in broken glass.  Pappas is packed in, upside down,
wriggling to get out through the side window.  A tight
fit.


INT./ EXT.  T-BIRD

The Presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing
tire.

                         REAGAN
          Emergency sanitization!  Here we go!


EXT.  GAS STATION

The T-Bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a
smoking stop at one of the pump islands.  The Presidents
explode out of the car in a blur.

Reagan bodyslams a TEENAGER putting gas in his MUSTANG.
He flips his big pistol to LBJ as the other Presidents
charge past him.  Nixon jumps behind the wheel of the
Mustang.  LBJ and JFK pile in.

Reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car.
He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER.
Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the
zippo below and slightly in front of it.  He flicks the
flame.
Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle.

Like an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENTY
FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant.
Any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated.
Customers are running, screaming.
Nixon has the Mustang fired up.

                         NIXON
          Let's go!  Move it, Ronny!

Ronny's eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the
scene with the jet of fire.  You can see it getting good
to him.  In a second he's going to blow up the whole
block.  But he's getting his rocks off.  He sets two other
cars on fire.

A FIGURE BLURS INTO FRAME.
In a flying tackle, Utah catapults Reagan off his pins.
They roll, skidding across the oily concrete.
Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island.

Out of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull,
his snubnose held high.  NIXON sees him and floors it.
The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots
blow out the back window.

Utah and Reagan roll away from the blaze.  Johnny's pants
are burning.  He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's
kick to take him square in the solar plexus.  He folds in
half.  Drops to the cement.
Reagan kicks him again and takes off running.
The President is burning.
His suit jacket is ablaze.  He shucks out of it as he
runs.

Gasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans.  Puts himself
out.  He comes up running, pulling his Beretta.  Sees the
back of Reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind
the gas station.


EXT.  ALLEY

A non-descript L.A. alley... commercial buildings on one
side, walled suburb on the other.  Two men running all
out.
A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like
a crashing jet fighter.

Beyond the buildings behind them A FIREBALL EXPLODES
SKYWARD.  We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the
two pelt along the alley.  It gets quieter.  Just the
machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard
breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out
in long blurring strides.

REAGAN looks back.  Sees the demon cop behind him,
gaining.
Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut
mode.

AHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley.
Reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off
its hinges.  Utah whips through the gate a second later.
Diving into suburbia.


INT./ EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE

It becomes a blur.  Pure kinetic energy.  Two meteors
rocketing through a low-rent suburb.  And God help anyone
who gets in the way.

Reagan crosses a cluttered backyard.
Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god-
knows-what.
He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of
spray.
Crashes through a hedge.
Through the narrow gap between houses.
Utah powers into the tight space behind him.
Blurring along between stucco walls.

They emerge into the front yard.
A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and
falls down.
Reagan and Utah both hurdle her.

AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk.
Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two.
He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking
teenagers.
He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear.

Reagan flashes across the sunlit street.
Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the
brakes.
It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back.
The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the
truck.
Knocks him sprawling.
Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back.
Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the
figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of
hyperkinetic video game.

Everything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato
impressions.
The house across the street is blocked by fence on both
sides.
A MAN is picking up his mail.
Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of
the house.
Utah follows.

Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway.
A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts
past her, knocking her flying.
Utah leaps over her sprawled legs.
Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CAT
EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill
shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges.

Across the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on.

REAGAN looks back.
Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream.
He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door.
Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it.
Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a
patio wall.
Heaves it ahead of him.

The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS.
Utah blasts through a microsecond later.
Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery
crashing everywhere.
He sprints down a hallway after Reagan.
A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they
pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun.

                         WOMAN
          Get the fuck out of this house!
          What the fuck do you think you're
          doing--

Around a corner.  A VICIOUS SNARLING SOUND.
Utah sees something flying at him.  Reflexively catches
it.
Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL.
The Fierce Woman's fierce dog.

UTAH'S POV -- the snarling little demon right in his face.
He drop-kicks it like a goddamn field-goal right through a
doorway and runs on.
Another door.  Another explosion of sunlight.  Another
yard.
Sprinklers this time.  Reagan and Utah running through
sunlit walls of rain.  They crash through another hedge.
Emerging drenched.

The ground drops away.  Slipping and sliding on iceplant,
they skid down a steep slope.  Reagan reaches bottom.
A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to
pavement below.
Reagan falls, landing on his feet.
Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on.

Utah rips down through the iceplant like a human
lawnmower.
Slides over the edge.  Falls -- lands hard.

TIGHT ON HIS KNEE and SLOW MOTION.
Taking the impact.
We HEAR something go.
Utah crashes to the pavement, his face contorted with
pain.
He grabs his tortured knee with both hands.

                         UTAH
          Not now.  Not now!

Reagan runs on.  They are in an enclosed storage yard of
some kind.  Ten foot chainlink all around.
Utah struggles to get up and run.
He sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain.
We see the incredible will driving him on.
He gets up and again, hobbling.  Trying to run.

Reagan reaches the fence.
He is heaving for breath.  Holding his side.
Utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee.
Hobbling forward.  His eyes wild, the veins in his neck
bulging.

Reagan starts to climb.  Utah collapses to his knees.  He
can't go on.
Reagan reaches the top of the fence.  He looks back.

UTAH HAS THE BERETTA POINTED RIGHT AT HIM.
Twenty feet away.  The muzzle rock-steady.  He can't miss.
They both are frozen, panting.  Locked into the moment.

                         REAGAN
          You want me, there's only one way.

PAPPAS reaches the top of the hill, 200 feet away, panting
like he's about to collapse.  He sees the tableau.

ECU -- UTAH'S FINGER on the trigger.  Tightening.
RACK TO his eyes.  Blinking, water running into them.
God, he wants to.

ECU -- REAGAN'S EYES, through the mask.  Locked with
Utah's.

UTAH suddenly snaps his hand up and FIRES VERTICALLY.
HE HOWLS WITH RAGE, FRUSTRATION AND PAIN.
FIRES AGAIN.  And AGAIN.
Slumping back, his shoulders slam down onto the concrete.
Straight-arming the Beretta he FIRES RAPIDLY...
Bulleting the blue sky.

HIGH ANGLE, looking straight down on the tableau.
Reagan leaps off the fence and runs OUT OF FRAME, as Utah
empties the magazine straight at us, the shots merging
with his agonized howl, echoing as we--

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  FBI BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT

UTAH sits next to the DISPATCHER waiting for news like a
sailor in a storm.  His leg is popped up on a chair with
jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around
his knee.
His face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises.
He drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen.

PAPPAS comes through the doors, wiping the remains of
dinner off his mouth.

                         PAPPAS
          Nothing?

                         UTAH
          Nothing.

The Dispatcher talks into his headset, glances up at
Pappas, shakes his head.

                         PAPPAS
          Go home, kid.  Get the hell outta
          here.  Get some sleep.  You look
          like shit.  They get anything even
          resembles your guy, I'm on your
          beeper.  Here.  You like feta?

He smiles warmly, handing his younger partner a brown
paper sack.

                         UTAH
          Feta.  My favorite.

Managing a weary smile.  Lifts his body out of the chair,
turns to go.
Angelo ponders something.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny...

Utah stops.  Looks back at the man.

                         PAPPAS
          All I wanna know is one thing, why
          didn't you just take the shot?

Johnny's gaze turns inward.

                         UTAH
          I don't know.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BATHROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

UTAH sits on the bathroom floor as Tyler dabs Betadyne
antiseptic over his wounds.  Utah cringes.

                         UTAH
          Ouch.

                         TYLER
          Betadyne doesn't hurt.

                         UTAH
          You're kneeling on my hand.

She laughs, shifts her weight and keeps tending him.

                         TYLER
          So what'd the other guy look like?

                         UTAH
          Never saw him, was your basic hit
          and run.

                         TYLER
          But you look like you been in a
          train wreck, how'd he just drive
          away?

Utah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth
won't quite form the words.  Tyler dabs his face, touches
a finger to his forehead.

                         TYLER
          Johnny, what is it with you?  You
          have that look again, it's like
          you're about to tell me something
          and then you don't... or you can't.
          What's going on?

Johnny searches her eyes.
She stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly.

                         TYLER
          What?  What do you want to tell me?

Utah's brow unfurls.  The thought has passed.  He slowly
cups his hand over hers.  Gently pulling her close.

                         UTAH
          I'm glad you pulled me out of the
          water that day...

He presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead.
A kiss to each downcast eye.  Searching out her mouth with
his own as his hands glide down the small of her back.
Their reflection in the mirror as Utah slowly lowers Tyler
to the bathroom floor.  She clings tightly in a breathless
kiss.


EXT.  CLIFF - NIGHT

A Buddha in the moonlight, BODHI sits crosslegged upon the
cliff, staring at the ocean.
CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND HIM, focusing in upon his eyes.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

UTAH asleep, flopped in a spread-eagled X.
WE HEAR the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light
fall across the bed.
Johnny doesn't stir.
A shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him.
An outstretched arm holding a gun.
Utah snores softly, sleeping like a baby.
CAMERA TRACKS IN on his peaceful face.
A single eyelid flutters.  Total silence, until...

KABOOOOMMM!  The Pillow beside him EXPLODES into a
blizzard of goosedown.  Johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth
agape.
TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the
smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand.

                         TYLER
          A lawyer!?  You lied to me!

She throws his FBI gold star at his face.

                         TYLER
          Look, Tyler, I can--

BOOM!  Tyler SQUEEZES off another round.
Cascading goosefeathers falling like snow.
Utah flinches sideways.

                         TYLER
          Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been
          using me!  Your jacket's on the
          floor in the bathroom -- this
          goddamn thing's half out of the
          pocket... Oh God, it's all part of
          some case, isn't it?

                         UTAH
          Tyler, put the gun down.

                         TYLER
          You tell me the fucking truth
          Johnny... did your parents really
          die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!

She waves the Beretta in his face.

                         UTAH
          No.  They live in Columbus Ohio.

Tyler lowers the pistol slowly, the strength leaving her.
Her face begins to flood with tears.

                         UTAH
          I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after
          are surfers.  I needed you, at
          first, but not--

                         TYLER
          Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!!
          Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you
          to hell!

She goes limp as the sobs rack her body.  The gun flops
from her grip.
Utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot.
He moves to gently comfort her.
She bolts at his touch, running from the bedroom.
Utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her.  He
stumbles.

                         UTAH
          Tyler!  Wait!!

From the living room we hear a rattling of keys, the front
door opens and slams shut.  He hobbles to the door,
favoring his knee.  Opens it.  We hear the Porsche
screeching away.
Utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow.

                                            CUT TO:

UTAH on the bed staring up at the ceiling.  Phone cradled,
listening to--

                         TYLER (V.O.)
          Hi, it's me.  Leave a message.

BEEP!  He rests the telephone on his chest, letting the
tape roll a moment before he speaks.

                         UTAH
          Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay.
          I know I fucked up.  I wanted to
          tell you, but I couldn't -- I was
          afraid you'd leave... good guess,
          huh?
                  (grimacing)
          Fuck, why can't I ever say what I
          really mean?  I lied to you.  I'm an
          asshole... but I need you, Tyler.  I
          want you to know that I've never
          known anyone like you before in my
          life... and I... I hope you change
          your mind...

He cradles the receiver, looks out the window.  Black of
night.  Dead still.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

UTAH asleep, telephone still perched on his bare chest.

BUZZZZZZ!  The rasp of the doorbell.
Johnny is airborne, phone flying across the floor.
Hunting for his pants, realizes they are already on, limps
in fast motion to the door.

                         UTAH
          Tyler!  Wait, I--

Whips it open.
BODHI standing in the doorway, smiling like an excited
child.

                         BODHI
          Howdy brah.

NATHANIEL, ROACH, and GROMMET are there behind him.
They look like sentry dogs.  Johnny freezes.
Bodhi walks past Utah, into the room.

                         BODHI
          C'mon, get your gear on, we're
          rollin'.

Cheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance.
He moves through the room, grabbing Johnny's shirt from a
chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor.
Utah sees his FBI shield sitting on the dresser in plain
sight.
He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into
his hip pocket to conceal it.

                         UTAH
          What going on, Bodhi?

Bodhi plucks a couple socks off the couch, hands them to
Utah.

                         BODHI
          Here.
                  (spying Johnny's cut
                   face)
          Hey, what happened?  Ya cut
          yourself shaving?

Johnny meets Bodhi's cold stare.

                         UTAH
          I don't think I wanna surf right
          now.

Bodhi's face takes on a crazy glow.

                         BODHI
          Naw, this is different, Johnny.
          This is something totally
          different... you're gonna love this.

He winds an arm around Johnny's shoulders, guides him
toward the door.

                         BODHI
          C'mon, let's go, let's go.  Time's
          wastin', brah.

Bodhi claps Utah on the back, ushering him outside.
Nathaniel, Roach and Grommet fall into step beside them.
The door closes behind them.
CAMERA DRIFTS back through the apartment, coming to rest
on the 9mm Beretta, on the floor under the bed... useless.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  BODHI'S PICKUP - PREDAWN

The pickup is a funnel of dust along the desert road.
Black mountains against a silver sky.


INT.  BODHI'S PICKUP

The tapedeck blasts.  BODHI and UTAH sit inside the cab.
Through the rear window, we see NATHANIEL, ROACH and
GROMMET in the flatbed.
Bodhi swivels his eyes to Johnny, lowers the volume.

                         BODHI
          Life's sure got a sick sense of
          humor, don't you think so Johnny?

Face splitting into a shit-eating grin.

                         UTAH
          How you figure?

                         BODHI
                  (slight laugh)
          News, last night... those guys, the
          Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank
          yesterday.  And I was just there the
          day before, cashing a check.  See...
          look.  Assured Trust... same place.

He takes a beat up checkbook off the dash and flips it to
Johnny.
Utah opens the cover and looks.
Sure enough.  Assured Trust Savings and Loan.

                         BODHI
          I was picking up some bucks cause
          we're leaving town.  Bizarre, huh?
          If I'd waited a day I'd been right
          in the middle of it.  Kinda sorry I
          missed it.  I'd liked to've seen
          them.

A long pregnant pause.  Utah breathes deeply, remaining
calm, his voice carrying a chilling bravado.

                         UTAH
          Takes guts to rob a bank.  All that
          adrenalin pumping, waving loaded
          guns, taking out the guards, getting
          everybody on the floor, never
          knowin' who's gonna burst in...
                  (looks right at
                   Bodhi)
          ... wondering what it's like to take
          a bullet.  Must be some ride.

Utah's smile is a personal challenge.  Bodhi sits
perversely intrigued.  The mental warfare escalates.

                         BODHI
          Banks are insured, brah.  Long as
          nobody gets shot, it's really a
          victimless crime.  Just gotta scare
          'em a little, would be my guess.
                  (ponders something)
          Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with
          all those guys wearin' body armor
          these days, know what I'd carry?

Bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat.
He pulls out a huge holstered handgun, rests it in his
lap, draws and holds the gun up against his cheek.

                         BODHI
          .454 Casull.  Most powerful handgun
          on the planet.  Muzzle velocity of
          2000 feet per second.  Twice the
          kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum.

Bodhi stares at Utah, then flashes his signature smile.
Utah says coldly.

                         UTAH
          One shot stopping.

                         BODHI
                  (laughs)
          'One shot stopping'... good, very
          good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like
          you because you'll sacrifice
          anything to win.  I respect that.
          It elevates you a little above the
          drones who have learned compromise.
          Here, hold it.  Check out the
          weight.

He twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle
to Utah.
Johnny takes it slowly.  Now it's aimed at Bodhi.

                         BODHI
                  (cheerfully)
          Whoa.  Careful.  You got the muzzle
          pointing right at me, brah.

He casually pushes the barrel away, looking back at the
highway.
Johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a ROUND
into open desert.  KABOOOM!!  The recoil blows Johnny's
arm back over the top of the truck.  Practically breaks
his wrist.
Thunder rolls across the dark hills.
From the back of the pickup Nathaniel howls.
Grommet and Roach high five.

Johnny turns to Bodhi, breaking slowly into a feral grin.

                         UTAH
          Nice.

He hands the smoking weapon back to him.
As if to say "two can play this game".
Bodhi stands challenged.
Each snared in the other's power...
Bodhi takes the weapon back, casually.  Slips it under the
seat.

                         BODHI
          It's a special day, Johnny U.  A
          very special day...

Utah's gaze travels beyond the windshield.
Where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  DESERT AIRSTRIP

TIGHT ON A turbo-prop engine ROARING.

WIDER reveals a big Cessna twin.  The PILOT, a weaselly
guy we haven't seen before, fires up the second engine.
The plane shudders eagerly in the metallic predawn light.
A desert airstrip near Palmdale.  A couple of aluminum-
siding hangers and no tower.  A few other planes around
but no activity besides Bodhi's rock-steady crew.

UTAH watches Grommet whip back a tarp in the bed of
Bodhi's truck and starts tossing out PARACHUTE PACKS.
Roach tosses one to Bodhi, who chucks it to Utah.

                         BODHI
          Ever done this before?

                         UTAH
          Once.

                         BODHI
          Pure adrenalin, right?!  The
          ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for
          it, jab a vein for it -- all you
          gotta do is jump.

                         UTAH
          Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I
          sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--

                         BODHI
          Yeah, I noticed you limping.
                  (grins)
          But don't worry about it, brah.
          Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna
          land on land!

Bodhi grabs his sleeve, ushering him into the plane.

                         UTAH
          Oh, well, that's fine then.  I feel
          so much better.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CESSNA

Utah sits, wearing a day-glo jump suit, hugging the chute
in his lap.  Next to him is the gaping door.  Beyond... a
spectacular down sunburst at 10,000 feet.  ROAR of wind
and engines.

Utah watches Bodhi, Nathaniel, Grommet and Roach wriggling
into their colorful freefall suits.  Nathaniel pulls on a
pair of purple shorts over his suit.  Looks real dorky.
Grommet has on duck feet.  Bodhi, apparently, is going to
jump barefoot.
Nobody has their chutes on yet.
Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the
contents.  His brain is racing.  Bodhi shouts over the
roar.

                         BODHI
          It's a little ceremony we always
          have at the end of summer.  One last
          speedstar.

                         UTAH
          So, who... uh, who packed my chute?

                         BODHI
          I did.  What's the matter?  Don't
          trust me?

                         UTAH
          You gotta earn trust.

                         BODHI
          Then we'll earn it together.  Here,
          take mine.

Bodhi swaps chutes with Johnny.
Utah looks at the new chute uncertainly.
Is this a game?  Poker moves?
Did Bodhi anticipate this step?

                         ROACH
          Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man.
          His pack-jobs suck... they only open
          half the time.  Take Grommet's, man.

Roach's grin is evil as he grabs Grommet's chute out of
his hands and switches it with Johnny's.  Keeps that one
and gives his to Grommet.

                         GROMMET
          Whoa, unfair, dude!

Grommet grabs his chute back and hands Johnny the one he
had, which was Roach's.  I think.
Johnny looks at the pack in his hands.  Then at the
grinning faces.
Russian surfer freefall roulette.  Shit.
Bodhi studying him.  Some kind of test.
Fuck it.  Utah starts putting the damn thing on.

                         UTAH
          We gonna jump or jerk off?

                         BODHI
          My man!


EXT.  10,000 FEET - DAWN

Multi-colored figures explode from the plane.  Leaping
into freefall.  Tumbling end over end.
WEARING HEADSETS, they hurtle downward.

                         BODHI (RADIO)
          Utah, you copy bruddah?

                         UTAH (RADIO)
          Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!

                         BODHI
          I'll take that as a yes.

One by one they stabilize.  Falling face down, knees bent,
they angle their hands and feet minutely to move
laterally.  Utah flails, the last to trim out.  But he's
holding his own.

Grommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild
spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive.  He
flares out and "flies" back to the others.
Rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to
paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on
a separate plane of existence.
A hurricane of wind.  Wild HOOTING.
Despite his terror, Johnny has to grin at Nathaniel,
falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube
in the pool.

                         ROACH
          Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with
          the cosmos!

                         BODHI
          Ten thousand feet.  Let's do it.

The group stabilizes, moving together.
First Bodhi and Roach link arms, trimming constantly.
Concentrating.  Nathaniel flips over onto his stomach and
maneuvers toward them.  He grabs Roach's arm.
Grommet works his way next to Nathaniel.  Locks in.
They need Utah to complete the ring.
Four faces beckoning to him, distorted by the hurricane
wind.

                         BODHI
          Come on Johnny.  Get in here!

Johnny moves his hands like flippers and glides clumsily
toward them.  Bodhi and Grommet grab him.  He's in.
A perfect five-man star.

                         BODHI
          Relax, brah.  I got you, I got you.

                         GROMMET
          Righteous-ass speedstar, dudes!

                         BODHI
          You diggin' this?

                         UTAH
          Great!  GREAT!

Johnny is exhilarated more than he could have thought.
Screaming down through the dawn sky at 130.
Locked into the ring.  Part of something.
Connected to these guys far above the planet.
Less far every second... Bodhi's chest altimeter reads
6,000 feet.

                         BODHI
          Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles,
          folks.  See ya downtown!

He releases Roach's arm and the star disintegrates,
drifting apart.
Bodhi stays with Utah, falling parallel to the horizon,
facing each other, holding hands.  4000 feet.  Airspeed
140.

Grommet pulls his ripcord.  He seems to be jerked upward
by a great force.  Suddenly he is far above, a brightly
colored disc of fabric.
Utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him.
Nathaniel pulls, then Roach.  They shoot upward,
disappearing.
Bodhi and Utah fall on, alone.

                         BODHI
          You gonna pull?

                         UTAH
          After you, Alfonse.  I insist!

Bodhi looks at Utah.  A slow grin.  The meter on his chest
harness reads 2000 ft.  150 mph.  12 seconds to Valhalla.

                         BODHI
          Don't screw around man, pull it!

                         UTAH
          You do it... you first!

                         BODHI
          One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn
          cord!

                         UTAH
          You first!

                         BODHI
          Okay!

Bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls Utah's ripcord
handle.
He waves goodbye as Johnny's canopy deploys.  Utah is
jerked upward.  He feels his weight hanging brutally in
the harness.
Johnny looks down.
Impossibly close to the ground.  Bodhi's canopy BURSTS
OUT, an explosion of color.  Below him is the shimmering
mirror of a LARGE RESERVOIR.  Two seconds later the bright
yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack.  An
explosion of white water marks Bodhi's impact.

LOW ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL as Utah hits.
IN SLOW MOTION a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts
skyward.
Molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn.
Utah surfaces, sputtering, and shucks out of the harness.
He floats like a jellyfish, gasping for breath.

                         UTAH
          Jesus Christ.  I gotta be losin' it.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  AIRFIELD - DAY

Bodhi walks toward us, dripping wet and grinning.
He wraps his arm around Utah's shoulders as the others
walk up.
They're all soaked and stoked.

                         BODHI
          Ya see... I told you Johnny U was
          gonna be just fine!

Roach and the others clap him on the back.  A moment of
acceptance into the tribe.  Utah isn't sure what it means
yet.

                         BODHI
          C'mere.  There's something you need
          to see.

Bodhi leads him toward a PLAIN UTILITY VAN parked nearby.
It was there earlier but Utah had no reason to notice it.
Bodhi opens the rear doors and motions Johnny inside.
Utah, puzzled and suddenly alert, steps in.  Bodhi
follows.


INT.  VAN - DAY

The interior is empty except for several canvas duffel
bags and a small portable VCR.  It is one of the new sales
presentation models, with deck and monitor together in one
tiny unit.

                         UTAH
          What's this?

                         BODHI
          Insurance policy.  Now this is going
          to sting a bit, but it's for your
          own growth, brah.  Press play.

Utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny
screen.

TIGHT ON SCREEN.  A night shot.  Rosie the biker has Tyler
in a powerful grip.  Her hands are cuffed behind her, and
her mouth is taped.  He has his switchblade up to her
throat.  Her eyes are wild, but with rage, not fear.
She's trying to struggle out of his grip, kicking at him
viciously.
He controls her efficiently.
Bodhi stops the tape.

                         BODHI
          She's a wild one, isn't she...
          Special Agent Utah?

Utah lunges, pinning Bodhi to the wall of the van... an
elbow across his throat.

                         UTAH
          You're a fucking dead man--

                         BODHI
                  (gasping for breath)
          Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm
          the only one knows where they are.
          Just let me talk for a second.

Johnny pulls back.  Barely in control.

                         UTAH
          Talk.

                         BODHI
          She'll be fine, Rosie won't do
          anything.  At least not as long as I
          meet him at a certain place and time,
          about... let's see...
                  (he looks at his
                   dive Rolex)
          ... six hours from now.

Utah's voice sounds kind of strangled.

                         UTAH
          You call him... right now... and
          tell him to let her go.

                         BODHI
          Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on
          the road.  And where they're going
          there's no phones.  Damn, I hate
          this Johnny, I really do.  I hate
          violence.  See, that's why I need
          Rosie.  I could never make this
          thing work, myself.  No way I could
          hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man!
          She was my woman, once.  We shared
          time in this world.  But Rosie, he's
          kind of a... mechanism.  Once you
          set him in motion, he won't stop.
          That's his gift, a kind of...
          blankness.  Noon comes, straight up,
          he'll gut her like a pig and try not
          to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I
          can do, unless I get there.

Utah blanches as he takes this in.  Knows Bodhi well
enough now to know he means business.

                         BODHI
          So that makes us partners, doesn't
          it?  Because now we both have the
          same goal... to get me where I need
          to go.  Right?

Utah's expression turns suddenly cold as an executioner's.

                         UTAH
          We're wasting time.

                         BODHI
          See!  That's what I like about you,
          man!  You're just sharp as a razor
          blade.

Bodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others,
gathered nearby.  He addresses the pilot first...

                         BODHI
          Get the plane down to Santa Monica
          and top up the tanks.
                  (to the others)
          Let's go.  Let's saddle up!

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  L.A. STREETS - DAY

A STYLIZED LONG LENS SHOT stacks the cars into a dreamlike
mirage.  The van weaves slowly among them with predatory
stealth.

                         BODHI (V.O.)
          Okay.  All I'm askin' for is ninety
          seconds of your life, Johnny.
          That's all.


INT.  VAN

EXTREME CLOSEUP ON the velcro straps of Second Chance
armor.  Tanned fingers cinch it tight.  A SHELL slides
into the cylinder of the Casull.  A SHOTGUN is cocked.
KACHACK!

                         BODHI
          It's basic dog psychology, brah.  If
          you scare them, get them pissing
          down their leg, they submit... you
          control them.  If you project
          weakness, you draw aggression...
          that's how people get hurt.

WIDER, revealing that Bodhi is in the back with Utah and
Roach.
Nathaniel and Grommet sit up front.
The duffels contents are strewn around.  Masks.  Weapons.
They're all pulling on suit pants and jackets.  Tying
ties.  Slipping on white gloves.  Snappy Oxfords.
Bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his BODY ARMOR.
Utah is fumbling with his armored vest.  He works with
vicious, jerky moves.  His jaw locked.  Eyes down.

                         BODHI
          Fear causes hesitation, and
          hesitation will cause your worst
          fears to come true.  You project
          strength to avoid conflict.

                         ROACH
          Peace through superior firepower,
          babe.

Bodhi conspicuously empties all the shells from a PUMP 12
GAUGE.
Pockets the shells.  Tosses the weapon to Utah.

                         BODHI
          Here, you need this.  You can't be
          comin' through that door with your
          dick in your hands, right?

                         UTAH
          I can't do this.

                         BODHI
          Sure you can!  You may even like
          it... it's a killer rush.  You'll
          see.  Hey, don't I show you things,
          Johnny U?

                         UTAH
          Bodhi, this is your wake up call,
          man -- I... am... an... Eff...
          Bee... Eye... Agent!!

                         BODHI
          Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a
          higher plane, you and I.  We make
          our own rules.  Why be a servant of
          the law Johnny U... when you can be
          it's master?

                         GROMMET
          Fuckin' A!

                         BODHI
          Ninety seconds, man, door to door.
          A small price to pay for someone who
          loves you.
                  (he looks up)
          She does you know.  It's not her
          style to fall so hard... I don't
          think she did with me.

He pulls the Ronald Reagan mask over his head smoothly.
Roach pulls his on.  NIXON.  Nathaniel becomes KENNEDY.
Grommet transforms into LBJ.
Bodhi looks in the bag -- no more masks.

                         BODHI
          Sorry, Johnny.  Guess you don't get
          to be president.

JOHNNY'S POV -- the back doors of the van.  And the
promise of what is beyond.  Bodhi enters FRAME.  Looks
straight at us.

                         BODHI
          Rock and roll!

BOOM -- THE DOORS bang open, REVEALING--


EXT.  STREET - BANK - DAY

STILL IN POV (HANDHELD) we hurl ourselves from the dark
van into blasting daylight.  Bodhi is ahead of us in the
sprint for the bank doors.  Dizzying forward momentum as
we hammer through the doors into--


INT.  BANK

THE HANDHELD POV CONTINUES as we follow Bodhi, a wolf
plunging among the sheep.  A FAT GUARD inside the doors.
He turns to us just as Bodhi butt-strokes him hard in the
gut.
Someone screams.

                         BODHI
          Everybody freeze!!  Don't move!!

AHEAD of us GROMMET/LBJ covers the SECOND GUARD with his
12 gauge.

                         GROMMET
          Don't fucking do it, man!

The guy has his hand on the grip of his pistol but it's
like the thing suddenly weighs eight tons, he can't seem
to lift it from the holster.  ROACH/NIXON slips up next to
him and helps him with it.  The guy is visibly trembling.

A YOUNG JOCK makes a move to run.
'OUR' SHOTGUN comes up like a reflex, right in his face.
Roach/Nixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair.
AHEAD OF US, Bodhi is in action.  Moving to the counter,
shouting--

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          All Tellers back away from the
          counter!  Hands on your heads!
          RIGHT NOW!!  That's right.  You know
          the drill.

It's like a replay of the robbery Utah saw on video.  But
he's right in the middle of it, like in some kind of
nightmare.

WE'RE STILL IN POV, the image WHIPPING wildly from side to
side as Utah scans the room.  We whirl dervish among the
statuary of the customers and bank employees.  Our gaze
drifts across THE FLOOR MANAGER, a short guy in a brown
suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          All customers on the floor.  Let's
          go!  Move it!  Get down!  On the
          floor!  Right now!  Let's go.

Roach and Grommet are pushing them down.
Utah stands stiffly with the shotgun.  He seems dazed.
He catches the eye of a CUSTOMER.  In a tenth of a second
we see Johnny see the customer see his uncertainty.  Fear
has them both hyper-aware.
Johnny gestures fiercely with the shotgun.

                         UTAH
          On the floor, asshole!  What's your
          problem?!  I blow your fucking
          kneecaps out, you'll be on the
          floor!!

The guy hits the deck like a sack of cement.
BODHI/REAGAN floats beside Johnny, scanning with the
Casull.  He speaks without turning his head.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          Kick in the ass, ain't it?  Gonna be
          kinda hard to explain though... when
          they play the tapes back down at the
          bureau.  Could look bad on your
          monthly evaluation.

Johnny looks up at surveillance camera.  He's quite
fucked.

                         UTAH
          Can we just get the goddamn money
          and get out of here?!

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          That's the spirit!!
                  (to the room)
          Head's down!  Eyes down!  Just a
          couple minutes of your life and
          we're gone.

Bodhi leaps to the counter, commanding the room.
But at this point they diverge from their time-proven
plan.
Roach isn't going for the drawers... he's sprinting for
the VAULT.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          You!
                  (reading a name-tag)
          Miss Jennings... of New Accounts.
          Be a dear and open the inner gate
          for my associate.  NOW!!

                         MISS JENNINGS
          He -- he -- he has the keys.  Mr.
          Duggan.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          Whatta say, Mr. Duggan?  Wanna give
          her the keys or do I pick through
          the blood and chunks for them?

DUGGAN, the bank manager, is surprisingly calm as he takes
the keys from his pocket.  Holds them out to the terrified
woman.

                         DUGGAN
          Do whatever they say, Terry.

MISS JENNINGS hurries to comply.
She unlocks the STEEL CAGE inside the big vault door.
Roach/Nixon and Grommet/LBJ take her inside with them.

A CUSTOMER, lying on the floor near the fat guard catches
his eye.
The guard, face jammed against the linoleum, blanches as
he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal
THE BUTT OF A PISTOL.  The customer mouths the words "I'm
a cop".
The guard is hyperventilating.

AT THE FRONT DOORS A WOMAN comes in out of the bright
sunlight.
JFK pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor.  Then
goes back to watching the street.

JOHNNY is next to Bodhi/Reagan.

                         UTAH
          You're blowing it, man!  You're
          breaking your own rules... pulling
          too much time!

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          JFK, how we doin'?

                         NATHANIEL/JFK
          All clear, man!

INSIDE THE VAULT Grommet and Roach are pillaging rapidly.
Their hands blur as nice fat STACKS OF 20s and 100s are
dumped into canvas sacks.

ON THE MAIN FLOOR the OFF DUTY COP slips his hands slowly
around the butt of his pistol, concealing the move with
his body.
He signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the
guard's ankle.

TIGHT ON THE GUARD'S ANKLE where we can see a sliver of
BACK-UP GUN, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster.
The guard's eyes are pleading with the hard-on cop.
"Don't make me do this".
The guy is sweating, shaking.  A yellow liquid spreads
across the tiles next to his quivering hips.  He's
actually pissing himself, he's so scared.

TIGHT ON the off-duty cop.  Watching like a ferret.  He
cocks his .38.
ECU GUARD'S EYES, wide with terror.

It happens like lightning.  The cop pops to his knees,
straight-arming the .38.  The guard goes for his ankle
holster.
REAGAN spins.
The cop FIRES.  BLAM!
Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the
impact.
He crashes onto a desk on his back.  Slides off,
scattering papers.
A teller screams.  The cop spins toward Utah.
Johnny throws down the shotgun.  Shows his palms.  He's
holding out his gold star.

                         UTAH
          Federal agent!  Undercover!

The cop FIRES TWICE.  Two in the chest.  Utah is hurled
back.  Slams into the tellers' counter.

NATHANIEL/LBJ lets go with the 12 gauge.  BOOM!
The cop spins, hit by some 00 buck pellets.
The guard caps-off like a maniac.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
BLAM!!!
All of them wild, but serving to get Nathaniel pinned down
behind a check-writing island.

ROACH/NIXON LEAPS THE COUNTER and lands behind the guard.
The guard's shoulder explodes as Roach's 12 gauge
detonates.  He pitches onto his face, screaming and
holding the wreckage of his upper arm.
Grommet/LBJ is coming over the counter behind Roach as the
off-duty cop spins and fires.  BLAM!  BLAM!  Roach takes
it in the chest.  Staggers back, firing into the floor.
Trips and drops his shotgun.
Grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his
fingers.

IN SLOW MOTION Reagan's face rises above the counter.
The mask is askew.  In order to see, Bodhi pulls it off.
The Casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as--

THE COP turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around,
nightmarishly slow as--

BODHI COCKS THE CASULL in dream-time and--
KABOOOOM!!!  The world's most powerful handgun proves its
claim at 2000 feet per second.

A gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest.
He is lifted off his feet.  Hits and slides across the
floor leaving a two-foot wide red smear.
Echoes slap the walls.  Then all is still.  Plaintive
whimpering and moaning.  The air is blue with smoke.

Johnny is trying to catch his breath.  He rips his shirt
open to see two deep indentations in the Second Chance
vest.  Flattened .38 slugs caught in the Kevlar mesh.  But
no blood.

Bodhi drops over the counter near Utah.
The two men look at each other.
Bodhi's eyes seem lost.  He stares around at the carnage
he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game.
His expression changes to something new -- truly crazed
now.  We feel that the madness which has been held in
check so long has been let off its leash.

                         BODHI
          Don't anybody fucking move!

Roach, clutching his side, moves to Grommet, who is on his
knees.
Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows
down Grommet's chest.  Roach pulls off the mask.
Revealing a terrified kid.
Grommet pulls his blood-drenched hand away from his
throat, stares at it bug-eyed.

                         GROMMET
          Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all
          comin' out man, gotta stop it...
          it's all gonna come out... do
          something!!

He's trying to hold it in with his hands.  This doesn't
work.
A paste-white frightened kid.  Eighteen years old.
Suddenly realizing that this is not some video game.  That
death is real.
He slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness.
WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING.

                         ROACH
                  (freaking to Bodhi)
          We gotta bug out, man!  We're eatin'
          it bad on this one.  Let's go!

Bodhi reaches down and picks up Johnny's FBI shield off
the floor.
He considers it for a long time.  Then looks up at Johnny.
His eyes seem to ask for forgiveness...
A moment before he smashes the Casull into Johnny's skull.

JOHNNY'S POV, as he drops to his knees.  Everything going
dark as we see Bodhi's face distantly, his mouth moving
slowly...

                         BODHI
          Goodbye, Johnny.

The floor rushes up and smashes us in the face.
A view of shoes, running away from us, leaving bloody
footprints.  Then total darkness.

                                            CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  FIRST SECURITY BANK - LATER

Ten minutes later the bank "crime scene" is in full swing.
UNIFORM COPS are everywhere, trying to get statements from
sobbing witnesses.  HARP, MUNOZ, COLE AND PAPPAS represent
the FBI contingent.  Cole has one arm strapped to his body
in a fairly elaborate sling, and he moves slowly.

Harp is barking orders to everyone in sight.  Outside
(visible beyond the doors) it's total pandemonium, with
cops and ambulances, and of course a huge crowd of
rubberneckers.  A MINICAM CREW shows up.  Harp starts
shouting at them.

COLE, with evident pleasure, cinches down a pair of
handcuff's on Utah's wrists with his good hand.  Johnny
has a deep cut on his forehead, and the blood is trickling
into his eyes, but he seems not to notice.  Not to hear
MUNOZ speaking monotonously--

                         MUNOZ
          -- if you so desire, an attorney
          will be provided for you free of
          cost.  Do you understand these
          rights I have explained to you?
          Utah?

Pappas charges through the crowd, pushing Munoz aside.

                         PAPPAS
          He knows his goddamn rights!
                  (looks at Utah)
          Jesus, kid.  I knew you were getting
          too close to these guys.
                  (turns to the other
                   agents)
          Gimme the goddamn key to these
          things, Cole.  Christ!

He gestures to the cuffs still cutting into Johnny's
wrists.
Cole hands him the key.
Harp storms toward them.

                         HARP
          Don't take those off.  Just leave
          them on!  Your partner's an
          accessory to murder.  You realize
          that?

Harp spins Johnny by the shoulder to look at--
Paramedics carrying the covered body of the off-duty cop.
Beyond, still on the floor, is Grommet, his eyes staring
in death.
He was right about not making thirty.

                         HARP
          Three men dead.  One of them a cop.
          How's that sit in your gut, Utah?

                         UTAH
                  (cold and scary)
          Take your hand off my shoulder right
          now.

Harp pulls back instinctively.  Utah's eyes burn into him.
Looks like Johnny's not in the FBI anymore.

                         PAPPAS
          Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to
          the uniforms like some punk.  Let me
          ride him in.

                         HARP
          Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two
          screw-ups deserve each other.
          That's why I put you together in the
          first place.  Christ Pappas, you're
          as bad as he is... talk about the
          blind leading the blind--

Pappas steps close to the Supervising Agent.

                         PAPPAS
          Harp, let me tell you something.  I
          was an agent in this bureau when
          your mommy was still wiping your
          shinny pink ass, and you know one
          thing I learned in all those years
          that you still haven't?

                         HARP
          What that?

Angelo steps in with a roundhouse that has all of his 280
pounds behind it.
Harp's head snaps back, and he flops in a heap.

                         PAPPAS
          Respect your elders.
                  (he takes Utah by
                   the arm)
          Let's go kid.

Harp struggles to sit up, rubbing his jaw, as Pappas
stuffs Utah into his car.  Harp is so shocked he doesn't
say a word.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  PAPPAS' CAR

They drive for a couple of blocks in silence, side by
side.
Utah in disgrace.  Contrite.  Stony.  Finally...

                         UTAH
          I know where they're going.

                         PAPPAS
          Figured you did.

Angelo flips Johnny the key.
Johnny lets himself out of the cuffs.  He sits rubbing his
wrists.

                         UTAH
          Only problem is... we can't arrest
          them or shoot them.

ON PAPPAS' "what the fuck?!" expression we--

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  SANTA MONICA AIRPORT

LONG LENS SHOT through a forest of small planes as Pappas'
sedan glides INTO FRAME.  It moves sharklike among through
the Cessna forest.  Slows to a stop.
Through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see Pappas
get out of the car and start working his way among the
aircraft.
Utah slides behind the wheel and drives on.

TIGHT ON TURBOPROP ENGINE roaring as it warms up.
The same aircraft as before.
Bodhi and Nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open
back door as the pilot completes his pre-flight checks.
The Ex-President's suits have been removed, along with the
body armor, and no guns are in sight.  Just a couple of
guys getting ready for a charter flight.  Bodhi looks up
and stops his work as...

THE FBI SEDAN stops about 50 feet away.
Nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels.
Utah gets out.  He holds his hands out from his body and
turns completely around.  Without his jacket on, it is
evident that he is not carrying a gun.
He walks forward.

                         UTAH
          I'm not armed.

                         BODHI
          But you're not alone.

                         UTAH
          Good guess.  There's a gun on you
          right now.

Bodhi feigns casual interest.  Looks around.  He can't
see...

PAPPAS nearby.  Moving cat-like behind a row of service
vehicles.  He gets his snubnose .38 propped on the bumper
of one, with a clear shot at Bodhi and Nathaniel.

                         UTAH
          Where's Roach?

                         BODHI
          Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in
          kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can
          I do for you?

                         UTAH
          You gotta tell me where she is.

                         BODHI
          And let my policy expire?  Sorry.

                         UTAH
          Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead.
          The ride is over.

                         BODHI
          I say when it's over!

                         UTAH
          The guy you killed was an off duty
          cop!  If you get out of here they'll
          nail you wherever you land.  They
          have a new thing called radar.
          Maybe you've heard of it.

Though he can't hear what's going on.  THE PILOT has
clocked the tension between the two men.  And the shotgun
in Nathaniel's hands.  He blanches, and starts to shut
down the plane's power.
By his reaction we see that he's obviously not in on it.

ROACH comes out of the hangar building nearby.  Neither
Utah nor Pappas see him.  But he sees Pappas drawn down on
Bodhi.  He drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel
he was carrying.

TIGHT ON DUFFEL BAG, as it opens.  The pistol grip of a 12
gauge riot-gun sticks out of lots and lots of money.
Roach's hand slides the gun out slowly.

UTAH IS VERY CLOSE to Bodhi.

                         UTAH
          I know you man, when they fall on
          you, you won't back down.  They'll
          have to burn your ass to the ground.
          And I can't stop them... I'm the
          last person they're ready to listen
          to right now.  Thanks to you.

                         UTAH
          Shit may or may not happen.

                         UTAH
          Look, you got a death wish, you want
          to ride to glory... fine!  But don't
          take her with you, man.  I'm begging
          you... tell me where she is.  Then I
          walk away.  We've earned that much
          trust, haven't we?

The pilot opens the door and is climbing out when
Nathaniel wheels on him.  The pilot goes cross-eyed
staring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge, inches from his
face.

                         BODHI
                  (to the pilot)
          Back in the hotseat, campadre.
          NOW!

BEHIND THE TRUCKS, Pappas senses something.
His head snaps around.
Roach is behind him with the 12 gauge.  He FIRES.
Pappas hurls his weight sideways, as the buckshot punches
into the truck fender.  Some of it catches Pappas in the
hip.  He hits the ground hard and whips up the .38 BAM!
BAM!  BAM!
Roach flips onto his back.
The shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck.
Pappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the
others.

NATHANIEL fires once, wild.  Terrified.  His shot blows a
divot out of the asphalt next to Pappas.
He pumps the slide, chambering another round.
Then Pappas' fourth and fifth rounds drill into him.
He slams back against the Cessna's fuselage.
Slides down.  Two red smears on the white aircraft.
Bodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge.
Pappas takes aim.  One round left.
Utah sprints between them.

                         UTAH
          Angelo!  Don't fire!

                         PAPPAS
          Kid, get outta the way!!

                         UTAH
          NOOO!!

Utah is blocking Bodhi with his body.
Bodhi's fingers are poised, frozen, a few inches from the
shotgun.
Standoff.

                         PAPPAS
          GODDAMMIT!!

He snaps the pistol up, aimed at the sky.
Pappas stands panting.  Enraged and frustrated.  Pain
searing his leg.  Everything is tense and electrified.
BOOM!!  Pappas' chest EXPLODES with a spray of blood!

BEHIND HIM, ROACH is lying on one elbow in a pool of
scarlet.
He cocks another round into the chamber and fires again.
BOOM!

Angelo drops to his knees, holding his ruined body like
he's hugging himself.  Johnny lunges toward him, his face
distorted with shock.

                         UTAH
          NNNOOOOOO!!!

Angelo's eyes meet his for a moment.
In his dilated pupils is the great question.
Then he slumps forward and lies very still.
The breath leaves his body and doesn't go back in.

Johnny moves toward his friend in a daze.  Drops to one
knee beside him.
Roach aims the shotgun at him, coughing blood.
Utah doesn't notice.  Or is beyond caring.
Bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction.
Roach's finger relaxes on the trigger.

Utah puts his hand on Angelo's white crewcut hair.
He hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as
Bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge.

Roach is working himself to his knees.  His breath is
sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the
customary breathing orifices.  Bodhi crosses to him and
helps him up.  He covers Utah with the shot gun as he
half-carries Roach to the plane.  The pilot is white with
shock.  He'd run if he could remember how.

                         PILOT
          I ain't flyin' you guys to San
          Phillipe man, forget it.  Not now--

                         BODHI
          Thanks for telling the nice FBI
          agent where we're going.

Roach works his way up into the plane.  He waves the
shotgun at the pilot, his face a vicious, blood-flecked
mask.

                         ROACH
          Get in the fucking plane.

Bodhi stands behind Johnny, the shotgun aimed at his head.
Their expressions are lethally cold.
We see that Utah hates this man who was his friend, his
teacher, more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate.

                         BODHI
          We're gonna ride this out, all the
          way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go.

Johnny nods slowly, as if accepting that this was all
somehow pre-ordained, and that they both knew the game
would take them this far and beyond.  He stands and walks
to the plane.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MEXICO - DAY

THE SCREEN EXPLODES WITH A BLUR OF MOTION.
POV of the ground racing below us at 180 mph.

REVERSE, preceding the plane as it rockets through barren
canyons.
As close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it.
Under the radar.


INT.  PLANE

The aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and
banks wildly.
Bodhi has the Casull aimed at the base of his skull from
the jump seat just behind him.
Roach holds the shotgun on Utah, seated across from him in
the rear seats.
Roach is a pale, sweaty mask.  He is propped against a
bulkhead, seemingly collapsed in on himself like a
discarded coat.
His entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood.
But his gaze is steady, and the shotgun is aimed into
Utah's guts.
No one talks or moves on this grim hell-ride.


EXT.  ARROYO

Near noon.  The sun blisters a landscape out of time.
The white Cessna rockets above the saguaros, its shadow
pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some
manic alter ego below it.  It WOOSHES over us, raising
dust devils.


INT.  PLANE

The pilot yells over his shoulder to Bodhi...

                         PILOT
          Look, we been in Mexico the last
          half hour... can I quit mowing the
          lawn here or what?  I'm getting more
          brush in the wheels than I usually
          like, you know what I'm saying?!

                         BODHI
          Yeah, get some height.  Take her up
          to eight thousand on this heading.

The pilot pulls back on the yoke and the plane climbs.
Bodhi moves back next to Roach, who's fading.

                         ROACH
          We're gonna pop up on their screens.

                         BODHI
          Doesn't matter now.  We're almost
          there, man.  Here, let me help you
          get your gear on.

Bodhi drags a parachute pack up onto the seat next to
Roach and starts helping him into the harness.  Roach
keeps the shot gun pointed at Johnny.

                         ROACH
          I'm cold.

                         BODHI
          You're gonna be fine.  Just fine.
          Johnny, toss me that money bag will
          you.  Easy does it.

Utah hefts the duffel.  Weighs its contents, and their
price.

                         UTAH
          You're cold because all the blood is
          running out of your body, Roach.
          You're going to be dead soon.
                  (he tosses the bag)
          I hope it was worth it.

Roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a Teddy
bear.  Glares at Utah.  He hooks the strap of the duffel
over one shoulder.

                         BODHI
          Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych
          you man, forget it.  Just keep
          thinking about all those senoritas
          nursin' you back to health.  Come
          on, amigo, let's get you set for the
          jump.

Bodhi props Roach next to the open door and takes a
walkie-talkie from the seat, keying it.

                         BODHI
          Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One,
          do you copy, over?

A burst of static is followed by a surprisingly clear
voice.

                         ROSIE (V.O.)
          Copy you, Air Force One.  We have a
          visual on you.  Lookin' fine.

                         UTAH
          Tell him to release Tyler.

                         BODHI
          Why should I?

                         UTAH
          What if your chute fails, Bodhi?
          Rescind the order.  Let her off the
          hook, she's served her purpose.  Do
          it, man, you owe me that much.  Let
          me hear it before you check out.

Bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of
seconds, then keys the walkie.

                         BODHI
          Rosie, listen carefully.  Surgery
          is canceled, is that clear?  Repeat
          it back to me.

                         ROSIE (V.O.)
          Copy you.  Surgery is canceled.
          I'm lettin' the bitch go.

Bodhi looks out the doorway.  Gauging distance, airspeed,
the geography below.  He looks at Utah, aiming the Casull
at him.
Johnny stares back at him like a pit viper.

                         BODHI
          I know it's hard for you Johnny.
          You want me so bad it's like acid in
          your mouth.  But not his time.
                  (he braces Roach at
                   the door)
          Let's go.

Bodhi signals the pilot and Utah feels the plane drop as
the engines are cut back to an idle.  Bodhi slaps Roach on
the shoulder and Roach slumps backward out of the plane.
Bodhi braces to jump, looking at Johnny for a last split-
second.

                         BODHI
          You lose, campadre.

He chucks the Casull onto the seat beside the door and
bails.
Bodhi tumbles out into space.  It's over.

Utah's knuckles are white, gripping the seat.  There's a
dynamo, spinning out of control in his head.  He leaps up
in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a
bulkhead.  Looks around like a rabid animal.  TWO SECONDS.
THREE SECONDS.  Then...

                         UTAH
          FUCK IT!!!

Utah grabs the Casull off the seat and dives out of the
plane.


EXT.  PLANE

UTAH, WITHOUT A PARACHUTE, but carrying a very large gun,
rockets downward.  He presses his arms to his sides and
falls head-down, building speed.

Three hundred feet below him is Bodhi, freefalling in a
spread-eagle position.  Utah moves his feet and hands,
angling toward him.
Bodhi doesn't see him.  Falling flat, he tops out at
terminal velocity for that position.  130 mph.

Utah slashes downward at 160 mph.  The gap between them
closes.
Utah is almost blinded by the windstream.  His eyes burn.
His lips are peeled back by the blasting air.
Bodhi is eighty feet below him... 4000 feet to terra
firma.
Utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration.
He's only going to have one shot at this.
Bodhi is right below him.
Utah is closing like a SAM missile.
He trims a little, and...
WHAM!  Slams into Bodhi in a mid-air tackle.

Bodhi's eyes are wide with amazement as they tumble
together.
Utah has made the grab and locked his arms around Bodhi in
an iron grip.
He pulls the Casull's muzzle up to Bodhi's head and
screams in his face.

                         UTAH
          Pull the parachute!!

Bodhi looks at the gun.  Looks at Utah.  Grins wildly.

                         BODHI
          Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for
          you.  Why don't you pull it?

                         UTAH
          No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord!
          Now!!

                         BODHI
          Naw, you pull it!

Utah looks down.  The earth is rushing at them.  2500
feet.

                         BODHI
          Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you
          gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?!
          You use your other hand what you
          gonna hold on with?

                         UTAH
          Pull it right now or I'll blow your
          fucking head off and pull it myself!

                         BODHI
          Well that's the only way it's gonna
          happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you
          want to do it.  You're gonna die,
          Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...

1000 feet.  The ground is close enough to see details.
Cactus, sagebrush.  They rocket past the bright yellow
canopy of Roach's chute a hundred feet away.

                         UTAH
          You fucking crazy!?  Pull it!!

They're right in each other's faces.  Taking it way beyond
the edge.
Bodhi's eyes are wild.  A gleeful, adrenalized madness...
his pupils are the entrance to Hell.

                         BODHI
          Three seconds... two... one...

                         UTAH
          SHIT!!

Utah flings the Casull away and pulls the rip-cord so hard
he almost loses his grip anyway.  POOM!  The canopy cracks
out.
Full and round and bright red.
The ground roars at us.
WHAP!  Utah and Bodhi hit.  Hard.

They slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a
cloud of dust.
Rocks and debris clatter into silence.

NEARBY Roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll.
He moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his
eyes stare without blinking right at the sun.  Next to him
the money satchel's contents are spilled right into the
sand.  Roach's lifeless hands lie limp among the bills
that caper in the desert wind.

UTAH AND BODHI are both completely still as the dust
clears.  Finally they groan and stir.  Necks move, hands
move, legs move.  Bodhi rolls to his knees.  He is cut and
scraped, the blood running bright down his dust-covered
skin.

Utah looks around, blinking.
Surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red-hot
Mexican desert.
Bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him.

                         BODHI
          Wild ride, huh?

                         UTAH
                  (gasping)
          Jesus Christ, Bodhi!

Utah tries to rise and -- grabs his knee in agony.  We see
by his mask of pain that it's totaled inside.

                         BODHI
          That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad.

He looks up at the sound of an engine.

BODHI'S POV of his big four-by roaring toward us with a
meteor tail of dust.  It slides to a stop next to them.
Rosie gets out of the driver's side and stands calmly with
a sawed-off over his shoulder.

Utah blinks through his sweat and pain at--

TYLER running toward him out of the dust.  She kneels next
to him and puts her arms around him.  Bodhi limps to the
truck.  Through the swirling dust we see him look back.

                         BODHI
          You had me worried there, for a
          second, Johnny U.

He swings up into the four-by and guns the engine.  Rosie
hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up
roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward
Roach's billowing gravemarker.

Johnny touches Tyler's face tenderly, leaving a smear of
blood.
He gives her a wan version of the Johnny Utah grin.

HOLD ON the truck moving off in a heat-shimmered cloud of
dust, becoming a mirage, then a memory as we--

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

AN ENORMOUS WAVE which FILLS FRAME, seeming to rise
endlessly before thundering down in a holocaust of spray.


EXT.  BEACH DAY - DAY

An unfamiliar beach laid waste by monster waves under a
storm sky.
Wind whips sand across the narrow beach-road, throwing it
against the front doors of the LIGHTHOUSE PUB.
TITLE OVER: ONE YEAR LATER...


INT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY

Dark.  Almost empty.  A snarling crocodile head is mounted
above a tapper of Guinness Stout.  A Koala bear with
plastic eyes holds a Foster's.  A BARTENDER with leathered
skin washes glasses.
At the bar, a single disheveled customer... human
driftwood.
GUST OF WIND blows open a shuttered window.
The bartender moves to close it.

                         BARTENDER
          Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore
          the bloody storm hits.

JOHNNY UTAH swivels toward CAMERA.  His tanned face is
barely recognizable, jaws hidden underneath a slight
beard, long bleach-out hair swept behind an ear.  His
muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey.
The man seems deadly focused.

                         UTAH
          Storm's already here... It's
          bringing me the swell.

Johnny stares into his drink.
ANOTHER BLAST OF COLD as the front door opens.
Johnny turns at the sound.
TYLER takes a step inside.  Her hair is different, more
bleached out, frazzled from the sun.  Her eyes adjust to
the dark room.

                         TYLER
          John, they're here.

Utah downs the drink and slides off his stool.  He has a
pronounced limps as he crosses to Tyler at the door.
They exit into daylight under an old wooden sign which
reads: LIGHTHOUSE PUB - BELL'S BEACH, AUSTRALIA

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY

UTAH and TYLER walk out onto the roadway as several
Australian Police cars converge on them.  A dozen
uniformed OFFICERS step out.  The ranking officer, a
fortyish LIEUTENANT, walks up to Utah.

                         LIEUTENANT
          D'you see him, Mr. Utah?

                         UTAH
          No.  But he's here.

                         LIEUTENANT
          Now, look, I know you used to be a
          federal agent up in the states and
          all that, but you're a citizen now,
          so just find him and we'll handle it
          from there.

                         UTAH
          No problem.  Just give me a couple
          minutes with him first.

Johnny limps out across the huge expanse of sand alone.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  BELL'S BEACH - AUSTRALIA - DAY

WALL OF SOLID WATER FIVE STORIES HIGH CRASHES straight
down in a holocaust of spray...
Rising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky, roll the
most terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen.  They
close out, pummeling the ocean floor, casting a shockwave
up the shore.
SURFERS gather on the sand, gaze out to sea.

                         1ST SURFER
          Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's
          shakin'.

The beach sounds like a MORTAR RANGE.
JOHNNY passes among the brahs.

                         2ND SURFER
          Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin'
          death on a stick.

ON BODHI, sitting crosslegged in the sand, arms folded
around his knees.  He stares pensively out at the waves.
His hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard
lying next to him.

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty
          year storm, Bodhi.

Bodhi smiles, the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates
the cunning of his opponent.  Utah sits beside his prey
and stares at the ocean.  Bodhi stares with glittering
eyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into
that feral, death's head grin.

                         BODHI
          And I always knew I could count on
          you, Agent Utah.

                         UTAH
          I'm not FBI anymore.

                         BODHI
          You never were...

                         UTAH
          I asked them to give me a couple
          minutes...

Utah calmly glances over his shoulder.
Bodhi follows Johnny's gaze to the cops watching from the
road.

                         BODHI
          It went bad, brah.  Real bad.
                  (smiles inwardly)
          I just felt it was time...

A BOOMING ROAR sounds from the ocean.
Bodhi just stares at the waves, with awe and perhaps fear.

                         BODHI
          Time to dance with the universe.
                  (he turns to Utah)
          I could never handle a jail cell.
          You'll do this for me, won't you
          Johnny?  Haven't I earned this
          much?

Utah doesn't move to stop him as he stands, hefting the
longboard.
He half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts
walking.
He stops.  Turns around.

                         BODHI
          Thanks, brah.

Bodhi doesn't wait for a reply.  He walks to the water's
edge, and never looks back.  He throws his board into the
foam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out.  The
monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the
trough of the holocaust.

UTAH stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver
final justice.  The cops are running clumsily across the
sand, too late to stop Bodhi.  Tyler steps up behind
Johnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders.

BODHI is nothing more than a SPECK as he shoots across the
lip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward -- AN
UNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends him into a 180 degree
slide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his
mouth opens in a soundless howl -- Bodhi and the outer-
limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious
moment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect
union... There is no fear in his face, only awe as the
mountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in a
whitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode
upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and
vanish.

UTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf.
Tyler lowers her head.  A fragment of surfboard washes up
onto wet sand.  The wind gathers force.
Johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her
shoulder, gathering her close.  Tears are streaming down
her face as she stares at the sea.

                         UTAH
          He rode it all the way.

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP, rising high above their heads as
the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the
Australian shore...

	(Opens when the camera is underwater.)

Voice
Who am I? I've been dreaming about this world which doesn't exist 
in my memory. 
	(Mew swims by)
Who are you? Wait! Am I apart of you...? Or not...?
	(Camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then 
it shows someone's eye open. Human figures are seen outside where 
he is.)
Where is this? Who am I? Who brought me here?
	
	(We now see who the voice belongs to, it's Mewtwo.)

Mewtwo
Who am I and why am I here? I just appeared here. I haven't even 
been born to this world yet. Who am I?
	(Mewtwo opens his eyes completely and shatters the glass 
and all the wires fall of him!)

Scientist
It has awakened!

Mewtwo
Did he do this? 

Scientist
Wonderful! Mewtwo has been completed.

   

Mewtwo
Mewtwo?

Scientist
That's you. We created you from a Mew the rarest pokémon in the 
world! Yes, that's the pokémon which is said to be the most rare 
of all pokémon. Mew.

Mewtwo
Mew? Is that my parent? My father? My mother?

Scientist
You can say that, but not really. You've been made stronger based 
on a Mew.

Mewtwo
Who is this? If neither my father nor mother. Then was it god? 
Did God create me?

Scientist
In the world the only ones that can create new life is man and 
god.

Mewtwo
Who did this? Humans made me?

Scientist
This is truly a victory for science.

Another scientist
With this we've proven our theory correct. We can continue the 
study.

Third scientist
This place will become the new Mecca.

Scientist
	(all shaking hands)
I'm going to contact the other offices.

Mewtwo
Who am I? Where is this place? What was I born for?
	(Mewtwo floats up and starts destroying the whole lab. Then 
tons of little metal hand like things come down to stop him but 
he just blows them up. Soon the whole lab is in flames.)

Scientist
To make the strongest pokémon ever.. that was our dream...
	(The whole lab blows up. Giovanni, the leader of Team 
Rocket comes down in a chopper and confronts Mewtwo.)

Mewtwo
Is this my power? I'm the strongest pokémon in the world. Mew. Am 
I stronger then you?

Giovanni
You surly are the strongest pokémon in the world. But there is 
another that would be the strongest.

Mewtwo
The humans?

Giovanni

	(nods)
If you and a human were to cooperate then the world would be 
ours.

  

Mewtwo
The world would be ours?

Giovanni
If your power is set free the world would be ruined. You must 
control your power.

Mewtwo
Control?

Giovanni
Are you okay with destroying the world as it is with that power?

Mewtwo
What should I do? 
	(Giovanni smiles. Mewtwo is at TRHQ getting loads of armor 
put on.)

Mewtwo
Control myself with the armor that protects me? What are you 
going to make me do?

Giovanni
It's simple. All you have to do are the things everyone else has 
been doing...

Mewtwo
and that is?

Giovanni
Fighting, destruction, and plunder. The stronger will win.

--------------------------------------------------------
Mewtwo is sent into an arena to fight pokémon first an Onix which 
Mewtwo throws into a wall with his mind. Then it shows Mewtwo out 
in a field with a lot of wild Tauros. He raises them up with his 
mind control and TR throws pokéballs out and catches them all. 
Then it shows Mewtwo in the gym again fighting Alakazam, Mewtwo 
does just what he did to Onix. Then came Electron and he used an 
electric attack and Mewtwo reflected it back at him. Next came 
Gary's Arcanine and Nidoking... he took care of them easily. Next 
scene, back in Giovanni's lab.
--------------------------------------------------------

Mewtwo
What am I fighting for? What am I living for?

Giovanni
You are a pokémon. Pokémon made by humans, what else are you 
worth?

Mewtwo
My worth? Who am I? What do I live for?
	(Mewtwo starts breaking free of the wires)

Giovanni
What are you doing?

Mewtwo
I was made by humans. But I, who was created by humans, am not 
even a pokémon.
	(Mewtwo blows up the place and flies off while all his 
armor slowly falls of into the sea. He lands on a rock.)
Who am I? Where is this place? Who asked to make me? Who wished 
to make me? I hate everything that made me! So this is neither an 
attack not a declaration of war but revenge on you who made me!

----------------------------------------------------
Introduction
----------------------------------------------------


	(Brock is cooking lunch for everyone.)

Narrator
Ash and the others are on a journey training to be pokémon 
masters. It's a beautiful day so they take a break in a field.

Ash
Is it ready yet?

Misty
Ash you can help too.

Ash
I can't I can't even move one millimeter because I'm so starved.

Brock
Stew well and raise slowly. You mustn't be in a rush with both 
soup or pokémon.
	(Pikachu and Togepy spot someone coming)

Pirate
Hey you! The boy over there! Are you Ash from Pallet Town?

Ash
That's right.

Pirate
Can I have a Pokémon battle with you?

Ash

	(runs over to him)
Okay! I must have a solid fight!

Misty
I thought you couldn't move one millimeter?

Ash
Just one or two pokémon fights before breakfast.

Brock
This is lunch, so that would be before lunch.

Pikachu
pika..chu...


	(Has the Japanese Pokémon intro music through this battle 
the whole time. Ash pulls out a pokéball and throws out 
Bulbasaur. Then the pirate throws out Donfan. Bulbasaur charges 
and Donfan rolls into a ball and hits Bulbasaur, then turns 
around and hits him again! Then he tries it again but Bulbasaur 
uses Solar Beam and Donfan faints. The Pirate then sends out 
Machamp. Ash sends out Squirtle. Machamp kicks Squirtle down and 
then goes to kick him again but Squirtle dodges it and bubbles 
him till Machamp faints. The pirate gets mad and throws 3 
pokéballs down. one is a Venomoth another is a Golem and the 
other is a Pinsir. Pikachu jumps off ashes shoulder and does 
Thundershock and all 3 faint.)

   

Pirate
Oh My God! 
	(this was possibly the funniest part of the entire movie :)

Ash
I did it!

Misty
It was just because your opponent was weak.

Brock
He didn't even raise them well


	(flash to Team Rocket who is on a cliff watching our 
heroes.)

James
Pikachu gets stronger and stronger.

Jessie
Beautiful

Meowth
We couldn't beat him even once. But the word surrender isn't in 
our dictionary.

Jessie
I will get that Pikachu.

James
But look at that. 
	(looks at them all eating)

Meowth
I'm so hungry.

Jessie
I got a frying pan...

Meowth
What good is such a thing without meat and vegetables? It's just 
an iron board.

---------------------------------------------
A Fearow with a camera flies over head then it shows inside some 
place where you can see Ash and Pikachu on the screens.
---------------------------------------------

     

Lady
Are you sending them an invitation?

Mewtwo
Certainly.
	(Dragonite flies out of the control center with a purse. It 
flies over the sees and then over Team Rocket and they fall then 
it flies over Ash and everyone's head knocking them all over then 
she lands.)

Ash
What are you? 
	(Dragonite hands Ash an invitation)
This? For me?
	(He hits a button and a hologram of the lady is displayed)

Lady
Please forgive me for the abrupt letter.

Brock
What a beautiful lady...

Lady
Since you are a promising pokémon trainer of the future, we'd 
like to invite you to a party of my master who is the strongest 
pokémon trainer in the world. The place is the New Island, 
Pokémon Castle. Please check the reply card for whether your 
coming or not. Please accept the invitation for the strongest 
trainer in the world.

Brock
Beautiful Lady...

Misty
What do we do?

Brock
Lets go for it. We should go for it.

Ash
I don't feel uncomfortable with being told I'm a promising future 
trainer.

Misty
Well then check yes on the card.


	(They check yes, and hand the invitation back to Dragonite. 
Dragonite takes the card and flies off but Jessie, James and 
Meowth take out a net in an attempt to steal this rare pokémon. 
Ash's invitation falls out of Dragonites purse.)

Jessie
Don't say Goodbye without saying hello.

Meowth
a post card?

---------------------------------------------
Scene change. We see Mewtwo waving his hand back and forth moving 
the clouds, causing a big storm to start. We then see mew 
sleeping in a bubble underwater as the bubble floats to the top 
and pops, Mew wakes up and flies off. Ash and everyone run out of 
the storm and into a ocean side house that has all the other 
trainers who were invited.
---------------------------------------------

A Trainer
Calm down Kingler! Cut it out!
	(Our heroes run inside wet.)

Ash
It was a beautiful day!

Brock
The weather along this beach can change easily.
	(we notice a big crowd of trainers by the door and Officer 
Jenny standing with a woman talking to them all)

Crowd
Huh? The ferry has been canceled?

Sweet
We can't go to the New Island?!

Crowd
Oh No! We were invited to go!

Officer Jenny
Be quiet everyone. Here is the Pier Master.

Boijer
I'm Boijer. If you want to know about the sea ask the seagulls on 
the pier. No need to bother. Just look at the flaw of the clouds. 
I've never seen such a hurricane in all my years.

Officer Jenny
Is it that terrible?

Boijer
I grew up on a port and I've never experienced such a storm. 
Besides the storm is above New Island offshore of this pier. I 
can't let you be placed in danger. That's my wish as the one who 
guards this pier.

Officer Jenny
As you heard the ferry has been cancelled.

Umio
Its okay with my pokémon. My pokémon are stronger in water. I can 
cross the sea.

Boijer
Wait. I'm the one who knows the sea and I say no!

Officer Jenny
She's right! Besides if the pokémon were to get hurt now they 
wouldn't be able to get treatment at a Pokémon Center.

Ash
What do you mean?

Officer Jenny
Nurse Joy at the Pokémon Center is missing. Pokémon can't receive 
treatment without Nurse Joy. The poster over there is the missing 
person report
	(Brock looks at it)

Brock
Beautiful... Who? I've seen her somewhere before...
	(Some of the trainers go outside in the storm wanting to 
cross the ocean. Soroa gets onto his Pidgeot and flies off. Umio 
gets on his Gyarados and swims across.)

Officer Jenny
Stop! Stop or I'll arrest you!
	(Sweet gets on her Dewgong and starts swimming away.)

Boijer
There's no use trying to stop them. After all they're pokémon 
trainers. If they were children who would stop after being told 
to, they wouldn't have gathered here. Let's just pray for there 
safety.
	(Ash, Brock, Misty and Pikachu run outside and see everyone 
leaving.)

Ash
Across the sea lives the strongest trainer in the world. I can't 
cop out now.

Misty
But we can't cross this sea using our pokémon.

Ash
Right.
	(A Small wooden ship pulls up with 2 people in it. Guess 
who?)

Jessie
Want a ride? Not saying that it's free but depending on the 
situation. I might allow you onboard. 
	(They get on and start going and Meowth is dressed like a 
girl in front of the boat, then a huge wave and Team Rocket's 
costumes fall off. then the waves start getting really rough.)

Ash
You guys! You guys again?!

Brock
You guys appear at the very worst times!

Ash
What do you want?

Jessie
If we're asked what we want...

James
The answer to that is..

Meowth
There's no time for saying that!
	(A huge wave flips the boat. Misty shoots out Staryu and 
swims to the surface.)

Brock
Ash! Misty!
	(Misty comes up and he grabs onto Staryu.)

Misty
Where is Ash and Pikachu?!
(A big wave comes again, and they go back under and see As h 
swimming up with Squirtle.)

  

Ash
Hold on tight everyone!
	(Squirtle and Staryu keep swimming under the waves until 
they see light. Then it shows Mew flying above the clouds. Ash 
and everyone get to the castle and climb out of the water, and 
the mysterious lady is standing there.

Lady
Welcome to the New Island. Please show me your invitation.

Ash
How's this?
	(He shows her).

B rock
That was you just as I thought!

Lady
Yes?

Brock
That picture of Nurse Joy I saw in the missing person report at 
the pier was you.

Misty
That reminds me, she looks like her.

Lady
I don't know what your talking about. I've been serving this 
castle ever since I was born. Come this way. The other guests are 
already waiting.

---------------------------------------------
They go inside and Team Rocket floats up from the water on top of 
Weezing. Then it shows Mew playing with the windmill on top of 
the castle. MEANWHILE Ash and everyone are inside the castle.
---------------------------------------------

Lady
Those are the trainers who have already arrived.

Ash
Only 3?

Lady
The trainers who couldn't cross that storm aren't worth inviting.

Brock
So then you tested us?

Lady
Please take out the pokémon from the pokéballs and be seated. You 
are the chosen trainers.

James

	(outside and the front door shuts)
Well then, let's sneak into this castle...

Jessie
The only way is to use the exit.

Meowth
Where's the exit?

Jessie
Over there...

Meowth
The s..s..sewer!? I'm not a brown rat!

Jessie
Don't complain!
	(All of a sudden Mew comes down from behind TR and looks at 
them. Jessie turns her head but Mew disappeared.)

James
What's wrong Jessie?

Jessie
Nothing lets go.

---------------------------------------------
Meanwhile...
---------------------------------------------

Sorao
You came too?

Ash
You?

Sorao
I flew here. My Pidgeot can cross such a hurricane in one flight. 
Everyone greet them! 
	(all his pokémon say their names Then they see a Gyarados.)

Umio
That's my Gyarados. I rode him across the sea. Those kind of 
waves are nothing for it. 

Ash
Gyarados is a brutal pokémon isn't it?

Umio
Yeah, but if you can handle it, no one is more reliable.

Sweet
My pokémon are just the same over there. 
	(points to her Blastoise, Wigglytuff, and more. Then all 
the lights turn off, there is a bright beam of light coming down 
the center of a huge spiral staircase.)

Lady
That you for waiting everyone. The strongest pokémon trainer is 
coming. 
	(All of a sudden Mewtwo starts floating down and all the 
pokémon get worried.)


Lady
Yes, this is the strongest pokémon trainer and strongest pokémon. 
Mr. Mewtwo.
	(The lights come back on and everyone can see him clearly.)

Ash
Mewtwo?

Umio
A Pokémon is a pokémon trainer? It can't be. 
	(It becomes apparent that MewTwo is telepathically 
controlling Joy...)

Mewtwo
I've decided my own rules.

Misty
That voice!

Brock
Telepathy!
	(Mewtwo raises Umio up in the air and throws him into a 
pool 
	(using his mind)

Umio
Darn it! Go Gyarados!
	(Gyarados attacks with Hyper Beam, it goes to Mewtwo and 
Mewtwo stops it and turns it around and it hits Gyarados causing 
it to faint.)

Mewtwo
That was easy. 
	(looks at Joy)
I no longer have any need for you anymore.
	(Joy faints into Brock's arms)

Brock
Nurse Joy.

Nurse Joy
Where is this place? Why am I here?

Mewtwo
To make you take care of me, I took you from the Pokémon Center. 
A doctor who is familiar with pokémon is convenient. You were 
quite useful. You don't remember anything though.

Brock
What did you say?

Mewtwo
Humans can be manipulated in any way with my power.

Misty
With what power?

Pikachu
PIKA!
	(Meanwhile TR are in the castle and they find a strange 
room and they enter it.)


Meowth
What is this place? 
	(They look and see a Charizard, Venusaur and a Blastoise in 
Big Glass Test Tubes sleeping.)

Meowth
Cute!

James
Is it really?

Jessie
These aren't like any treasures I've seen.
	(Jessie walks away and sits on some button and a computer 
turns on with a very fuzzy screen.)

Computer
...our study... to continue in our research ... we would have to 
collect samples from our test subjects...
	(All of a sudden something grabs Meowth and throws him in a 
machine)

Meowth
HELP! HELP!

Jessie
Meowth!
	(Both Jessie and James start pull to get Meowth out and 
they do get him out but not before the machine got 3 hairs from 
off of his tail.)

Meowth
OUCH! My hair!
	(on the computer screen a figure of a Meowth shows up and 
the computer starts saying some weird stuff then in an empty test 
tube next to Team Rocket, a Meowth falls down from a pipe into 
it)

All of TR
MEOWTH?!

Meowth
I am Meowth.

James
Then this is.... Meowth's copy? 
	(Mew appears behind Team Rocket again.)

Computer
But the copy we created is more than we've imaged. The pokémon 
which we found.... in the depths... it's name is Mew... We 
succeeded in finding fossilized eye lashes of a mew. From the 
gathered components we created Mewtwo with this machine. The goal 
was to make the strongest pokémon with our own hands. That was 
our dream. But soon Mewtwo displayed unmeasurable violence. Its 
all over. The research office will be destroyed. The only way 
left to abandon this place and escape. 
	(the computer shuts off)

Jessie
This is the research office?

James
I think so.

Meowth
Yeah

James
But there's nothing wrong with it.

Jessie
Or maybe something created it again.

James
But who?

Mewtwo
I thought of working with humans once. But I was disappointed. 
Humans are the worst creatures inferior to pokémon. If creatures 
that are weak and cruel like humans control this world, this 
planet will come to ruin. 

Brock
Are you saying like your gonna rule it?

Mewtwo

	(shakes his head)
Pokémon are no good either because this planet is ruled by humans 
our pokémon... pokémon who lived for humans.

Pikachu
Pika..pika pika!

Mewtwo
What did you say? You're not being controlled? You're with the 
humans because you want to be? To be with them by itself is 
wrong.
	(Mewtwo lifts Pikachu up with his mind and throws him but 
Ash jumps back and catches him!)

Pikachu
pika!

Ash
Pikachu!

Mewtwo
Weak pokémon rely on humans.

Misty
Ash! Are you ok?

Ash
Yeah. How dare you attack Pikachu?!

Soroa
We can get him no matter what kind of pokémon he is, as long as 
he's a pokémon, GO RYHORN!
	(Ryhorn charges at Mewtwo and is 1 inch from him and Mewtwo 
stops him and raises him into the air, and shoots Ryhorn across 
the room!)

 

Soroa
Ryhorn!

Mewtwo
It's no use. I was born as the strongest of any pokémon in the 
world.

Ash
You don't know that before we try.

Mewtwo
You wan to try?

Ash
We can ask for nothing better.

--------------------------------------------------------
Mewtwo eyes start glowing then it shows in the lab with Team 
Rocket in it Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise come out of there 
test tubes and walk out the door. then Mew flies out with them.
--------------------------------------------------------

James
Was that a..?

Jessie
Mew?



Mewtwo
Any human who are aiming to be pokémon trainers go first. 
Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur.
	(The 3 copies raise up from the ground.)These are the 
evolved forms of the copies I've made. 

Sweet
Copies?

Soroa
They are...?
	(Everything starts shaking and a huge door opens and inside 
is a pokémon battle field.)

Brock
A battle field? Is he going to have a pokémon battle?

Soroa
I've got Venusaur for that copy one!

Sweet
I've got Blastoise for that copy one!

Ash
I've got Charizard too. Charizard I chose you!
	(Charizard comes out and gives Mewtwo and evil look then 
shoots fire out at him but Mewtwo makes a force field around him 
so it doesn't even touch him.)
Charizard, that's a surprise attack. 
	(Mewtwo shoots up water and the fire goes out.)

Mewtwo
What a bad tempered Charizard. So who's first?
	(Soroa's Venusaur walks out.)


Soroa
I was careless before, but it won't go that way this time.


	(The copied Venusaur walks out.)

Soroa
Venusaur! Razorleaf!

Mewtwo
Vine Whip.
	(Copied Venusaur's vines chop up the razor leafs then his 
vines wrap around Venusaur and tosses him across the room!)

Soroa
Venusaur!

Sweet
I'm next! Go Blastoise!
	(Mewtwo points for copied Blastoise to go.)

Sweet
Blastoise, Hydro Pump!
	(Copied Blastoise spins right threw the water and hits 
Blastoise causes him to go crashing hard into the wall.)

Sweet
Blastoise!

 

Misty
Be careful Ash! His skills are strong!

Ash
I know.
	(Mewtwo signals Copied Charizard to go.)

Ash
Charizard! Lets fight with speed not power! Okay go!
	(Both Charizard fly up. Ashes Charizard keeps using Flame-
thrower but copied Charizard dodges them all and keeps hitting 
Charizard in the stomach.)

Misty
Where are the speed attacks?

Brock
The enemy is to fast!
	(Copied Charizard grabs Charizard and starts flying down to 
the ground!)

Ash
Charizard!

Mewtwo
Dive Bomb Slam!

Charizard hits into the ground then gets up.. roars loudly.. then 
faints.

Ash

	(Runs out to Charizard)
Hold on Charizard! Are you okay?

Mewtwo
Both speed and power are lacking.
	(Mewtwo then throws his hands up and 3 black pokéballs 
appear he shoots them all out and captures Sweet's Blastoise 
another gets Soroa's Venusaur and the other captures ashes 
Charizard! A small gold statue lifts up and the 3 balls shoot 
down into the hole.)

Ash
STOP!

Misty
Are you taking the other's pokémon?!

Mewtwo
Taking them? No. I'm going to make stronger copies than the 
pokémon you are so proud of.
	(Mewtwo raises his arms again and hundreds of Black 
pokéballs appear!)
It's suitable enough for me.

Brock
Copies?

Ash
Stop! That's a violation of the rules!

Mewtwo
Don't tell me what to do. 
	(Mewtwo looks at Ash and throws him into Brock)
I've decided my own rules.
	(Mewtwo drops his arms and all the black pokéballs start 
flying everywhere)

Brock
They're Coming!

Ash
Run everyone!

--------------------------------------------------------
The pokéballs are everywhere catching the trainers pokémon, the 
Gyarados was caught then the Golduck, then Seaking, then Scyther, 
then Hitmonlee, then Sandslash the trainers are trying to protect 
there pokémon but there is nothing they can do! then Dewgong was 
caught, then Rapidash, then Vileplume. Then Bulbasaur and 
Squirtle are fighting them off, then Wigglytuff was caught, then 
Pidgeot and when they get caught the pokéballs fly back into the 
whole under the statue lifted up in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------

Ash
I've got it! Take your own pokémon back to your own pokéballs! 
Return Squirtle and Bulbasaur! 
	(they both go back into their pokéballs)


  

Mewtwo
It's no use.
	(2 black pokéballs go to Ash, open, and capture the 
pokéballs Bulbasaur and Squirtle are in!)
Nothing is impossible with the black pokéballs I have made. 
	(Misty puts Togepy in her bag and shuts it tight while 
Brock holds Vulpix close.)

Nurse Joy
This place is no good. Let's run outside!
	(Nurse Joy, Psyduck, Misty and Brock start running but then 
a black ball catches Psyduck)

Misty
My Psyduck!
	(A black ball catches Vulpix.)

Brock
Vulpix!
	(Pikachu is being hunted down by tons of black pokéballs! 
Then Pikachu falls and is about to be caught! But Ash jumps in 
front of him and the pokéballs hit him.)

Ash
Run Pikachu! 
	(Pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs 
with ash running after him. Pikachu keeps using Thundershock to 
blow up all the pokéballs around him but more keep coming! Ash 
starts running up the stairs a little behind Pikachu)
Don't give up Pikachu! 
	(Pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the 
stairs! Ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a 
black pokéballs snatches Pikachu! But Ash catches the pokéball 
and then falls into some water but when he does the pokéballs 
slips out of his hands and goes into the hole. Since it was the 
last pokémon the statue starts to drop but Ash just barely makes 
it and jumps down into the hole after the Pikachu in the ball! 
Team Rocket is still in the Lab, which is where all the copies 
are going. They are amazed at all the copies dropping into all 
the test tubes everywhere but then Ash falls down chasing after 
Pikachu!)

Jessie
Brat?

Ash
I'm sorry, I don't have time to deal with you today!
	(Ash jumps and grabs Pikachu's pokéball but right when he 
does about 25 little metal mini hand like things come down trying 
to keep Pikachu, Ash is fighting off the mini hands.)
Let it go! Darn it! Let him go! Let go of my Pikachu! Let go! 
	(All the hands break and the whole copy machine starts 
blowing up and Pikachu comes out of his ball.)
Pikachu!

Pikachu
Pika!

But then all the Copy pokémon start coming out of there tubes 
because the whole copy machine is all blown up. All the copies 
start walking out of the room.

Jessie
Oh no! There coming out!

Meowth
My copy to!

Ash
Those are all copies?

Jessie
Where are they all going?

All of a sudden there's an explosion and all the black pokéballs 
come out and all the original pokémon come out!

James
The real ones have come out to!

2 of the black balls open and 2 normal pokéballs come out, then 
those open and Squirtle and Bulbasaur come out! Ash and Pikachu 
runs over and starts laughing and hugging each other then ash 
stops and looks up and looks angry!

Meanwhile up stairs...

Mewtwo
Humans, I won't take your lives too. Leave here.

The doors open to the exit.

Mewtwo
That is if you an make it out in that storm.

Then there is an explosion and all the copied pokémon come 
walking out.

Mewtwo
What happened here?

From the smoke, Ash and all the original pokémon come walking 
out.

Ash
I can not forgive...! I will not forgive you!

Misty/Brock
Ash!

Misty

	(sees Psyduck)
Psyduck!

Brock

	(sees Vulpix)
Vulpix!

Mewtwo
Did you set them free?

Ash
I will protect my pokémon, my friends.
	(Ash charges at Mewtwo and goes to punch him but Mewtwo 
throws him down to the ground. Ash gets up and tries again and 
Mewtwo lifts him up.)

Misty
Ash!

Brock
Stop!
	(Mewtwo throws Ash into a huge statue but just as he's 
about to hit it -which we know would really hurt
a pink bubble stops him and Ash bounces a few times on that.)

Mewtwo
What?
	(Mew flies up to Ash and stares at him, Ash then looks at 
Mew and Mew pops the bubble and Ash falls -only like a foot then 
Mew starts giggling.)
You're... 
	(Mew makes another bubble and starts jumping up and own on 
it giggling and having a good time, then Mewtwo makes a black 
electric ball and shoots it up and it pops mew bubble. Mew turns 
around and looks at Mewtwo confused. Mewtwo makes another and 
blows up when it hits Mew. Mewtwo makes 3 more and throws them 
all up at Mew, Mew dodges them all and starts giggling again.)

Brock
That's...

Misty
Pokémon?

Mew flies down and looks at Mewtwo

Mewtwo
Mew. The pokémon that's supposed to be the rarest pokémon in the 
world.

Brock
Mew? 
	(Mew looks around at everyone... I love this guy!)

Mewtwo
I was made from you. But I am the stronger one...I am the true 
one.
	(Mew is still looking around acting like its paying no 
attention to Mewtwo.)

Brock
Mew and Mewtwo.

Sweet
Mewtwo was made from Mew.

Mewtwo

	(starts glowing)
I am the only one who will survive. 
	(Mewtwo starts chasing mew everywhere shooting tons of 
those black electric balls at him. But Mew keeps running away 
dodging everything.)

Mewtwo
Who don't you want to fight? The reason why you avoid fighting is 
because your afraid of me? 
	(Mewtwo makes another black electric ball and shoots it at 
Mew and knocks Mew right in the face and mew goes flying in the 
distance. Everyone is then shocked, but then the same type of 
ball only blue comes back and hits Mewtwo and he goes into a 
wall. Mew flies back down. and Mewtwo floats up from the fire and 
rubble. TR Enters the room.)

Mewtwo
Your attacks are ineffective against me. Now is the time to 
decide which one of us is the true one, you the copy... which is 
the stronger? We were made stronger than the real ones.

Mew
mew, mew..mew mew mew...mew, mew..mew mew mew

Meowth
I see.

Jessie
What is it saying?

Meowth
The real one is real. If they fight only using bodies without 
skills. The true ones will not be beaten by their copies

Mewtwo
The real one is real?.... Fine! 
	(Mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at Mew but Mew 
dodges it and just barely misses Ash! Ash then starts climbing 
down the statue.)
Lets decide which is the real one without skills. You're the 
stronger ones, GO! 
	(All the copies start attacking their originals. The copies 
are winning. Mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around 
himself. Mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high 
in the air and keep ramming into each other. Then Pikachu is 
looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing 
there ready to fight him! Pikachu can't believe it.)


Nurse Joy
What is this fighting? Both the real ones and copies are alive 
now.

Sweet
Everyone is a living thing

Brock
Though they were created, there are living beings that live in 
this world.

Misty
The real ones and the copies... But both of them are the same 
living things. There's no such thing as a win and losing.

James
If we were asked that, I wouldn't know what to say

Jessie
I feel so sorry

James
They're bullying themselves.

Jessie
Its like seeing what we used to be.

James
Its like seeing what we are now.

Both
Feels Bad! 
	(Meowth's copy walks up to Meowth.)

Meowth
Its you! 
	(they take out there claws and are ready fight)
This is gonna hurt. But every pokémon is fighting each other, 
you're unfair.

Copy Meowth
Meow meow...

Meowth
What? I'm more unfair? It's because I'm not fighting with you? 
Your nails would hurt more wouldn't they?

Copy Meowth
meow meow meow

Meowth
You said tonight's moon would be round? You're right, it must be 
a full moon.

Copy Meowth
meow meow

Meowth
Talking about the moon at a time like this is tasteful. Its 
philosophical.
	(Meanwhile Mew and Mewtwo are still bouncing around 
fighting. And Ash finally makes it back to the ground.)

Ash

	(looks at everyone fighting and getting so tired)
That's Enough! Stop!

Brock
Ash!

Ash
I've got to stop them.

Brock
No. The battle will continue unless Mew and Mewtwo stop fighting.

Nurse Joy
Animals don't hand over there territory to the same type of 
animal.

Misty
oh no.

Nurse Joy
They will fight until they drive their opponents away. That is 
the way of living beings.

Brock
That may be for living beings but Mewtwo was made by humans.

Misty
But now he's a living being. 

Ash
Now they are all living beings. Mew and Mewtwo, Pikachu and that 
other Pikachu. 
	(Mew and Mewtwo's fight finally goes on ground and they 
both take off there force field. Mew and Mewtwo both shoots a 
beam out at each other and starts to run between them not seeing 
the 2 beams coming!)
Stop!

Brock
Ash! 
	(Both beams hit Ash and he falls to the ground and turns to 
stone.)

Mewtwo
It can't be. A human tried to stop our fight. 
	(Pikachu runs out to Ash and starts shaking Ash. Then he 
thunder shocks him many times and Ash still doesn't move. Pikachu 
begins to cry. Then all the other pokémon look at Pikachu -
including the copies
and they start crying. All there tears float over and land on ash 
then last, Pikachu's tears fall onto Ash and Ash regains his hold 
on life, and turns back to flesh from rock)

Ash
Pikachu!

Pikachu
Pika pi!!

Mewtwo
Actually, both you and I are pokémon that already exist.

Mew
mew.

Mewtwo
It might be better if no one knows about us, or any of this...

Mew
mew...
	(Mew and Mewtwo start flying away and then all the copies 
pokémon lift up into the air and fly with them!)

Ash
Why are you going everyone?

Mewtwo

	(flying away with all the copies)
We were born and alive. We will continue to live somewhere in 
this world. 
	(All of a sudden the whole castle fills up with bright 
light and everyone disappears......... Now we are back where all 
the trainers what to go on the ferry.)

Officer Jenny
The ferry has been canceled! There's a hurricane coming!

Nurse Joy

	(walks through the crowd)
Don't worry everyone. I'm going to open the Pokémon Center as a 
shelter. Follow me those who need it.

Brock
Nurse Joy, the officer, and Ms. Boijer. Even more beautiful than 
usual when they are wet by the rain.

Ash
But why are we here?

Misty
I don't know. We're here because we're here.

Ash
It doesn't matter. Well... Huh? 
	(Everyone runs outside)
It can't be...

Officer Jenny
The hurricane... it's as if it never existed.

Boijer
I can run the ferry for again tomorrow.

Ash

	(looks up and sees a mew in the sky)
Look.

Misty
What? I can't see anything.

Brock
Besides the clouds.

Ash
On the day I left to become a pokémon trainer, I saw a phantom 
pokémon... and now.. I've seen it again.

Brock
Phantom Pokémon.

Ash
Yes, someday I will 
	(Meanwhile, TR is still on the New Island except now the 
castle is gone.)

Jessie
Well if its this empty...

James
Clean and clear...

Meowth
And different than it usually is. 

Jessie/James/Meowth
FEELS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!

    FADE IN:


1   EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY                            1

    Jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear
    PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer
    appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he
    carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten,
    history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN.

    His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered
    sign: "The Great Salt Lake Marina." They start down a
    slope and begin to cross a...


    DRY LAKE BED

    A bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee-
    to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the
    plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house
    boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               The last of the great cities died
               when my father was a child.
               Another victim of yet another war.
               The plagues followed. And the
               terrors. The living hid
               themselves away in tiny hamlets in
               hopes of surviving whatever new
               madness conspired to rob them of
               the little that remained. The
               Earth itself had fallen prey to
               chaos. For three years a dirty
               snow fell that even summer could
               not erase. The ocean was barren.
               Poisoned. Near death.

    As The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.
    He's soon lost in the massive vista.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Sixteen long years passed before
               the great lungs started working
               again. My father said it was as
               if the ocean breathed a great sigh
               of relief...

    A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just
    sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run.
    Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these
    boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

1   CONTINUED:                                                   1

    TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the
    sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of
    depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as --


    MAN'S FOOTPRINTS

    These tracks may already be days old as they fill with
    rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS.
    A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big
    cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low,
    disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner
    plans -- for now.


2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2

    A bullet-ridden sign reads: "U.S. 84 North." The Postman
    leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through
    the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the
    median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The
    Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole
    and continues.

    BILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer:

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I don't know. And if you ask me
                 again, I'm going to slug you.

    They near a sign: "Thank You For Visiting Utah." The
    Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 It's been fun, hasn't it, kids?
                        (to the sign)
                 You're welcome!


3   EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY                        3

    Bill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder
    on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon.

    Above, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He
    references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon
    through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a
    Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.

                                                            4.

4   EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY                        4

    A 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's.
    Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule.
    Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped
    fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo
    foundation which bristles with burned timbers.

    Bill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at
    him with his hat.

                            THE POSTMAN
              Damnit, Bill, you know I need to
              check it first!

    Bill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack.
    He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its
    contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several
    small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops
    from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny
    strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid
    purple. The Postman is dubious.

                            THE POSTMAN
              Better than turpentine.
                     (touches some
                      to his lips)
              Tastes about the same. Your call,
              Bill.

    Bill drinks.

                            THE POSTMAN
              You ain't picky, Bill. I like
              that about you.

    The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and
    crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the
    ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree
    bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over.
    Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the
    20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color
    before.

    The Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling
    ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.


5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5

    A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds
    a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              5.

5   CONTINUED:                                                      5

                               THE POSTMAN
                 'Running on Empty'? Tell me about
                 it.

    Tossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of
    trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles.

                                THE POSTMAN
                 Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147
                 channels. Everything from Jesus
                 to 'Jeopardy'.

    He steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but
    The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static,
    then:

                               THE POSTMAN
                 'Like sands through the hour-
                 glass, so are the days of our
                 lives...'
                        (switching channels)
                 'Michael Shields, come on down,
                 you're the next contestant
                 on...'The Price is Right'.'
                        (switching again)
                 I'll take Domestic Nuclear
                 Disasters for two hundred
                 thousand, Alex...

    The Postman stops suddenly.    Click.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 We interrupt our regularly
                 scheduled program to bring you the
                 Second Civil War... Well, shit.

    The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's
    a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service
    manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the
    carbine.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I don't want any trouble... I bet
                 you don't either... Let's just
                 call it a draw, okay?

    Sudden MOVEMENT. The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe
    dashes out from behind the desk. Scared, it bounds back
    and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner.
    The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Look out, Bill!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               6.

5   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               5

    The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill.
    Bill has a conniption fit.

    Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette
    machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are
    empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's
    intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the
    machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.

    The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of
    cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm rich.


6   EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT                                         6

    Embers of a campfire glow.    The Postman is asleep, the
    carbine in reach.

    BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman
    reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a
    shotgun pointed in his face.

    Three BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is
    mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a
    shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks
    the carbine out of reach.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm just passing through. I don't
                 mean anyone any harm.
                        (re: stream)
                 Water's good.

    The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the
    muzzle of his rifle. The Postman knows why.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm not a Holnist.

    The Lead Bandit pokes again. Harder. The Postman opens
    his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Okay?

    They just stare at him, none saying a word.      Creepy.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 I'm headed for a town called St.
                 Rose. Somewhere west of Portland.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             7.

6   CONTINUED:                                                     6

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Portland's under twenty feet of
                 water.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Well, I heard different.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 You mouthin' me?

                               THE POSTMAN
                 No, it's just that it's hard to
                 get good information.

    The third BANDIT, a HULKING brute, has been quiet.

                               HULKING BANDIT
                 He is mouthin' you; I say we kill
                 him.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Don't be in such a rush, Martin.
                        (back to
                         The Postman)
                 Now I see a pack mule over there,
                 but I don't see no packs.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 This is all I got.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Oh... Kill him, Martin.

    The Hulking Bandit, raises his shotgun. The butt end.
    He's going to bludgeon The Postman to death.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (pointing)
                 Okay!   My stuff's up there!

    The 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. In the gloom
    you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.

                               BANDIT #20
                 What do you got in there?

    The Lead Bandit swats Bandit #20 upside the head.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Shut up.
                        (to Postman)
                 What do you got in there?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               8.

6   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               6

                                THE POSTMAN
                 Dried peas.   Beef jerky.
                 Cigarettes.

                                ALL THREE BANDITS
                 Cigarettes!

                                THE POSTMAN
                 Sure.   There's the ladder.

                               BANDIT #20
                 Maybe he's got it booby-trapped.

    The Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit #20 again -- then
    he sees the logic out of it. The Postman shakes his head,
    but isn't that convincing.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 You go up and get it.

                                                     CUT TO:


7   EXT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             7

    The ladder set against the bent pole. Prodded by a
    shotgun, The Postman climbs, disappears through the hole
    and into the tilting 76 ball.


8   INT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             8

    Full of The Postman's earthly possessions. Trick is, how
    to save them and his life at the same time. He spies an
    old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty
    bolts holding the ball in place. An idea begins to take
    shape.

                               LEAD BANDIT (O.S.)
                 Just you start tossing those
                 cigarettes down!


    BANDITS

    There's no answer.     The Bandits eye each other nervously.

                               BANDIT #20
                 Maybe he fell asleep.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

    76 BALL

    The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the
    last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give...

                               THE POSTMAN
                 It's going to take a second.    I
                 got my stuff bolted in.


    BANDITS

    The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 Put some buckshot through it,
                 Martin. Just to hurry him up.

                               HULKING BANDIT
                 I only got three shells left.

                               LEAD BANDIT
                 So use his gun.

    The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK.
    It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside,
    pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb.


    76 BALL

    Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball,
    trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't
    budge.


    LADDER

    The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.


    76 BALL

    No good.   Time's up.   The Postman starts rocking the pole.


    LADDER

    The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the
    rocking motion. Hangs on.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          10.

    76 BALL

    Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that
    instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The
    rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in
    place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before
    going with the pole's tilt.


    LADDER

    The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking
    Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other
    Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.


    THE POSTMAN

    whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.


    FIELD

    The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a
    stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts
    apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his
    feet.

                               THE POSTMAN
                 Bill!

    Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the
    RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman.

    Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before
    a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head.
    Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge,
    quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first.

    Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over
    Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit
    aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights.

    He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the
    SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and
    he's laughing like a hyena!

                               BANDIT #20
                 We're rich!

                                                            11.

9    EXT. OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY                             9

     The Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the
     mule must face him. They are in the midst of an argument.

                             THE POSTMAN
               It's true, we haven't done this in
               a while, but it's like riding a
               bicycle. Now, open your mouth.

     The Postman pries his mouth open. Taking a toothbrush, he
     tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look.
     BILL BRAYS.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I know the rule. It's my rule!
               Avoid civilization at all costs.
               But we gotta eat, don't we?
                      (as BILL BRAYS again)
               What are you so worried about,
               Bill? All you gotta do is stand
               there. I'm the one with all the
               lines.

     The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town
     far below. Making his case all the while -- even as BILL
     BRAYS in protest.


10   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY                            10

     A patch of mud. In the center of the square fifty
     townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman
     wraps up a performance of MacBeth. He plays it with a
     mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. Children
     especially are enamored. A heavily-muscled man, WOODY,
     lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman
     with inscrutable intensity.

                             THE POSTMAN
               They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth,
               'til Birnam Wood comes to
               Dunsinane'!

     He looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I said, Birnam Wood comes to
               Dunsinane!

     Bill trots on-stage. Covered with twigs, BILL is Birnam
     Wood. He BRAYS lustily. The audience laughs in delight.
     The children clap. Only Woody seems unaffected.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              12.

     The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going
     well.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Arm, arm yourselves! If the
                  witch's words are true, there'll
                  be no running or hiding here!

     Shaking off the twigs, Bill takes one of the swords in his
     mouth. The two of them dash back and forth pretending to
     fight off an imaginary attack. Finally, The Postman looks
     out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the
                  day after that. Out brief candle!
                  Life's but a walking shadow, a
                  poor player that struts his hour
                  upon the stage and is heard no
                  more. It's a tale told by a
                  moron. Full of sound and fury,
                  signifying nothing.
                         (waves sword)
                  But blow, wind! Come wrack! At
                  least we'll die with the harness
                  off our back!

     The audience erupts in applause. But Woody stands still
     as stone. The Postman takes a bow. Even Bill does a
     cross-legged dip. Knowing when to quit, he steps off the
     stage to many hearty handshakes.

     Woody watches his every move. MRS. THOMPSON, one of the
     town's leaders, steps up. She's accompanied by crotchety
     old CURMUDGEON LARRY.

                                MRS. THOMPSON
                  The children have never heard
                  Shakespeare before.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (grinning)
                  They still haven't.

     The Curmudgeon is still clapping.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks.   You're very nice.

                                CURMUDGEON LARRY
                  I'm clapping because you stink.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I don't think you understand how
                  it works.

                                CURMUDGEON LARRY
                  When I was young, I tried to be an
                  actor. I was awful. But now I
                  won't die thinking I was the worst
                  one.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm glad I could help.

                                MRS. THOMPSON
                  Larry, stop it.
                         (to The Postman)
                  You were very good.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Good enough to get something to
                  eat?

     Before she can answer, a SENTRY cries...

                                 SENTRY
                  Holnists!   Holnists are coming!

     All eyes look down the road leading into town. A raiding
     party of Holnist Cavalry are on their way in. Mrs.
     Thompson sees The Postman's concern.

                               MRS. THOMPSON
                  It's okay. We give them food and
                  supplies. All the towns do.

                                MAN #1
                  They hardly kill anyone lately.
                  Just take a woman sometimes.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Well, I'd just as soon not give
                  them anything of mine. Let's find
                  the back door, Bill.

     The Postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto Bill.

     The forty Holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in.
     They're armed with mostly pistols and rifles. Some carry
     bows, knives, spear guns and swords. On their bare
     shoulders, branded into the flesh -- the number "8."

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Out front, always leading by example is, GENERAL
     BETHLEHEM. Tough, smart, merciless with style. Commander
     of the United Clans of Holn. Nothing escapes his eye.

     A little behind him is the mysteriously silent Colonel
     Getty, second in command.

     The Postman, finished packing, begins to move from
     building to building -- careful not to attract any
     attention.

                                BETHLEHEM (O.S.)
                  What are you doing there?

     The Postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find
     Bethlehem's not talking to him at all. The General looks
     down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game
     of "Birnam Wood."

     The children stop, stare at their feet. Bethlehem affects
     a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I said, what are you doing?

     Meantime, The Postman continues his surreptitious escape.
     The MAYOR hurries forward to greet Bethlehem.

                                MAYOR
                  It's just a game, General
                  Bethlehem. Something they saw in
                  a play. No harm in it.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  A play?
                         (to kids)
                  Show me. It's all right,
                  children, show me.

     One BRAVE BOY finds his voice, barely.

                                BRAVE BOY
                  Arm, arm yourselves! No running
                  from the witches!

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (surprised)
                  Shakespeare, is it? Well, I'm
                  sorry I missed it.

                                MAYOR
                  You should know, sir, we haven't
                  nearly stocked the game we thought
                  we would.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Really?   But you had time for a
                  play?

     Head down, The Postman makes for "the back way." But it's
     guarded by three daunting Holnist soldiers. No getting by
     them. The Postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he
     came.

     Bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I'm taking three conscripts from
                  each town. They will have the
                  honor of serving in the Holnist
                  Army until such time as I see fit.
                         (to Mayor)
                  Three men. You suppose you could
                  do that?

     The Mayor nods in acquiescence. Bethlehem looks to a
     Holnist officer. The officer, IDAHO, steps up and
     addresses the town.

                                IDAHO
                  All men between 15 and 50 and of
                  suitable ethnic foundation are
                  required to show themselves now.

     The Holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or
     unwilling candidates forward.

     The Postman is now walking behind Bethlehem. Some of the
     Townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way
     toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of
     town.

     Three conscripts are hustled before Bethlehem. He looks
     over the first -- Woody. Smells him. Not much of a
     decision here.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Acceptable.

                                 IDAHO
                  Sir?

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Acceptable, Captain!

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               16.

     The second -- a thin teenager. Bethlehem feels his arm,
     turns his head from side to side.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You'll need to put some meat on,
                  but I like an impressionable mind.
                  Acceptable.

     The third -- an innocuous man. Or so we think. Bethlehem
     stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the
     bump on the man's nose.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Mongoloid.   Unacceptable.

     Soldiers shove the man back into the crowd. The Brave Boy
     that was playing Birnam Wood allows himself a tiny smile
     when he sees that The Postman might make it.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I want pure blood. Someone
                  like...

     Bethlehem notes the Boy, turns to see the object of his
     attention, and spots The Postman leaving out the front
     gate.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  That man.

     Idaho and another soldier are on it. The Postman tries to
     back away as the two dismount and come toward him.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You don't understand...

     But Idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for
     explanations -- they grab him.

                                IDAHO
                  You were required to show
                  yourself.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  But, I'm not with these people.
                  I'm just passing through. I --

     Idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head.
     Everything falls OUT OF FOCUS

                                   IDAHO (O.S.)
                  Take the mule.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

11   EXT. HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAY             11

     Spread out in the valley is General Bethlehem's Holnist
     Expeditionary Force. A five hundred-man army enjoying all
     the comforts a bivouac can offer.

     19 head-shaved CONSCRIPTS, including Woody and The
     Postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen. They
     watch as three more are shoved inside. One of them is
     Bandit #20. He and The Postman come face to face,
     recognize each other.

                              BANDIT #20
               Hi.

                             THE POSTMAN
                      (astonished)
               Hi?

     The Postman steps toward him, Bandit #20 backs off
     quickly.

                             BANDIT #20
               Well... I mean, we know each
               other, kind of...

                              THE POSTMAN
               Kind of.

                             BANDIT #20
                      (looking around)
               Wow!

                             THE POSTMAN
               So what did you guys do with my
               cigarettes?

                             BANDIT #20
               We traded them for a woman.

                              THE POSTMAN
               Wonderful.   What happened to your
               partners?

                             BANDIT #20
               They traded me to the Holnists.

                              GUARD (O.S.)
               Ten hut!

     General Bethlehem approaches on horseback. Colonel Getty
     follows behind. Bethlehem looks his new recruits over.
     Dismounting, he enters the pen and walks among them.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Welcome, gentlemen, to your new
                  life. You have been born again as
                  soldiers in the army of the United
                  Clans of Holn. The strong have
                  been sapped by the whimpering
                  propaganda of the weak. Men,
                  strong men, have been denied their
                  destiny. You men have been saved
                  from that fate. Redemption is
                  within your grasp.

     He starts down the line, looking the men over. He stops
     in front of a GANGLY RECRUIT. The Postman is alongside.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You. What did you do before you
                  were given this opportunity?

                                GANGLY RECRUIT
                  I had a shovel. I digged holes.

     Bethlehem regards him benevolently.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You digged holes... Well, now
                  you're going to fill them.
                         (turns to Postman)
                  And you?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Me?

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Is there any question in anyone's
                  mind that I was talking to you?
                  Yes, you. You look like a
                  dangerous man. Are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm just a performer.
                  Shakespeare. Stuff like that.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Shakespeare?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  He was a writer. He --

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry
                  "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of
                  war.'

     Bethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to
     clap for him. He looks at The Postman expectantly.
     Finally...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I, um, you want a line?

     Bethlehem nods.     The Postman thinks a moment...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  'To be or not to be: That is the
                  question.'

     Bethlehem looks at his men as if to say, "Is this all this
     guy's got?" Bethlehem eyes The Postman; he wants a
     contest.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  'We few, we happy few, we band of
                  brothers.'

     The Holnists clap, they know their General can best this
     guy.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (gaining confidence)
                  'Now is the winter of our
                  discontent made glorious summer by
                  this son of York.'

     Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You're pretty good. You're also a
                  fighter. I see it in your eyes.

     The Postman doesn't answer. Hesitant, he doesn't want to
     get into any more trouble than he's already in.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Don't you agree? Come on, a man's
                  got to speak his mind.

     Bethlehem sounds sincere.    He seems like a good guy.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I don't mean any disrespect, sir,
                  but you'd be better off just
                  letting me go. A fighter is about
                  the last thing I am.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                20.

     The Postman doubles over as Bethlehem hooks a fist into
     his gut. Bethlehem clubs him in the head, dropping him to
     his knees, then digs a boot into his side. The Postman
     goes down.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Don't you think I should be the
                  judge of that, soldier?

     The Postman gasps to catch his breath.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Get up.   I said, get up.

     The Postman staggers to his feet. Blood trickles from his
     nose as he stares across at Bethlehem.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Put up your fists.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  You'd win.

     Bethlehem looks to Getty. CLICK. Getty shoves a PISTOL
     is into The Postman's ear. The Postman reluctantly raises
     his fists. Bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Now fight.

     The Postman takes a tentative step forward. Bethlehem
     drives him back with a flurry of blows. The Postman is
     dazed, nearly out on his feet. Bethlehem holds him up.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You're right. You're not a
                  fighter. But you will be. I'm
                  giving you a chance at a life that
                  means something. A life worth
                  living.

     That said, Bethlehem delivers one last blow to The
     Postman's face. Everything goes BLACK...


12   EXT. HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAWN                12

     A brutal REVEILLE BLASTS the sleeping conscripts awake.

                                   IDAHO (O.S.)
                  Let's move it.     Everybody up and

     The Postman comes to. He licks his dry, blood-caked lips.
     A sudden movement startles him -- it's Woody, shoving him
     a battered cup of water. It's like he's been keeping
     watch. The Postman is surprised, a little suspicious, and
     very grateful as he gulps the water down.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks.   Did I win?

     Woody shakes his head "no."

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I tried to tell him...

                                  WOODY
                  Say it again.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Say what?

                                WOODY
                  The words you said in town. About
                  the wind blowing. And the rest...
                  Say it again.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  'Blow, wind. Come wrack. At
                  least we'll die with the harness
                  off our back.'

                                WOODY
                  What's it mean?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Live free or die.

     Woody and The Postman scramble to fall-to with the other
     conscripts. Idaho surveys the ranks.

                                IDAHO
                  All right, girls. We're gonna
                  run. Twenty miles. With packs.
                  You got three hours. Everybody
                  makes it. Or nobody eats.


13   EXT. TRAINING CAMP - MESS LINE - CLOSE ON MEAT - DAY           13

     A COOK dumps a scoop of gristly, gray meat into each mess
     pail as the conscripts wait in line. They fall to
     ravenously, too hungry to taste how bad it is. Idaho
     supervises.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  Eat up!    You got meat tonight.

     The line has almost passed. Just The Postman left and
     Bandit #20 bringing up the rear. Idaho looks at The
     Postman, addresses the COOK.

                                IDAHO
                  Why don't you tell Shakespeare
                  what kind of meat that is.

                                  COOK
                  Mule.

     Probably Bill -- and The Postman knows it. He stares in
     revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail.

                                IDAHO
                  A godawful animal. The sterile
                  offspring of a horse and a donkey.
                  Can you imagine that?! There's no
                  room in this new world for a
                  bastard like that.

     Bandit #20 holds out his pail.       But the cook won't fill
     it.

                                  IDAHO
                  Uh uh.
                         (loudly; for all)
                  Any man last in line ain't hungry
                  enough. You show up last, you
                  don't eat!

     Bandit #20 steps away in disbelief. Not knowing what else
     to do, he sits down beside The Postman, the only man with
     food who isn't eating.

                                BANDIT #20
                  I'll die before I'm last in line
                  again.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  That's what they're hoping for.

     He holds his pail out to Bandit #20.

                                 BANDIT #20
                  Serious?   This isn't bad.

     Lost in despair, The Postman stares out at the skewed
     palette.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  These were supposed to be the best
                  years of my life.

14   EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY                                  14

     The conscripts stand at attention under the guard of Idaho
     and two other soldiers. To their right is a dead oak
     tree. Behind them, three rows of folding chairs.

     Two figures approach. Bethlehem and Getty. Getty carries
     a sheathed sword. Bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking
     no more notice of The Postman than anyone else.

                             BETHLEHEM
               The laws of eight, gentlemen.
               That is the legacy handed down to
               us by Nathan Holn.

     At the mention of this name, the RECRUITS shout as one.

                             RECRUITS
               God rest his soul!

                             THE POSTMAN

               May he burn in hell.

     Getty looks over at him. He heard him. The Postman
     swallows hard. Getty stares hard. Then he turns away.
     He's not going to bust him on it.

                             BETHLEHEM
               These are the laws that we live
               by. The eight is our symbol.
               Each man will bear it with pride.

     Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to
     reveal the branded 8.

                             BETHLEHEM
               Only then will you be part of the
               clan. Sit down, gentlemen.

     The men move to sit in one of the three rows. Only then
     does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17
     chairs. One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing. It doesn't
     take him long to realize that he's in trouble.

                             BETHLEHEM
               Law One. You will obey orders
               without question.
                      (to Slow Recruit)
               I told you to sit.

                             SLOW RECRUIT
                      (scared)
               There weren't enough chairs.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                 24.

14   CONTINUED:                                                        14

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I didn't specify chairs. You
                  could've sat down on the ground.

     The Slow Recruit moves to do so.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  You disobeyed a direct order.    You
                  broke Law One.

     Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Law Two.   Punishment shall be
                  swift.

     They hustle the Recruit to the tree. Idaho unslings a
     coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. They quickly
     slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him
     upside down into the air.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Law Three: Mercy is for the weak.
                  Four: Terror will defeat reason.
                  Five: Your allegiance is to the
                  clan. Six: Justice can be
                  dictated. Law Seven. Any
                  clansman may challenge for
                  leadership of the clan. Does any
                  man here wish to challenge me?

     There are no takers.

                                  BETHLEHEM
                  On your feet!

     The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open.

     Without a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out
     and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds.
     Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists
     around.

                               BETHLEHEM
                  Law Eight: There is only one
                  penalty: Death.

     Bethlehem raises the sword.

                                SLOW RECRUIT
                  Please, I'm begging you.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                                 25.

     THE POSTMAN

     As the sword finds its mark.     Bethlehem looks at him, but
     addresses all.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You will get out of this army what
                  you put into it. Work and you'll
                  be fed. Fight and you'll be
                  respected. Die and you'll be
                  remembered. It's up to you.

     Bethlehem turns and walks away.     Getty following behind.
     The Postman watches as they go.     Idaho steps up to him.

                                IDAHO
                  You thinking of challenging for
                  leadership of the clan?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  No, sir.   I'm a follower not a
                  leader.

                                IDAHO
                  You see Colonel Getty? Always
                  following the General? He's the
                  only man who ever challenged.
                  Fight lasted six seconds, but the
                  General didn't kill him. He cut
                  off his tongue and he cut off his
                  balls and old Getty's been
                  following him like a dog ever
                  since.

     The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty
     disappear into the gloom. Idaho grins, likes how this
     affects a new man.

     The Postman moves on.     Idaho stops Woody as he passes.

                                IDAHO
                  The General don't see it, but I
                  say you got some nigger in you.

     Woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer.


15   EXT. PLAINS - DAY                                                 15

     Rain as the army moves. Boots suck at the mud. War
     wagons heave out of ruts. A monster gun is mounted on an
     old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. The
     conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy
     pack.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Marching beside Woody, The Postman stares blankly ahead.
     The cry to halt. The conscripts unsling their packs,
     catch their breath. Idaho pulls The Postman out of line.

                                IDAHO
                  The General would like a word with
                  you, Shakespeare.


16   INT. GENERAL BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAY                             16

     Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in
     hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his
     reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition
     of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure.

     He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in.
     Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman
     doesn't quite know what to do.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                         (re: the book and
                          binoculars on the
                          table)
                  They're yours. A solitary man,
                  aren't you? Binoculars. To watch
                  life from a distance. And
                  Shakespeare. To read about it
                  instead of living it.

     Bethlehem wants an answer.    The Postman clears his throat.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  No offense, General, but you seem
                  to have read some Shakespeare
                  yourself.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  If he wishes to rise above mere
                  thuggery, a military commandeer
                  must be classically educated.
                  Philosophy, history. Even a sense
                  of the dramatic.
                         (a beat)
                  Do you know what I did before the
                  war? Do you think I was in the
                  army? I sold copying machines. I
                  was a salesman. The talent to
                  lead men and devise and execute a
                  battle plan were locked away
                  inside me.

     He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn.     A 20-
     year-old self-help book.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  If Nathan Holn hadn't come along,
                  I'd still be selling copying
                  machines. Can you imagine the
                  wasted life? Can you imagine the
                  magnitude of it? But war... War
                  gives men like me a chance.

     He turns to a dog-eared page in the book.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Here... 'The prize is often left
                  unclaimed. Have the courage to
                  grasp it. For fortune always
                  favors the bold.'
                         (moved)
                  It always inspires me.
                         (beat)
                  I have a design for the future. A
                  master plan. I'll need able
                  officers to carry it out. You
                  have the intelligence. If your
                  heart matches, you'll go far.
                         (a beat)
                  We'll talk more in the weeks to
                  come. Dismissed.

     The Postman leaves.     Idaho stands at the ready.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Issue the binoculars to a scout.

                                IDAHO
                  And the book, sir?

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Burn it.

     Idaho leaves. Bethlehem goes back to his painting. He
     considers himself in the mirror. After a long stare-down,
     he shouts:

                                 BETHLEHEM
                  Quit moving.


17   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                17

     The Postman rejoins the conscripts. Bandit #20 slides
     over.

                                   BANDIT #20
                  What happened?

     Troubled, The Postman doesn't answer. He heads for a
     corner where Woody stands alone. Relentless, Bandit #20
     follows.

                                BANDIT #20
                  What did he say?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Nothing.

                                BANDIT #20
                  Did he say anything about me?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  No.

     They reach the quiet corner; it's just the three of them.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  We got to get out of here.

                                BANDIT #20
                  What are you talking about?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Escaping.
                         (low)
                  You ever hear of St. Rose? It's
                  on the coast. They say it's a
                  paradise. They've even got
                  electric lights.

     Bandit #20 looks scared, Woody unreadable.

                                   BANDIT #20
                  We can't.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Between the three of us, we
                  could --

                                BANDIT #20
                  No, no. I can't. I like it here.
                  I like being a part of something.

     The Postman can't believe what Bandit #20 just said.
     Bandit #20 turns, hurries away.

     The Postman looks to Woody who doesn't tip his hand either
     way. He moves away as well.

                                                                29.

18   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                  18

     The conscripts break camp. Hot work. Glistening with
     sweat, The Postman stops to stretch. Across the way, he
     sees Bandit #20 talking to Getty. Getty glances at The
     Postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as
     Idaho joins the group. There's trouble brewing here.

     Worried, The Postman looks to Woody, who watches the
     exchange as well. He is, as usual, inscrutable.


19   EXT. CLEARING - RIVER - DAY                                      19

     The river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw.
     Marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given
     the order to halt.

     The Postman looks ahead to where Idaho confers with
     Bethlehem. Something's wrong. They look to where:

     Two carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a
     thicket across the river. A rotten wood and rope bridge
     spans the space between the ridges.

     Idaho rides to the conscripts:

                             IDAHO
               One of you dogs has earned himself
               a treat. Over there.

     Idaho points to the thicket as he proceeds down the line.

                             IDAHO
               Those men hunted themselves a lion
               this morning. Must've been a zoo
               around here before the war.
               Anyhow, they shot him and he
               crawled into that thicket. A
               third man went in after him. We
               don't know if he's dead or alive.
               I need a volunteer. Someone's
               gotta go in and get our boy out.

     No volunteers, except the zealot Bandit #20.

                               BANDIT #20
               I'll go.

     Idaho ignores him, stops in front of Woody.

                             IDAHO
               I guess size ain't a measure of
               courage, is it? Shakespeare!

     The fix is in.    The Postman steps out of line.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              30.

19   CONTINUED:                                                     19

     Idaho's about to hand The Postman a carbine when --

                                BETHLEHEM (O.S.)
                  I don't think so, Captain.

     Bethlehem nods to Getty. Getty takes a hunting knife from
     a belt-sheath and tosses it, blade first, into the ground
     between The Postman's feet.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Come out alive and you got
                  yourself a lion steak.

     Hefting the knife, The Postman stares at the west ridge.

                                 IDAHO
                         (winks)
                  Maybe you'll find your St. Rose up
                  there.

     The Postman looks to Bandit #20 who stares back defiantly.

                                IDAHO
                  What are you waiting for,
                  Christmas?

     Bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands
     the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman.

     Grim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten
     bridge to the water and back again as he moves.

     All eyes on him as he starts across...


20   EXT. BRIDGE - DAY                                              20

     The Postman steps lightly. Far below, the river rages. A
     knotty plank starts to crack underfoot. Scooting off it,
     he takes a last look around. Continues across to...


21   EXT. WEST RIDGE - DAY                                          21

     The soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly
     mugs. They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a
     trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket.

     Stooping, The Postman enters. The soldiers split off and
     track along with him on either side of the thicket.

                                                               31.

22   EXT. THICKET - DAY                                              22

     Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes
     his way through. He freezes. Ahead, sprawled and
     twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier.

                               SOLDIER (O.S.)
                 Why are you stopping?

                                  THE POSTMAN
                 I found him.

                                  SOLDIER (O.S.)
                 He alive?

     Clearly he is not.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                 Yeah.

                                  SOLDIER (O.S.)
                 Bring him out.

     The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back. Rising,
     steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a
     GUTTURAL GROWL. He hurries forward.


     ARMY

     Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The
     Postman emerges with the corpse on his back.


     ON BRIDGE

     The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden.   He
     pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank.

                               IDAHO
                        (across river)
                 Hurry up! You still got a lion to
                 bag!

     The Postman decides, deliberately steps on the PLANK.
     CRACK. The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down,
     disappear in the river below.

     The corpse surfaces first, floats in the water.

     Then The Postman. Farther down the river. Swimming
     downstream with powerful strokes. Between his efforts and
     the current, he's being quickly swept away from the
     Holnists.

     As Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              32.

22   CONTINUED:                                                     22

     A RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman, but he
     disappears around a bend in the river.

     Bethlehem signals to two soldiers. They start running
     along the east ridge toward the riverbend.

     Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving
     with military precision.

     Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  In the water. Come back without
                  him and you and another man will
                  die in his place.

     Woody dives in the water. Bethlehem looks to Idaho who
     dives in as well. Conscripts buzz with nervous
     excitement.

                                CONSCRIPTS
                  Go!   Go!

                                BANDIT #20
                         (caught up)
                  I'll get him, sir.

     He takes off running across the bridge.


23   EXT. RIVER - DAY                                               23

     A fallen tree spans the river. As The Postman is swept
     beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. Pulling himself
     out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He
     disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear.

     They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see
     footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself
     out. They start after him.


24   EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY                                    24

     Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman
     stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past.

     Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the
     clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the
     trees. They look at each other for a moment.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Just let me go. I don't want to
                  be part of your army.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             33.

24   CONTINUED:                                                    24

     Bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a
     grin.

                                 BANDIT #20
                  My army.   I like the sound of
                  that.

     The Postman gestures with his knife.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Don't --

                                 BANDIT #20
                  I got him!   Over --

     The Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut.   He blinks
     in surprise, then sags to the ground.

     The Postman takes a step back. A shadow falls over him.
     It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear
     others approaching from the river.

                                WOODY
                  They sent me to kill you.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Come with me.

     At that moment, Idaho and the second soldier come into the
     clearing. Idaho grins, relaxes his grip on his gun when
     he sees the mismatch between Woody and The Postman.

                                 IDAHO
                  Good, boy.   Get him.

                                WOODY
                  It's you or me.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  I know.

                                  IDAHO
                  Finish it.

     Woody circles The Postman, until he's facing Idaho and the
     soldier. Woody takes a long look at The Postman, smiles.

                                WOODY
                  No harness on my back.

     As The Postman realizes what he's doing, Woody flips his
     knife through the air and into the soldier's throat.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             34.

     As Woody rushes him, Idaho raises his GUN.

     Idaho pumps TWO ROUNDS into Woody, but the big man keeps
     coming. The THIRD ROUND finds his heart, puts Woody down.
     Dead. But not before he lands on top of Idaho.

     As Idaho struggles to get out from under Woody's massive
     frame, The Postman heads for the trees.


     Covered in Woody's blood, Idaho FIRES a ROUND as The
     Postman disappears into the woods. Idaho starts after
     him.


     IDAHO

     Tracking. He sees a dribble of fresh blood.   He touches
     it with his fingers and smiles.

     He cocks his head at MOVEMENT to his left. Smiling,
     hefting his pistol, Idaho moves in. More SHUFFLING.   Just
     ahead. He's got him now.

                                IDAHO
                  You want your St. Rose?

     There's a RUSTLE of BRUSH just before a ROAR splits the
     air. Idaho doesn't even have time to scream as the LION
     pounces down on top of him.


25   EXT. CLIFF - DAY                                              25

     The Postman, lungs heaving, stops his climb long enough to
     take stock of the Army waiting on the distant river edge.

     Strength ebbing, he heaves himself up and continues
     climbing.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


26   EXT. WOODS (EASTERN OREGON) - NIGHT                           26

     A chilling RAIN drills down, washing across an old forest
     road. Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings,
     nothing's been down here in years.

     Blue-lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked,
     The Postman trudges along. He tries to rub some warmth
     back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks
     his body.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               35.

26   CONTINUED:                                                      26

     He trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. He's
     made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't
     find some shelter.

     An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road.    Square.   He
     cautiously pulls back a few branches.

     An old, rusted Jeep with faded    U.S. government markings.
     Its hood buried under the dirt    of an old mud slide. The
     Postman stoops to look through    the passenger side window,
     comes face-to-face with death.     A skeleton sits inside,
     the skull grinning against the    glass facing The Postman.


     But The Postman doesn't jump back. He just stares. The
     two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected
     on the glass, superimposed over the skull.

     A hypothermic shiver wracks his body. The Postman tries
     the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep
     is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly
     smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider-
     webbed safety glass and climbs inside.


     JEEP

     Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the
     skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first
     time.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Hey.   How ya doin'?

     The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked U.S. Mail.
     The Postman picks up a hat off the console. Oddly
     respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the
     "Horse & Rider" emblem.

     The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag
     patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver.
     A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket
     off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside.

     A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a
     liquor. He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have"
     look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs
     the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He
     takes a long, hard swallow. The warming fire streams down
     his throat.

     The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            36.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  'Jerry Ball, Pine View.'

     He starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  So, arrest me.
                         (reading)
                  Here's a piece of good news.
                  Jerry's decided to go to school to
                  get his contractor's license.

     Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another.   The
     words are in crayon -- a child's scrawl.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles to skeleton)
                  Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to
                  know he lost a tooth.

     The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm. A tiny
     tooth falls out. The Postman considers it. This suddenly
     isn't so amusing. He puts it back in the envelope.

     Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back.
     Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself
     with a blanket of mail. Getting warmer already, he
     regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF.


27   EXT. JEEP - DAY                                              27

     Wearing the blue uniform, The Postman looks down at the
     fresh grave, realizes a eulogy is in order. He takes off
     the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of
     silence.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks for being there for me.
                         (raising the flask)
                  Here's to you. I consider my
                  taxes very well spent.

     He swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down
     as a headstone. What now?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  All dressed up. Nowhere to go.

                                                               37.

28   EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY                  28

     His hair growing back nicely, The Postman has reached the
     proverbial fork in the road. He considers his two
     options: "Pine View -- 32 miles." Or "Ridgemont -- 220
     miles." He looks the two roads over, thinks.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Well, that's easy.


29   EXT. GATES (PINE VIEW, OREGON) - DUSK                           29

     The town is protected by a tall, long palisade.     Like Ft.
     Apache. All is dark as The Postman approaches.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Greetings, Pine View, Oregon!

     TWO SENTRIES appears from the gate house.    They aim
     arrows.

                                SENTRY #1
                  Just head back the way you came.
                  Pine View ain't buying, ain't
                  listening and don't give charity.

     A moment of truth is here.    Finally, with authority:

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Civilian, I'm on official
                  business. I demand entry into the
                  town of Pine View.

                                SENTRY #2
                  What the hell are you talking
                  about?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm through talking to you, buddy
                  boy! Now get somebody with
                  authority to open this gate!

     More silhouettes appear on the palisade.     One is SHERIFF
     BRISCOE, a big, no-nonsense man.

                                BRISCOE
                  I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell
                  are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm a representative of the United
                  States Government --

     An uproar.    He makes himself heard above it.

                  lower Oregon. Now open that damn
                  gate!

                                BRISCOE
                  What does that mean in English?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm your postman!

     There's a silent hush.

                         (to someone on wall)
                  Hand me your gun.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Understand that tampering with or
                  obstructing the mail is a federal
                  offense. Furthermore, the Bolin
                  Act requires you to provide all
                  mail carriers with sanctuary and
                  nourishment.
                         (starting forward)
                  Now open that damn gate!

                                BRISCOE
                  You got three seconds to get your
                  ass outta here.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Is Jerry the contractor here?

     Briscoe pumps his shotgun, aims it at The Postman.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Wait! I'm going to get something
                  out of my bag.

     The Postman dumps the pack over, frantically shuffles
     through the letters.

                                 BRISCOE
                  One!

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Paul Davis!   124 Vernon Street!

                                BRISCOE
                  Never heard of him. Two!

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                39.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Lois Kent!   14 Weymoth Lane!

                                 BRISCOE
                  Three!

     He fumbles for the last letter.       Briscoe takes aim.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Irene March!   478 River Road!

     There's an absolute stunned silence.      Like a switch was
     thrown.


30   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                          30

     The crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at IRENE
     MARCH. Mrs. March, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes
     clouded by cataracts. In disbelief...

                                MRS. MARCH
                  Did he say my name?

     The sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back.
     Two TOWNIES hurry Mrs. March out to meet The Postman.
     They're followed by a throng. As he sees she's blind...

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Oh, no...

     Too late now. They stop Mrs. March in front of him.        She
     stares off just to his left, a little afraid.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  I'm Irene March.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (uncomfortable)
                  I have a letter for you.

     He presses it into her hands, but she won't take it.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  Would you read it?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm sure it's personal.

                                 MRS. MARCH
                  Please.   Someone has to.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                 40.

30   CONTINUED:                                                         30

     The Postman has little choice.     As he opens the
     envelope...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  We're delivering the old stock
                  piles, but I'll accept all new
                  correspondence as well.

                                TOWNIE
                  Just read it, will ya?

     Excited, the people move closer.      Someone holds up a torch
     and The Postman starts.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  'Dear Irene. Sorry I haven't
                  written. Everything's so crazy.
                  The strange weather. The food
                  shortages. That farmer Nathan
                  Holn causing all that trouble.
                  It's hard to understand. David's
                  home from the Army. The war was
                  over before he even got there.
                  Thank God for that. He's still my
                  baby no matter how big he gets.
                  We're going to miss you for
                  Christmas, but maybe next year.
                  All our love. Donna.'

     Mrs. March reaches out a trembling hand to take the
     letter.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  My sister in Denver. Fifteen
                  years ago. Thank you.

     The populace erupts with excitement.        Mrs. March takes The
     Postman's hand, clasps it tightly.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  You're a Godsend. A savior.

     The Postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  No.   I'm just... a postman.

     An almost awesome silence.     Too much for The Postman.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I've been on the road a while. I
                  could use a little something to
                  eat --

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                             41.

30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             30

                                 MRS. MARCH
                  Oh, yes, absolutely... Is there
                  anything else?

     The townspeople welcome him with cheers. The Postman
     raises a silencing hand. As they quiet...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Yes, there is! If there are dogs
                  in this town, you have to leash
                  them while I'm here!

     Only The Postman laughs. No one else reacts. Briscoe
     watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround The
     Postman and sweep him through the gates and into town.

     One couple watches The Postman closely as he makes his way
     into town. She is ABBY -- a sweet-faced, pretty woman.
     Her husband, MICHAEL, is a decent-looking sort, tall and
     strong.


31   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                         31

     A freestanding tub has been set up, water "bucketed" in.
     The Postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and
     sings a familiar tune to himself.

                               THE POSTMAN
                  'Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute,
                  Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr.
                  Postman...'


32   EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                          32

     FORD crosses the parking lot of an abandoned motel. He's
     a black kid, maybe 16, too young to remember any other
     life but this. He carries The Postman's uniform on a
     hanger.


33   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                         33

     The Postman looks up at a KNOCK. Ford steps in. Like
     most kids, he needs a hero. Holding up the uniform, he
     just found one.

                                FORD
                         (beaming)
                  Cleaned and pressed, sir.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               42.

33   CONTINUED:                                                      33

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks. Didn't somebody say
                  something about dinner?

                                FORD
                  Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to
                  Foster's.
                         (extending a hand)
                  My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln
                  Mercury.

     The Postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and
     hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself.

                                FORD
                  Used to be John Stevens, but I
                  changed it on account of I want to
                  drive cars.

     Hoping to impress, Ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a
     worn, creased flyer for a "Ford Lincoln Mercury"
     dealership. Ford finds The Postman just staring at him,
     waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand.
     Embarrassed, Ford quickly hands it over.


34   EXT. STREET (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                                 34

     Ford leads the way as they leave the motel behind. The
     Postman looks good in his uniform. They cross a parking
     lot where five partly-stripped cars have been sitting for
     years. There's a potted plant outside the driver's door
     of one.

                                FORD
                  I live in that car. A 2003
                  Pontiac Sinatra. With a nine-
                  banger and a Q-eight.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  V-eight. Eight cylinders.   That
                  means an eight-banger.

                                FORD
                         (in awe of him)
                  Were they fast?

                                FORD
                  A buck seventy-five on a strip.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                  43.

34   CONTINUED:                                                         34

                                FORD
                  A buck seventy-five? I thought
                  maybe I could fix some of them up.
                  It's nothing compared to what you
                  do.

     This is the last thing he expected to hear out of this
     kid's mouth. A moment, then...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The important thing to remember
                  about cars is, you can't eat 'em.

     Ahead, people are gathered inside an old Foster's Freeze.


35   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           35

     The townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. They
     talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous
     applause as Ford and The Postman enter.

     The Postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display.
     But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the
     counter. The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew.

     The PEOPLE clear a path for him.

                                MAN #1
                  Tell us about the government!

                                WOMAN #1
                  Yes, tell us everything!

     Startled, The Postman doesn't quite know what to say.
     They seat him at a table -- but the food looks miles away.

                                MAN #2
                  Is there a President?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Yeah.

                                WOMAN #2
                  What's his name?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You know, I'm pretty hungry.

     But these people won't be denied.       Finally...

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                44.

35   CONTINUED:                                                       35

                                THE POSTMAN
                  His name is, uh... Richard
                  Starkey. From Maine. He has a
                  saying. 'Things are getting
                  better, getting better all the
                  time.'

     There's warm applause at that.    Several people try the
     expression out on each other.

                                MAN #3
                  He a Democrat or a Republican?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Parties are over with. The
                  individual is what counts. You
                  vote for the best man.

     Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The
     Postman. Famished, he digs in.

                                MAN #4
                  What about Europe? Any word?

     The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years
                  old and she still kicks ass.

                                WOMAN #3
                  Is Nathan Holn still alive?

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles at irony)
                  He died. Skin cancer.

     That's sure good news to everyone.       But...

                                WOMAN #4
                  And the Holnists? They're still
                  out there. What's the government
                  going to do about them?

     The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather
     get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important
     question of all. He doesn't want to lie.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The government's just getting
                  started. You're on your own for
                  at least eighteen months.

                  What about the Marines Corp?

     A clamor of Holnist questions.

                                ELLEN
                  Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just
                  let this man eat?

     The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He

     After a moment, Briscoe leaves.


36   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - LATER                                   36

     A band plays an odd array of instruments. There's
     dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls.
     People watch him eat like it was a religious experience.
     He pushes back the fifth bowl.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Never thought I'd hear myself say
                  this, but I can't eat anymore.

     He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.    The
     kid's looking up, staring intently at something.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  What?

     The boy just stares.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                          (re:   the cap)
                  This?

     The boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to
     himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  Almost fits.

     The boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up
     1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends,
     ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him.

                                ELLEN
                  That's not a toy, honey. That's
                  very important. Give it back.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                   46.

     The boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The
     Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her
     son away.

     The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman
     we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman.

                                ABBY
                  Would you like to dance?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  I don't know if I can, I think I'm
                  still on duty.

     He laughs.    Abby says nothing.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  It's been a long time.

     Abby holds out her hand like a promise.

                                ABBY
                  All you got to do is hold on.


     DANCE FLOOR

     Abby and The Postman dance.          She keeps looking him over.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Is something wrong?

                                ABBY
                  How tall are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  About six feet.

                                   ABBY
                  Are you smart?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Smarter than some I guess.       Why?

                                 ABBY
                  Just wondering. Did you ever have
                  the bad mumps?

     The Postman smiles.    She's odd, but beautiful.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Never had the bad mumps.

                  Have you ever had herpes or
                  syphilis or anything like that?

     He shakes his head "no."    They continue to dance.

                                ABBY
                  So as far as you know, you have
                  good semen?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Is that a trick question?

                                ABBY
                  I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only
                  asking because I want you to make
                  me pregnant.

     Stunned, The Postman stops dancing.      Abby takes this
     moment to grab Michael.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (to himself)
                  It's got to be the uniform.

     Abby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly.

                                ABBY
                  This is my husband.    Michael.

     Michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip.
     The Postman doesn't know what to think.

                                ABBY
                  We've been trying to have a baby
                  for three years. We can't on
                  account of Michael had the bad
                  mumps when he was twelve. So we
                  need a body father. We could ask
                  a man here, but it could cause
                  trouble. I've seen it happen.
                  Things go okay until the woman
                  starts to show. Then it can be
                  bad. But you'll only be around
                  once in awhile with the mail.

     The Postman just stares at them.      Abby looks to Michael.

                                ABBY
                  He hasn't said 'no'.

                         (undaunted)
                  What do you say, mister?     You'd be
                  doing us a favor.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'll have to think about it.

     The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away,
     shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world.

     But no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby
     and Michael, he's running smack into another group of
     well-wishing TOWNIES. Mrs. March is among them. She's
     holding an envelope.

                                TOWNIE #1
                  Mrs. March wants to give you
                  something.
                         (to Mrs. March)
                  He's right here, Irene.

                                MRS. MARCH
                         (re: letter)
                  It's to my daughter Annie. She
                  left five years ago. She was only
                  fifteen. The last I heard, she
                  was living up north...

     The Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the
     faces around him, to Mrs. March. She looks blindly back.
     How can he lie to her?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Look, Mrs. March, you should know
                  that...

                                 MRS. MARCH
                  Know what?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Know that...

     But she stops him, grabs for his hand.

                                MRS. MARCH
                  I have a feeling about you. I
                  know you'll do what's right.

     Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd.
     She's left him with her letter and no choice at all.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I got to get out of here.

                                                              49.

37   EXT. PINE VIEW - NIGHT                                         37

     The Postman moves through town. The streets are deserted.
     He's got his pack on, his mailbag. He passes a 7-11
     converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered
     to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going
     to make it out of here after all. As he starts to move
     toward the horse...

                                OLD MAN (O.S.)
                  It's right around the corner.

     An OLD MAN sits on his porch across the street.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (freezes, startled)
                  What is?

                                OLD MAN
                  What you're looking for.

     The Old Man winks knowingly, then heads inside. As The
     Postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the
     post office. An old brick building. Chiseled in the
     granite facing: "UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. EST. 1884."


38   INT. POST OFFICE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           38

     Long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost
     holy feel. The Postman wanders in, stops to read the
     credo calligraphied on the wall. "Neither snow, nor
     rain..." He turns at a SOUND. Ford is here, leaning
     against a wall.

                                FORD
                  I knew you'd come here.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                  You did, huh?

     Ford nods.    A sage sixteen-year-old.

                                FORD
                  How do you get to be a postman,
                  anyhow?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You have to be in the right place
                  at the right time.

                                FORD
                  How could I do it?

                  I thought you wanted to drive
                  cars.

                                FORD
                  Not anymore. That was kid's
                  stuff. This is real. So, where's
                  the right place?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only
                  another postman can make you a
                  postman.

                                FORD
                  Kinda like vampires, right?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Something like that. You have to
                  be sworn in.

     Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the
     oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The organization's kinda shaky.
                  It might not last.

                                FORD
                  What does?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You'd meet a lot of people who
                  don't believe in you.

                                FORD
                  I'll set them straight.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  It's a lonely job.

                                FORD
                  I've been lonely all my life.

     This response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly
     Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  So have I, Ford. So have I.

     The Postman looks up at the creed on the wall.    Finally...

                  Congratulations, you're a postman.

     They shake hands. The Postman doesn't realize, but this
     is the most important moment in Ford's life.

                                FORD
                  I want you to know I'd die to get
                  a letter through.

     Ford's intensity takes The Postman back.       But the moment
     is broken when...

                                BRISCOE (O.S.)
                  Johnny, why don't you run along.

                  I'll see you around.

     Ford exits.

                  Johnny's real impressed with you.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What can I do for you, Sheriff?

                                BRISCOE
                  You can clear out. Or I can throw
                  you out. Either way suits me
                  fine.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'm afraid you don't understand,
                  Sheriff. I'm a government
                  employee. Authorized by --

                                BRISCOE
                  You're not authorized by shit.
                  You're nothing but a drifter who
                  found a bag of mail. And I want
                  you out of my town.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  This is going in my report.

                                BRISCOE
                  These people don't need dreams,
                  Mr. Postman. They need something
                  real. They need help with the
                  goddamn Holnists. Are you going
                  to bring them that?
                         (as The Postman
                          doesn't answer)
                  Didn't think so. All you cost us
                  so far is a few bowls of soup and
                  maybe later a few broken hearts.
                  I aim to keep it that way. You
                  can stay till morning. Then I
                  don't ever want to see you again.

     Briscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post
     office.


39   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - NIGHT                          39

     The Postman arrives home. He pushes open the door,
     knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved
     under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them.
     They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on
     handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                53.

     They're brand new.      Shaking his head, he closes the door.

     The Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on
     the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs,
     smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's
     trapped in here.


40   EXT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - NIGHT                                     40

     CAMERA STARTS ON a man with a string-tied package crossing
     the streets and DRIFTS TO the abandoned car where Ford
     lives. He's home.


     ON FORD

     Concentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece
     of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post
     office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in.
     Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.

     PACKAGE - NIGHT

     ~from the previous scene.       It's on the table with a
     growing stack of mail.

     The Postman is in bed, trying to sleep. But it's hard-
     coming. He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up
     at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the
     door.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Just leave it.

     There's a pause.    And then, ANOTHER KNOCK.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I said leave it.

     The door opens. Surprise. Abby stands in the doorway,
     her hair held up by an old red ribbon. He sits up.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Hello, Abby.

                                ABBY
                  You'll be leaving tomorrow?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  I guess.

                         (enters; closes door)
                  Everybody's up late writing
                  letters for you to take. We're
                  not supposed to waste candles like
                  that, but they're so excited.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  How about you?     Do you have a
                  letter?

                                ABBY
                  I don't have anybody to write to.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I'll find you a pen pal. Someone
                  with interests similar to your
                  own. Dancing, checking for mumps.

     Abby laughs.    The Postman is charmed.

                                ABBY
                  You're funny. Hardly anyone's
                  funny around here.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I guess no one feels much like
                  laughing.

     The two of them just look at each other a moment.         Abby
     fingers the ribbon in her hair.

                                ABBY
                  Have you decided yet?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Oh, well, I've been thinking about
                  it.

     A beat. Abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then
     slides under the sheets alongside him.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Sure.   Why not?

     They lie there awkwardly for a moment.          He looks at her.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I
                  know you'd probably like to keep
                  things more clinical.
                         (beat)
                  You don't even know my name.

     She shushes him, covers his mouth with her hand.

                                ABBY
                  I don't want to.

     He nods he understands.     She stares into his eyes.

                                ABBY
                  It would be easier for me if you
                  closed your eyes.

     The Postman closes his eyes. Abby slides her hand away
     from his mouth. And as they start to make love...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


42   INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOM 7 - DAY                               42

     The Postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was
     there last night. But Abby is gone. All that's left
     behind is her red ribbon. Wistful, he picks it up.


43   EXT. ABANDONED HOTEL - DAY                                        43

     The Postman exits. In uniform, his bag slung over his
     shoulder. He starts then stops short. Only now do we see
     most of the townspeople have silently assembled here.
     They've been waiting for him, starving for him.

     Ford steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters.
     The Postman sees that Ford hangs on to four or five.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What about those?

                                FORD
                  These are going to Blue Jay.
                  About twenty miles east. I
                  thought I could take them.

     The Postman scans the crowd.      Looking for Abby maybe?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (absently)
                  Okay.   They're yours.

     Briscoe rides up, regards The Postman sternly.

                                BRISCOE
                  I'm your escort out of town.

     Some of the town's CITIZENS lead up a saddled mare.

                  We took a vote, Mr. Postman.   We
                  want you to have this horse.

                                CITIZEN #2
                  Now don't say no. A man on
                  horseback can cover ten times the
                  territory of a man on foot.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles at Briscoe)
                  I'll take it.

     He ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up.

                                CITIZEN #3
                  There's a bedroll, some oats and a
                  week's rations.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thank you.

                                CITIZEN #1
                  Where do you figure you'll go from
                  here?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Go?... Oh yeah... I'll head west,
                  then work my way back here in a
                  sort of figure eight.

     "8." Everyone's quiet a moment. They shift
     uncomfortably. The Postman looks out at the crowd. They
     crave hope. He should probably just keep his mouth shut.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Times seem hard right now. But
                  you have to believe it's getting
                  better. Birds are migrating
                  again. The rains are back.

     The people consider him and then each other. By God, they
     do feel hopeful. Suddenly, Ellen, her little boy by her
     side, begins to sing. It's weak at first, but one-by-one
     the others join in. Soon the whole town is singing:

                                ELLEN & TOWN
                  'Oh beautiful for spacious skies,
                  for amber waves of grain. For
                  purple mountain's majesty, above
                  the fruited plain. America...'

     The Postman looks around. They sing their hearts out.
     The guilt is overwhelming. He digs his heels into the
     horse's flanks and rides out of town.

                                                           57.

44   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY                        44

     People line the top as The Postman and Briscoe ride out.
     The strains of "AMERICA" still in the background.

                             BRISCOE
               You got a helluva nerve, whoever
               you are.

     The Postman doesn't rise to the bait.

                             THE POSTMAN
               Is Abby around?

                             BRISCOE
               She and Michael are working the
               north meadow this morning.

     Briscoe reins up -- he's gone as far as his duty commands.

                             BRISCOE
               Well, you're on your own.

     The Postman tips his cap and continues riding by "Pine
     View - Population 132." Briscoe watches a moment, then
     calls after him:

                            BRISCOE
               Hey! Are you really who you say
               you are?

                             THE POSTMAN
               If I come back with some mail,
               you'll know!

     The Postman continues. Caught in an inner turmoil,
     Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter.
     He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman.

                              BRISCOE
               God damn it!

     Briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. He hands The
     Postman the letter, then rides back for town. The Postman
     watches Briscoe. The people lining the wall. And he
     realizes just what effect he's had. There's nothing to
     do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. Strains of
     "AMERICA" still ECHO hauntingly OVER:


45   EXT. ON ROAD - SUN                                           45

     A green and lavender sunset. In the middle of nowhere,
     The Postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. He
     flips through some of the letters entrusted to him.

                                   THE POSTMAN

                  Seattle. Boise... St. Rose,
                  Paradise on the Pacific...

     He considers the letter, looks around as if someone may be
     watching. He just begins to tear the corner, then stops.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Maybe one thing can still be
                  sacred.
                          (to horse)
                  All in all, not a bad gig, huh?

     The HORSE SNORTS. Smiling, The Postman shoves the
     envelope into his bag. As he does, he finds something
     else. The red ribbon. He runs it through his fingers,
     thinks wistfully of Abby. Then, like a knight of old
     representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and
     rides on.


46   EXT. WELL (PINE VIEW) - DAY                                    46

     Abby's washing clothes with a tub and washboard. Waging
     war on dirt. Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby
     at work until she notices him. She wipes the sweat from
     her brow, tries not to smile.

                                ABBY
                  What are you looking at?

                                  MICHAEL
                  Everything.

     He steps over and they're in each other's arms. This is
     love. But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar
     alarm:

                                  SENTRY
                  Holnists!    Holnists are coming!


47   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - DAY                          47

     Led by Bethlehem and Getty, the soldiers ride in.
     Something about the citizens disturbs Bethlehem.

     Bethlehem reins in across from the post office.     Someone
     has hung a tattered old American flag.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Who's responsible for that?!

     No one answers.     All heads are down now.


48   INT. POST OFFICE - DAY                                           48

     Ford is sweeping up. The place looks almost presentable.
     He stops when he hears Bethlehem calling once more for the
     responsible party.

     Ford starts forward.    Suddenly Briscoe is blocking his
     way.

                                BRISCOE
                  Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay
                  out of sight.

                                FORD
                  I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding
                  from anyone. I --

     Briscoe grabs him by the shirt, hauls him out the back
     way.

                                BRISCOE
                  You stay out of this, or I'll lock
                  you up myself damnit.


49   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                             49

     Bethlehem picks Michael out of the crowd.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  You.  You'll be responsible.
                         (to soldiers)
                  Get him a torch.

     Michael walks out into the square. One of the soldiers
     returns with a burning torch, gives it to Michael.

     Bethlehem looks at the town, then at Michael.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Set that flag on fire.

     ON MICHAEL

     It's killing him, but Michael sets the torch to the flag.
                              BETHLEHEM
               Now throw it through the window of
               your 'post office.'

     CRASH!    The TORCH goes through the post office WINDOW.


     ON FORD

     Struggling to get out, but Briscoe blocks his way.


     ON BETHLEHEM

     As flames grow, he takes one last look around.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  The United States doesn't exist.
                  That flag is an abomination.

     Briscoe steps forward, attempts to diffuse the situation.

                                BRISCOE
                  General Bethlehem.
                         (as Bethlehem turns)
                  We're gathering the tribute, sir.
                  Can I take your wagons?

     Bethlehem decides not to kill anyone, looks to Getty.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Make sure that fire doesn't go
                  out.

     The General joins Briscoe.

     Tears on his cheeks, Ford watches the post office burn.


50   EXT. PARKING LOT (PINE VIEW) - EARLY EVENING                     50

     Bethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded.
     Michael is just passing with a sack of grain on his
     shoulder, when Bethlehem looks across the street -- spies
     Abby and some of the other women sewing grain sacks shut.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a
                  first-rate piece of ass.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Michael overhears. He looks over as Bethlehem's men nod
     in agreement. Michael sees that they're talking about
     Abby.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Tell the Sheriff I want to be
                  introduced. She does not belong
                  in a mudhole like this.

     One of the men hurries off. It's concern for Abby, not
     for his manhood that makes him step forward.

                                MICHAEL
                  Excuse me.

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (looks over)
                  You again?

                                 MICHAEL
                  That's my wife, General.   She's a
                  married woman.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Do you know what system of
                  government we have here, son?
                         (as Michael shrugs)
                  A feudal system. Like the Middle
                  Ages. With lords and vassals.
                  That's you and me. Those lords,
                  they had some ideas. If a vassal
                  got married, it was the lord's
                  right, his right, to sleep with
                  the bride on the wedding night.

                                MICHAEL
                  Me and Abby have been married for
                  three years.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Sorry, but I wasn't invited to the
                  wedding. Now, you've already done
                  me one favor, son. Don't let this
                  be a black mark on an otherwise
                  perfect record.


     ABBY

     Another woman has pointed out to her what's going on. She
     can't hear what's being said, but she watches, concerned.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     PARKING LOT

                                BETHLEHEM
                  We'll be civilized about this. I
                  want you to give me your blessing.

                                   MICHAEL
                  Sir, I can't.     You can't.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Can't? I'm tired of can't. We
                  had a great nation once. Do you
                  know what made it that way? I
                  can! Till the weak came along.
                  The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But
                  I'm going to make us strong again.
                  I'm going to be the father of a
                  new nation.
                         (draws his sword)
                  Do you know why it will be me?

     Michael looks to Abby as she starts across the street.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Because I can!

     The SWORD WHISTLES down.       Accompanied by an anguished cry:

                                   ABBY
                  Michael!

     Abby rushes forward, but she's blocked by Getty and
     another man. She cries out again and again.

     Filled with impotent fury, Briscoe squeezes out the words.

                                BRISCOE
                  You didn't have to --

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Didn't have to what, Sheriff?

     Three Holnist soldiers draw down on Briscoe.      Bethlehem
     circles, menacing on his horse.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Your people seem seditious.    You
                  seem seditious.

     Briscoe stares down at Michael's crumpled form.      Abby
     wails.

                  Aw, Michael...

     Briscoe might go after Bethlehem despite the odds.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What am I seeing here? I'm
                  waiting.

                                BRISCOE
                         (burying his anger)
                  Man came through here. With mail.
                  Said he was a postman. Said the
                  government had been restored back
                  east.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What government?

     From out of the crowd -- a voice.         Ford.

                                FORD
                  The United States government.

     Bethlehem whirls his horse at the noise.

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Who said that?

     Not waiting for an answer, Getty charges the crowd, knocks
     one of the onlookers down. A dead silence.

     Bethlehem frowns, thinks it over a minute.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Which way did he go?
                         (a beat)
                  Do not make me ask again.

                                   BRISCOE
                          (lies)
                  East.

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (to Getty)
                  Send a patrol east. Send three
                  more south, north and west.
                         (to Briscoe)
                  They'd better find him east.


51   EXT. PALISADE GATES (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                      51

     The Holnist army rides out. Overcome by grief, tied at
     the wrists, Abby stumbles behind one of the wagons.

                                                             64.

52   EXT. BURNT-OUT POST OFFICE - NIGHT                            52

     Before the smoking ruins, Ford pulls on a blue shirt, his
     homemade postal flag on the shoulder. As Briscoe steps
     up, Ford shows him a bundle of singed, but intact letters.

                             FORD
               I managed to save these.

                             BRISCOE
                      (re: shirt)
               Take that thing off, Johnny.    You
               want to die, too?

     Ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs
     onto his waiting pony.

                             FORD
               I'm headed south. With the mail.

                             BRISCOE

               Don't be a damn fool.

                             FORD
               What kind should I be?... Haw!

     Ford digs his heels into the pony and is off in a flash
     doing damn near a buck seventy-five.


53   INT. MOVIE THEATER (BENNING, OREGON) - DAY                    53

     Mail call. The Postman stands in front of the torn
     screen. Hoping for glory by association, the smiling
     Mayor stands beside him. The ragged people of Benning
     clamor in front. Kids smile up at him as he calls out
     names:

                              THE POSTMAN
               Rachel Clark!

     The Postman nods, sticks the letter back in his bag.

                             THE POSTMAN
               That's it for now, folks.
               There'll be more once a real
               system is in place.

     As usual, The Postman is assaulted with questions.

                                MAN
                  Tell us about President Starkey!

                                WOMAN
                  What about New York City?   Did
                  they survive the plague?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Survive? They got Broadway up and
                  running again. There's a kid
                  doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you
                  wouldn't believe.

     An older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful
     news.

                                MAN #3
                  How much is it to mail a letter?

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (smiles)
                  A buck seventy-five.

                                MAN #3
                  That sounds awful cheap.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The catch is the only currency
                  recognized are silver American
                  coins minted before 1964 and two
                  dollar bills. Look for Thomas
                  Jefferson. Of course, food is
                  always acceptable as barter.

     The moment is split by a SIREN.


54   EXT. BENNING, OREGON - DAY                                      54

     A long double-line of Holnist Cavalry stand in formation
     in front of the city walls made from stacks of crushed
     cars. On top, a SKINNY SENTRY CRANKS the SIREN while a
     CHUBBY SENTRY watches.

     Bethlehem rides through them with Abby in tow -- her
     wrists tied by a rope which is looped around the pommel of
     Bethlehem's saddle. Her face is bruised, her bottom lip
     split. Bethlehem reins up, puzzled by the apparent stall.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What?

                                GIBBS
                  They say they got a representative
                  of the restored United States in
                  there. They say this army is
                  illegal. They say --

     The Chubby Sentry answers from the top of the palisade.

                                CHUBBY SENTRY
                  Drop dead and go to hell!

     The Chubby Sentry disappears back behind cover. Bethlehem
     remains controlled, but his manner becomes deadly.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  The Romans had an expression they
                  used to scare their children.
                  'Hannibal ad portas!' -- Hannibal
                  is at the gates. Do you know who
                  Hannibal was?
                         (as she doesn't answer)
                  Of course not. A pretty girl like
                  you wouldn't know a thing.
                         (to Getty)
                  Colonel Getty, get some men up
                  there and open that gate.


55   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                     55

     The Mayor hurries over, The Postman following reluctantly
     behind. The Mayor spots the Sentries up on the parapet.

                                MAYOR
                  What the hell are you doing?!
                  Open the gates!

                                SKINNY SENTRY
                  Government's restored! We don't
                  have to take their crap anymore!


56   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                         56

     Two Holnists scale the gates. They're near the top when
     the Skinny Sentry appears. He FIRES an ARROW. Hit
     through the shoulder, one Holnist falls. The other jumps.

                                                               67.

57   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               57

     Chubby and Skinny duck down behind the safety of the
     walls, trading high-fives.


58   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                             58

     Bethlehem orders his men to pull back. He shakes his
     head, a quiet rage building. But he knows there's no
     military threat here. It's going to be a massacre.


59   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               59

     Climbing an inside ladder, the Mayor slams the Chubby
     Sentry against the wall.

                              MAYOR
               Idiots!

                             CITIZEN #1
                      (realizing; scared)
               They're gonna kill us all.

     The Mayor peers out through an observation hole.   The
     Postman and several others join him.

                              CHUBBY SENTRY
               No!   Let's fight them!

                             MAYOR
               With what? We got five guns maybe
               20 rounds of ammo in the whole
               town! How do we fight them with
               that?!

     The Postman watches the Holnists prepare for attack.

                            THE POSTMAN
               You don't. Negotiate a
               settlement. Give them extra
               supplies.

     The men look at each other.   Sounds reasonable enough.

                             MAYOR
               Okay. You're a government rep.
               You go tell them.

     The look on The Postman's face says it all.

                                                               68.

60   EXT. GATES (BENNING, OREGON) - DAY                              60

     They open enough to let the Postman ride out, then close
     behind him. He sits nervously on his horse waving a white
     flag. He's met, dismounts and is led to a command post
     where Bethlehem is studying a rough map of the town.

                                BETHLEHEM
               Make it quick.     I've got an attack
               to coordinate.

                             THE POSTMAN
               General, um, they've asked me to
               negotiate a peace treaty.

     The last time he and Bethlehem were face-to-face, the
     Postman had a shaved head, was dressed in rags, and was
     covered with cuts and bruises. Bethlehem can't place him,
     but there's something familiar all the same.

                                BETHLEHEM
               Do I know you?

                             THE POSTMAN
               I don't think so, sir. I --

                             BETHLEHEM
                      (scans uniform)
               You're the Postman, aren't you?


     ABBY

     watches from the flap of Bethlehem's tent.    The guard sees
     and shoves her back inside.


     BETHLEHEM AND THE POSTMAN

     Bethlehem flicks at the uniform flag shoulder patch.

                             BETHLEHEM
               The restored United States. Do
               these people really believe that
               shit? Who are you really?

     Although he wants to confess everything, something tells
     The Postman he has to try to brass it out.

                             THE POSTMAN
               I am a United States Postman.
               Authorized by order 417 of the
               restored Congress to --

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                  69.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I was at the Battle of Georgetown.
                  I watched the White House burn to
                  the ground. Don't try to sell me
                  on any restored U.S...

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The new capital is based in
                  Minneapolis. Inside the Hubert
                  Humphrey Metrodome. You know,
                  where the Vikings used to play?

                                  BETHLEHEM
                  You're funny.    Now, what are the
                  terms?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  They'll open the gate and give you
                  double what they usually give.
                  Just don't hurt anybody. This was
                  all a misunderstanding.

     Bethlehem thinks this over.


61   INT. ABBY'S TENT - DAY                                             61

     Abby tracks the guard's silhouette through the canvas.
     Her eyes search the tent -- land on the cot in the corner
     and focus on its heavy, wooden legs.


62   EXT. GATES - DAY                                                   62

     Bethlehem has decided.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Appreciate your offer, Postman.
                  Problem is, you're in no position
                  to negotiate. These people made
                  it through the bugs and the riots
                  and the three year winter. But
                  they're not going to survive you.

     Bethlehem looks to Getty and nods.      Getty motions to a
     gunner. The MONSTER GUN is FIRED.       Just as a SHELL
     EXPLODES against the gates --

63   INT. ABBY'S TENT - DAY                                             63

     Abby brings the heavy wooden cot leg down on the
     unsuspecting guard's head.

                                                              70.

64   EXT. CITY GATES - DAY                                          64

     The cavalry ride through roiling smoke into the open town.

     Horrified, The Postman steps forward, but rifles are on
     him. All he can do is watch. The Mayor is the first to
     go down.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Law six, justice can be dictated.
                       (to soldiers)
                Kill him. And kill the restored
                United States with him.

     Bethlehem turns his attention to the battle.   A CAPTAIN
     steps forward with gun raised.

                              CAPTAIN
                       (by rote)
                In accordance with law eight and
                by the authority of Emergency
                Order 46, you are hereby --

     A CRACK of RIFLE FIRE. The Captain's forehead explodes
     and he falls to the ground.

     Shocked, Bethlehem whirls for the source of the GUNFIRE.

     Abby!   FIRING from a position behind a supply wagon.

     But even as Bethlehem turns, an ARROW SINGS in and lodges
     in his arm. Fired from a pocket of sentries up on the
     palisade. Bethlehem bellows in outrage and pain.

     The Postman takes advantage of the moment of chaos to grab
     the fallen Captain's gun.

     He pulls a Holnist rider from his horse and swings into
     the saddle. The unhorsed rider goes for his gun. But
     once more SHOTS RING OUT and he goes down.

     Bethlehem ducks as another BULLET ZINGS close.    Too close.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Get her.

     Two soldiers move forward.

     Suddenly The Postman's HORSE comes THUNDERING -- trampling
     the Holnist nearest him.

     The other Holnist hears, looks back, sees The Postman
     coming and takes aim just as The Postman brings his gun to
     bear.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 71.

64   CONTINUED:                                                         64

     The Holnist FIRES first. We don't see the hit. Just
     watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND. The
     Holnist goes down.

     The Postman reins up alongside the wagon. Grunting with
     pain, he reaches down, takes Abby's arm and swings her up
     behind him. Then digs his heels in for all he's worth.

     More Holnists come on the run. They FIRE. The HORSE
     SNORTS in pain. He's hit. But The Postman urges him on,
     heading into the woods.

     Bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts:

                                   BETHLEHEM
                  Colonel Getty!


65   EXT. WOODLAND ROAD - DAY                                           65

     Abby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot.

                                ABBY
                  We can't stop now. They'll be
                  coming after us.

     The Postman's head lolls forward. She feels something on
     her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. The Postman's
     shot in the belly.

     The horse is failing.       Near death.

     We hear the sound of PURSUING CAVALRY. Abby urges the
     horse off the road. When the thicket grows too dense,
     Abby jumps down. She catches The Postman as he slides
     off, easing him to the ground.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                            (disoriented)
                  Abby...

     Abby shushes him. She pulls on the horse's bridle to
     force him farther along. But it's no good, the wounded
     horse goes down on its knees.

     And five RIDERS THUNDER past.       Fooled.   All but the SIXTH,
     who pulls up to listen.

     In the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black
     smoke. The town is burning.

     The HORSE WHINNIES: in its death throes.        Abby panics,
     tries to quiet the horse.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                             72.

65   CONTINUED:                                                    65

     The Sixth Soldier has heard the suffering horse. He draws
     his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the
     thicket.


     ON ABBY AND POSTMAN

     The Postman lies unconscious on the ground. Abby sits
     beside him, rifle in hand. The Sixth Soldier appears.

                                  ABBY
                  Don't move.

     He hesitates at first. Then dismounts and moves toward
     her. Abby cocks the rifle.

                                SIXTH SOLDIER
                  If you'd had a bullet, you'd a
                  used it by now.

     Moving closer still, he doesn't see the BRANCH pulled back
     in The Postman's hand until it SNAPS hard into his face.

     He stumbles back.

                                  ABBY
                  You're right.

     Abby dashes out, rifle in hand. She swings for the
     bleachers. The butt catches the side of the Sixth
     Soldier's head. He falls hard.

     The Postman's eyes flutter. Dazed, he watches as Abby
     pilfers through the Soldier's gear. She takes everything
     of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. His eyes flutter
     closed.


66   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                              66

     Snowflakes swirl. Abby lays a sapling travois beside The
     Postman. He groans as she rolls him onto it, tucks a
     blanket around him. Using all the strength God gave her,
     Abby lifts one end, gets it high enough to hitch it to the
     Sixth Soldier's horse. As Abby leads the horse away...


67   EXT. WOOD ROAD - DAY                                          67

     The snow has increased. A Holnist patrol moves down the
     road, disappears around a bend. A beat.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               73.

     Abby appears, leading the horse and travois.   She crosses
     the road and disappears into the woods.

     A moment later, she reappears with a pine branch which she
     uses to brush at the snow, obscuring their tracks.


68   EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAINS (OREGON) - DAY                            68

     Riding into a blizzard, Abby leads the way up a zigzag
     path. A valley opens up below. The unconscious Postman
     lies bundled on the travois.


69   EXT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        69

     A little square shape just visible beyond a creek.     Abby
     leads the horse and travois-bound Postman to it.


70   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        70

     One room. Dirt floor. The WINDOWS RATTLE in the WIND.
     Snow falls through a hole in the roof. The wooden DOOR
     BURSTS back and Abby enters. Half-frozen, she leads the
     horse and the travois right inside.


71   INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT                                       71

     A fire has been lit.

     The Postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as Abby
     washes around his wound. She pulls the shirt back to
     clean his chest. The material falls away and Abby stops
     short. There -- high on his biceps -- a branded "8." She
     stares in disbelief.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


72   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         72

     The Postman lies on a cot below the window.    He's
     conscious, but pale as a ghost.

     Abby brings him a bowl of soup. Very thin soup.       Stirring
     it with a spoon, The Postman smiles at Abby.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thank you.

     She turns her back on him without a word.   The Postman
     tries an exchange just the same.

                  I don't think I ever had water
                  soup before. Maybe next time we
                  could try it with a little sand?
                         (as she doesn't respond)
                  Dirt? Wood?
                         (as she doesn't smile)
                  A twig garnish?

     She goes about her business in silence.

                  You used to think I was funny.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  I'm sorry.

     He takes a spoonful of soup and she comes to him.

                                ABBY
                  How sorry are you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What's that supposed to mean?

     Her right hand flashes out, holds a knife up under his
     chin.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What's with you?

                  You got the mark of eight on you.

     A long beat. Finally, he swallows the soup in his mouth.
     The action presses his Adam's apple against the blade.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  A mark doesn't mean I'm a --

                  Then, why didn't you?

     If she knows, she's not ready to say yet.

                  You were with Bethlehem. Does
                  that make you one of them?

     Abby considers this, The Postman's gaze flickers down to
     the spoon he still holds in his hand. Taking one last
     stab at a joke.

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (re: the spoon)
                  Don't make me use this.

     Abby doesn't laugh.      But she does relent.   She steps away.


73   EXT. HUNTING SHACK/VALLEY PASS - SUNSET                           73

     The hunting shack huddled against the south side of a low
     rise. Beyond the rise, a pass. But there's no
     negotiating it now. It's completely snowed in. And
     another storm is on the way.


74   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                          74

     WIND HOWLING in the b.g. The Postman lies back on his
     cot. The little shack has been scoured clean. Abby
     stares listlessly at the fire. The silence is torture.
     The Postman tries to strike up a conversation.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Wind's come up.

                  Getting colder too. Must be
                  another storm --

     Abby gets up and throws a log on the fire.

                                   ABBY

                  Lazy?! I got a hole in my
                  stomach. I'm weak. The two big
                  meals around here are grass and
                  snow. And we're running out of
                  grass.

     As the two of them glare at each other for a moment.     Abby
     starts to put on her coat.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Where are you going?

     Abby doesn't answer. She picks up the rifle and starts to
     lead the horse outside.

                                THE POSTMAN

     Abby is out the door without a word.

     HOLD ON The Postman in the window as she continues past.
     He watches a moment, suddenly grimaces. A GUNSHOT. The
     THUD of a BODY SLAMMING to the GROUND. Abby has shot the
     horse.

     Tiny tracks in the snow, leading away from the shack.
     Abby struggles to make the monumental climb from the shack
     to the top of the rise where she can get a clear view of
     the pass.

     PAN PAST her UP TO the top of the rise. It's a clear day
     -- but the pass is still snowed-in. No sign of winter
     receding.

     A few flakes of snow have begun to drift down. The
     Postman sits at the window -- starts to play tic-tac-toe

     The fire is dying. The food untouched. The Postman sits
     in bed staring anxiously out the window. The snow has
     turned into a blizzard. He runs Abby's red ribbon through
     his hands.

     The door opens and out steps The Postman. In pain, he
     staggers around the back of the cabin -- in search of her.

               I can't help you.

     Finally, he pulls himself to his knees. She does the
     same. They climb each other to a standing position. Arm-
     in-arm, they start for the cabin.

     Abby sits huddled in blankets. The fire is blazing. The
     Postman steps over, sets the once-again-hot bowl of stew

     Then, he catches his reflection in the water.       Tangled
     beard. Matted hair. Is that him?

     He suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed
     vigor. We get a sense he's not going to use it on the
     fish.


     HANDS

     plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. We START ON
     The Postman's back, then ARC AROUND as he washes his face.
     He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting
     knife. He's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement
     and he smiles in satisfaction -- until he sees --

     Abby, reflected in the water.

     Behind her, he sees the cabin is on fire.       Takes off
     running.

                  What happened?

     He's nonplused to find Abby standing beside a pile of

                  I'd appreciate if you'd walk with
                  me long enough to find someplace
                  safe for the baby. Then we can
                  split up.
                         (a beat)
                  You shaved.

     The Postman has all but forgotten.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                  Yeah...

                                   ABBY
                  It looks nice.

     Before he can respond, she's heading off toward the pass,
     leaving The Postman to shake his head at the absurdity of
     it all. He shouts after her.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You're really weird, you know
                  that?

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


90   EXT. VALLEY - BELOW CASCADE MOUNTAINS - DAY                     90

     Carrying their gear, Abby and The Postman walk across a
     meadow of wild flowers, headed for an old road.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Have you ever heard of St. Rose,
                  Abby?

                                ABBY
                  I've heard people talk. I've
                  heard lots of names. Bliss.
                  Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff
                  Briscoe says it's a fantasy.

                                                             82.

90   CONTINUED:                                                    90

                               THE POSTMAN
                  He's wrong. St. Rose is out
                  there. And I'm going to find it.

                                ABBY
                  But you're The Postman.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Look, I'm nobody, Abby. I'm
                  just...

     Before he can come clean -- they see a distant RIDER
     coming hard. The Postman unslings the rifle, slides a
     round into the chamber.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  This is what I hate. Strangers.
                  Do you say 'hi' or do you blow
                  their head off? Do they want to
                  share what they got or take what
                  you have? And if they want to
                  take, how far are you willing to
                  go to stop them? Damn it.
                         (to the Rider)
                  All right. That's far enough.

     The Rider pulls up short, wearing a blue home-made
     uniform.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  We don't want any trouble.

                                RIDER
                  Me neither, mister.

     The Postman is taken aback. The Rider, a girl, pulls off
     her cap, mops it across her brow. Maybe 14, we'll always
     know her by her Ponytail. Abby registers the uniform
     first.

                                  ABBY
                  What are you?

                                PONYTAIL (RIDER)
                  Carrier 18. U.S. Postal Service.
                  Got any mail?

     Lowering the rifle, The Postman looks over at Abby, back
     to Ponytail.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  That's impossible.

                                PONYTAIL
                  Ain't you heard of The Postman?

                                  ABBY
                  No, tell us.

                                PONYTAIL
                  He's only the greatest man who
                  ever lived. He crossed the
                  wasteland, shook his fist at the
                  enemy and spit in the eye of
                  General Bethlehem himself. He's
                  back east with President Starkey
                  right now.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Who told you all this?

                                PONYTAIL
                  Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.
                  He's in direct contact with the
                  restored congress.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Direct contact... I don't believe
                  this.

                                PONYTAIL
                         (growing irritated)
                  Do you have mail, or don't you?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  You said Carrier Eighteen. That
                  mean there's eighteen of you?

                                  PONYTAIL
                  Thirty-two.    As of midnight.


91   EXT. R.V. PARK - DAY                                           91

     Oregon's main post office. A silver Airstream, fifty
     mobile homes and rusty Winnebagos resting on flat tires.
     Flying from a pole: the flag of the restored United
     States. A young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a
     Winnebago.

     Ford walks along an RV boulevard. He's joined by two
     young carriers, RED and Chubby (the sentry from Benning).
     All wear hip, personalized variations of the official
     uniform.

                                CHUBBY
                  You got another letter?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              84.

     They come around the corner to where seven young recruits
     wait. They're joined by another twenty carriers.

                                   FORD
                  More recruits?

                                RED
                  Seven of them. They're coming
                  from everywhere.

     Ford looks them over in satisfaction.

                                CHUBBY
                  Did you get a letter or didn't
                  you?

     Ford smiles, reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a
     creased sheet of paper. Chubby grins.

                                FORD
                  Gather 'round, everybody. Got
                  another letter here. Came in last
                  night.

     Buzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around Ford.


     SOUTH END OF BOULEVARD

     Ponytail leads Abby and The Postman. They come up in the
     back of the crowd. Flanked by Red and Chubby, Ford stands
     on the hood of a car, letter in hand. The Postman taps a
     clueless YOUNG CARRIER on the back.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  What's all this?

                                YOUNG CARRIER
                  Postman sent Ford another letter.
                  He's gonna read it.

                                FORD
                         (reading)
                  'Hello, all postal carriers.'

                                  CARRIERS
                           (a ritual)
                  Hello!

                                FORD
                  I'm here in Minneapolis with
                  President Starkey, but my thoughts
                  are with you. Remember, nothing
                  worth doing can be done overnight.
                  Keep your chins up and do your
                  best not to get shot. Signed, The
                  Postman.

     A buzz goes through the crowd.       Ponytail looks over.

                                PONYTAIL
                  His letters are always kind of
                  short.

     Abby and The Postman exchange a look.

                                FORD
                         (looks up)
                  Hold on now. There's a P.S...
                  Anybody know what P.S. stands for?

     The Postman raises his hand. Ford looks his way. His
     mouth drops as he realizes. In silence, he walks over to
     The Postman. They embrace and all the weight Ford's been
     carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to The
     Postman. The kid nearly collapses.

                                 CHUBBY
                  Holy shit...

                                RED
                  That would be H.S., Chubby.

                                CHUBBY
                  I seen him once when I lived in
                  Benning. It's The Postman!

     Word goes through the crowd like a wave.

     The Postman takes the letter, reads.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  P.S.   Ford knows what to do.

     Ford shrugs sheepishly.

                                FORD
                  Guess you want to talk about this?

     The Postman takes Ford by the elbow. They disappear into
     the tent. The carriers just staring after them,
     awestruck.

     They clamor around her.


92   INT. TENT - DAY                                                 92

     The Postman and Ford.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  President Starkey? Minneapolis?
                  Ford knows what to do?

                                FORD
                  I thought you were dead.

                               THE POSTMAN
                  So? I'm not making the
                  connection. What's all this then?

                                FORD
                  I lied. I told people you were in
                  contact with me.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                  Why?

                                FORD
                  Because I didn't want it to end.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I don't know how long I can stay,
                  Ford. President Starkey will send
                  word one day and I'll have to move
                  on. Understand?

                               FORD
                  Sure. But you'll stay till he
                  sends word? Right?

     The Postman can't answer, just turns and walks out of the
     tent.


93   EXT. TENT - DAY                                                 93

     As The Postman exits, Chubby leads the carriers in a
     salute. The Postman actually turns a moment to see if
     someone else is standing behind him.

     He looks back, sees the young, shining faces.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Aw, don't do that. Hands down.

     Their hands go down in one crisp military move. The
     Postman looks at Abby, to Ford as he exits the tent.         The
     kid is craving reassurance.

                                FORD
                  You'll stay 'til President Starkey
                  sends word, right? Right?

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Yeah, till he sends word, right.

     Ford smiles, gestures to the carriers.

                                FORD
                  Could you say a few words?

     The Postman looks over at the carriers.    They quiet under
     his gaze, immediately respectful.

     The problem is, he has no idea what to say.       Finally:

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Two plus two equals four.

     The cheering is tumultuous. The Postman picks Abby out of
     the cheering crowd -- the look on her face says it all.


94   EXT. RV PARK - WINNEBAGO ROW - DAY                                 94

     The guts of the operation. Several carriers are busy
     sorting and bagging letters. It goes out pinned to a
     clothesline which crisscrosses back and forth. Everyone
     follows as Ford takes The Postman on a tour. There are
     hushed whispers among those who are seeing him for the
     first time.

                                FORD
                  We bring all the mail here first.
                  We sort it, group it and then it
                  goes out. So far we got thirty
                  routes.

     Ford leads The Postman and Abby into another Winnebago.
     Chubby and Red and Ponytail follow. Those that can't fit
     just peer in through the windows.

                                                           88.

95   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                         95

     An old manual crank printing press is working away. Ford
     proudly removes a sheet, shows it to The Postman. A
     caricature of eight evil Holnists, forming a figure eight.
     Beneath: "Unite Against Holnist Tyrraney!"

                             THE POSTMAN
               You spelled tyranny wrong.

                             CHUBBY
                      (low, to Red)
               Boy, he's smart.

     The seven young Recruits seen earlier stand in a line.
     They're joined by OLD GEORGE, every day of 75 years old.

     Ponytail holds up her hand, swears them in.

                             PONYTAIL/RECRUITS
               Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
               nor gloom of night...

     As they finish, The Postman and Ford pass by. The
     Recruits salute. Shaking his head, The Postman's about to
     salute back when he spots Old George. George has a faded
     purple "AIRBORNE" tattoo on his arm and a twinkle in his
     eye. There's an old crow on his shoulder.

                             THE POSTMAN
               How old are you?

                             OLD GEORGE
               Seventy-five, sir.

     The Postman looks over at Ford, who shrugs.

                               THE POSTMAN
               Can you ride?

                            OLD GEORGE
               Nope. Can't walk too good,
               either.

                             THE POSTMAN
               Why are you here?

                               OLD GEORGE
               I know stuff.

     The Postman looks at Ford again.   Then:

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               89.

96   CONTINUED:                                                      96

                                THE POSTMAN
                         (re: tattoo)
                  When did you get that?

                                 OLD GEORGE
                  1970. A girl with eyes as big as
                  saucers did me in a little town
                  called Saigon.


97   EXT. RV CAMP - AIRSTREAM - SUNSET                               97

     Carriers move items out of the trailer. The camp is
     buzzing as usual. The Postman looks on -- sees Abby
     passing by.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Abby --

                                ABBY
                  Yes?

     He's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with
     it.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Ford wants me to have his trailer.
                  Said it's the best one.

                                ABBY
                  I'm on the other side of town.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  I got plenty of room here.

     She shakes her head, and then walks away. The Postman
     watches her disappear into the bustle of the camp.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  So much for the uniform theory.


98   EXT. HOLNIST WINTER CAMP (NORTHERN CALIFORNIA) - SUNSET         98

     The same sun sets on the Holnist camp.


99   INT. BETHLEHEM'S TENT - SUNSET                                  99

     Bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand.
     He's trying another style -- Impressionism -- and it's
     worse than the last. He looks over as Getty and Gibbs
     approach with a PRISONER.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                              90.

99   CONTINUED:                                                     99

                                BETHLEHEM
                  What do you think, Lieutenant?

                                GIBBS
                  Can't tell what it is if you stand
                  too close. The colors all kinda
                  run together, don't they?

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Yes...

     Bethlehem looks away from his painting to see Gibbs and
     Getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier. For an
     instant, mistakes him for:

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Well, if it isn't our old friend
                  the U.P.S. man.

                                GIBBS
                  We captured him on the Oregon
                  border.

     Realizing, Bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side.

                                BETHLEHEM
                  Who the hell are you?

                                CARRIER (PRISONER)
                  Carrier Twelve. United States,
                  um, Postal Service.

     Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda
     onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up.

     It's hard to say what he's thinking.      Finally:

                                BETHLEHEM
                  I want the camp struck at dawn.
                  We're moving north.

                                GIBBS
                  Yes, sir.

     Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve.

                                BETHLEHEM
                         (chilling)
                  You spelled tyranny wrong.

                                                              91.

100   EXT. RV CAMP - DAWN                                           100

      Ten letter carriers are on horseback. Among them, Red and
      Ponytail. Ford and The Postman are also on horses. Each
      rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti-
      Holnist propaganda from Ford.

                              THE POSTMAN
                I wish they'd stop saluting.

      It's annoying him. As Chubby rides up. The Postman
      catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute. So
      Chubby salutes with the left hand instead. As they line
      up:

                              THE POSTMAN
                Just stay safe and remember. The
                mailman's more important than the
                mail.

                              CHUBBY
                Boy, he's smart.

      The sun just peeks up over the horizon. At that signal,
      the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them.
      The look on their faces. The glory of it all. They're
      alive! The Postman hesitates, watches after them a
      moment.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                What the hell?

      Urging his horse forward, he rides after them. With them.
      And then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots
      off in a separate direction. Headed for all points of the
      compass and some in between.


101   EXT. OREGON HAMLET - DAY                                      101

      The Postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his
      horse and smiles.

                              THE POSTMAN
                For President Starkey and the
                First Congress of the Restored
                United States, I officially
                declare Postal Station 10...
                What's the name of this town?

                              YOUNG LEADER
                We never named it.

                              THE POSTMAN
                       (thinks; smiles)
                I officially declare Postal
                Station 10 in Elvis, Oregon, open
                for business!

                                                              92.

102   EXT. TOWN (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY                         102

      An eye-blink of a town. Ponytail stands on a crate
      reading names and handing letters to the grateful people
      massed around her.


103   EXT. TOWN (IDAHO BORDER) - DAY                                103

      Red and Chubby finish mail call, exchange an amazed look
      as they're offered a platter of food.


104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                          104

      The moon hangs low over an interstate. A rider is
      silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post-
      apocalyptic Don Quixote. It's The Postman.


105   EXT. FARMHOUSE/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                             105

      Seen FROM the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road
      beyond.

      A LITTLE BOY comes rushing out, letter in hand. The boy
      pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far
      gone. The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed.

                                LITTLE BOY
                I missed him.

      It's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the
      distance and turns back around. A frozen beat and he
      starts galloping back down the road.

      Fearless, the boy holds out the letter. The rider closes;
      it's The Postman. The boy stretches out as far as he can.
      Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the
      saddle, snatches the letter as he passes.

      The boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be
      when he grows up.


106   EXT. PINE VIEW GATES - DAY                                    106

      Sheriff Briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the
      ladder and onto the top of the palisade.

                              BRISCOE
                Phil, this better not be another
                of your U.F.O.'s.

      He looks where the sentry points. The Postman waits at
      the gate, behind him on horseback: Ford and Abby.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                93.

106   CONTINUED:                                                      106

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   I'm back!   And I got mail.

                                 BRISCOE
                          (amazed)
                   I'll be damned.


107   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - DAY                                    107

      The Postman rides with Briscoe, hurrying to stay alongside
      him. Half the town jogs along behind them.

                                 FORD
                   Bethlehem is offering a 1000
                   pounds of gold to whoever brings
                   you in. Dead or alive.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Thank God it wasn't a carton of
                   cigarettes.

                                 BRISCOE
                   I'd have shot you myself.


108   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - NIGHT                                  108

      Pine View is throwing a party. It's in full swing. A
      couple of guitars. A banjo and a trombone. Everyone
      dances.

      The Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs. March as her
      letter is read to her. Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing
      with Ford. He seems, for the first time, truly happy.
      For that matter, so does Briscoe.

                                 BRISCOE
                   Things are getting better.
                   Getting better all the time.
                          (a beat)
                   I don't know who you are, but I do
                   know I was wrong about you.

      The Postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Got a letter for you, Sheriff.

      Briscoe turns it over in his hands, looks up in wonder.

                                 BRISCOE
                   It's from my sister. I thought
                   she was dead.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               94.

108   CONTINUED:                                                     108

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You thought wrong.

      Briscoe has tears in his eyes.    The Postman continues on,
      embarrassed but affected.


      DANCE

      The Postman taps Ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him
      and Abby. Ford steps aside. A beat before Abby decides
      it's okay. They begin. Her eyes are on her feet, careful
      that she doesn't take a misstep. But his eyes are on her.
      And over it all, BLEEDING IN, the sound of HOOF BEATS.


109   EXT. LONELY ROAD (SOUTHERN OREGON) - NIGHT                     109

      A mail carrier, Red, rides like the devil himself was in
      pursuit. Almost. It's Getty and three Holnists.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      DANCE

      They whirl as the tempo picks up. The Postman pulls Abby
      in closer. Her eyes now move up to his.


      ROAD

      They're closing in on the terrified Red.


      DANCE

      Abby and The Postman.    The chemistry is undeniable.


      ROAD

      RIFLES CRACK. SHOT in the back, Red throws back his arms.
      Letters flutter from the mail bag over his shoulder; he
      seems to glide along that way forever.


      DANCE

      The Postman looks at Abby; she's so beautiful.    Like only
      a pregnant woman can be.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

109   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 109

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Tell me about the baby, Abby.   I
                   want to know.

      Abby snaps out of the dream she's in. This isn't right.
      Breaking away, she heads off. As he watches her go:


      ROAD

      Red falls from his horse.    One of the soldiers scoops up
      his mailbag.

                                                        CUT TO:


110   INT. COMMAND TENT (SOUTHERN OREGON) - NIGHT                       110

      By lantern, Bethlehem and Getty watch as Gibbs sorts
      through the contents of the confiscated mailbag.

                                 GIBBS
                   Births and deaths, the weather,
                   gossip. There's nothing here.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Nothing? Everything is here.    Am
                   I the only one who sees that?
                          (to Gibbs)
                   Get out!

      Gibbs hurries away, leaving Bethlehem and Getty alone.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Give the people back their hope
                   and their dreams won't be far
                   behind.

      Bethlehem sees Getty waiting.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   What is it, Getty?

      Getty hands Bethlehem a sheet of paper -- something Gibbs
      missed. It's a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of
      The Postman leading a few carriers against Bethlehem and
      his army -- represented as Hitler and the Nazis. The
      caption underneath reads: "Ride Against the Holnist

                          (crumpling the paper)
                   A military man, especially a
                   commander, should keep a journal.
                   After he's gone, it's the only
                   real defense against the slander
                   that arises.


111   INT. OLD GEORGE'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               111

      Old George sits hunched over a home-made shortwave radio
      with a joint in his mouth. The Postman sits beside him,
      listening as STATIC pours from an old car SPEAKER.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Who do you talk to?

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Not a soul in seven years of
                   trying. But I will.

      The Postman steps to a telescope pointing up through a
      hole in the trailer ceiling.

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Go ahead. Take a look.
                          (offering joint)
                   Want some?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   No. No thanks. Hey, don't let
                   the kids see that.

      George nods and goes on playing with the dials --
      searching for a voice in the void.

      The Postman focuses on the moon.

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   I was an aerospace engineer. I
                   helped design the Galileo space
                   station.
                          (scanning sky)
                   I dream it's orbiting Earth
                   forever. With a dozen human
                   skeletons all grinning at each
                   other. Laughing at us down here.

      There's an urgent KNOCKING on the trailer door.    Ford
      appears.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   What is it?

                                  FORD
                   It's Red.   He's overdue.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   That makes five. All on Southern
                   routes.


112   EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY                                        112

      Five dead mail carriers have been laid out on the asphalt.
      Bethlehem walks the line, looking for his elusive arch-
      enemy.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   No.  No. Not him. No.
                          (looks to soldiers)
                   Children. I want a man and you
                   bring me children!


113   EXT. OREGON ROAD - DAY                                       113

      A beautiful day. Ponytail rounds a bend at a lope -- and
      then -- her eyes widen in terror. She jerks the reins;
      the horse rears in protest.

      Ahead: the truck stop. The five mail carriers hang
      upside down from the roof's overhang. A macabre sight.


      POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

      SIGHTING ON Ponytail. A hand comes INTO FRAME and brings
      the rifle barrel down. It's --


      GIBBS AND HOLNIST SHARPSHOOTER

                                 GIBBS
                   Not yet. General wants the
                   message to get back.


114   EXT. RV. CAMP - NIGHT                                        114

      PAN UP FROM The Postman's dusty boots TO his grimly
      determined face as he strides through camp and stops at
      Old George's trailer.

      He moves OUT OF FRAME, revealing -- Abby and Ponytail in
      the b.g.

                                                                98.

115   INT. OLD GEORGE'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               115

      As usual, Old George is hunkered down before his short
      wave. He looks as the door opens and The Postman enters.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Tell me about the other stuff you
                   know...

      George crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. Inside:
      twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. The CROW
      CAWS.


116   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - DAY                                        116

      Quiet. An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the
      only new structure in town. Old George sweeps the porch
      as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town.
      George makes no move to flee as they near. As they rein
      up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping.

      Sensing it, the Holnist officer looks up. There, on the
      roof, stands The Postman. Ford and Briscoe flank him --
      along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns,
      bows and rocks.

      As the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies OPEN FIRE.
      George whips up a sawed-off SHOTGUN. BOOM! Caught in the
      storm, the ten soldiers go down.

      Grim, The Postman looks to Ford as the locals cheer.
      George resumes sweeping. The mailmen climb down to strip
      the weapons off the dead.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Ford, I want you to get rid of the
                   bodies. I don't want these people
                   blamed for what we did.

      Ford nods.


117   EXT. HOLNIST ARMY CAMP - NIGHT                                  117

      Two sentries guard the east. They peer into the gloom at
      the sound of a WAGON APPROACHING. It sounds like it's
      coming fast.

                                  SENTRY
                   Halt!   Identify yourself!

      WAGON

      tearing along. Ford at the reins, urging the horses to
      all possible speed.  Then he stands, leaps to the ground.


      SENTRIES

      They raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out
      of the night. They each get off a SHOT before being
      forced to dive out of the way. The wagon continues on,
      down to...


      HOLNIST CAMP

      A soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and
      brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps
      up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written...

                                  BETHLEHEM
                          (reading)
                   Postage due...

      Bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead
      Holnist soldiers. The men around Bethlehem exchange
      looks, can't believe it. Bethlehem bellows in rage.


118   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             118

      Ford, hidden in the woods, smiles at the sound.


119   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - NIGHT                                      119

      Bethlehem steps forward and shouts his challenge into the
      night.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You want a war? I'll give you a
                   war. I was born for it!


120   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             120

      Bethlehem's words reach Ford, his smile fades. He's just
      a scared boy. He kicks his horse into a gallop and rides
      away.

                                                     CUT TO:

                                                            100.

121   EXT. SMALL AIRFIELD - DAY                                    121

      In the fog, the sound of hollow HOOF BEATS. The Postman
      rides past the shapes of airplanes. Standing silent.
      Forever grounded. The ghosts of the past.


122   EXT. RV CAMP - DAY                                           122

      Ford is swearing in four new recruits.


      ON FORD AND RECRUITS

      As they repeat after him we realize they've changed the
      oath a bit.

                              FORD/RECRUITS
                Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom
                of night. Through bandit's hell,
                through fire fight. Through flood
                and plague we cannot fail. No
                Holnist trash will stop the mail.


      THE POSTMAN

      riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with
      mail. He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear
      the words they're saying.

      As he dismounts, a fresh-faced carrier takes the bridle.
      The Postman's well past the point of fatigue. He's living
      on pure adrenaline.

                              THE POSTMAN
                Get this mail sorted. Bring me a
                fresh horse. Something to eat.

      As fresh-face starts away, The Postman calls after him.

                              THE POSTMAN
                And all the mail going South!

      The Postman watches as Ford shakes the hands of the new
      recruits.

      The Postman reaches for his canteen. Empty. Damn. A tin
      cup filled with water appears from nowhere. Abby. The
      Postman takes it, too tired to acknowledge the gesture.

                              THE POSTMAN
                They changed the oath.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                  ABBY
                   Ford's idea.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Figures.
                          (scoffs)
                   They don't think to ask who
                   they're replacing. Or why.

      He drains the cup and hands it back to her.      Just then,
      one of the new recruits, LUKE, steps over.

                                 LUKE
                   Sir? It'd be an honor if I could
                   shake your hand.

      A farmboy-type, Luke looks like a younger version of
      Woody. The Postman sees this, is lost in reverie. Luke
      still holds his hand out.

                                  LUKE
                   Sir?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You look like... Do I know you?

                                  LUKE
                   No, sir.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Well, good luck to you.

      Nodding in awe, Luke heads off.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Nice kid.   Probably be dead in a
                   week.

                                 ABBY
                          (ignores it)
                   You're exhausted. You need rest.
                   There's food in the trailer --

      Ponytail rides by; two sacks of mail hang from her saddle
      pommel. The Postman grabs her horse's halter, stops her.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Where are you going?

                                 PONYTAIL
                   Route twenty-two. I'm already an
                   hour late.

                   You're grounded. Get off the
                   horse. You know the rule.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   What rule?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Twenty-two's too far south.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   But they're waiting on their mail
                   down there.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Get off the goddamn horse.

      Shocked, she does. At the same time, fresh-face comes up
      leading a second horse laden with mail.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                          (re: Ponytail's
                           horse)
                   Tie him off to this one.

      Fresh-face goes about tying the second horse to the first.

                                 ABBY
                   You can't keep doing this.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Doing what?

                                  ABBY
                   Riding all the routes.   You're not
                   saving anyone.

      The Postman climbs on Ponytail's horse, looks at Abby.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Did I ever tell you how I got to
                   be a postman, Abby?
                          (doesn't give
                           her time to answer)
                   I don't know if you'd laugh or
                   cry.

      The Postman digs in his heels. The horse gallops away,
      the second one following behind.

                                                               103.

123   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - CLOSE ON BLOODIED POSTAL CARRIER -         123
      NIGHT

      A crowd of townsfolk are visible in deep b.g.   Beyond
      them, the town of Elvis burns to the ground.

      The CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND the BLOODIED CARRIER until we're
      looking OVER his shoulder at a firing squad led by Colonel
      Getty and Lieutenant Gibbs. Bethlehem watches.

                              GIBBS
                Ready!

      The only building not on fire is the post office. A
      SOLDIER rides up, carrying a torch, meaning to burn it.

                              SOLDIER
                The post office, General?

                              BETHLEHEM
                No. Let it stand. All by itself.
                So it can remind them what it cost
                them.

                              GIBBS
                Aim!

      Rifles are aimed.

      Shock and dismay from the townsfolk as SHOTS RING OUT.


      CLOSE ON BLOODY CARRIER'S FACE

      as he realizes he's still standing.

      PULL BACK to reveal nine bodies lying on the ground.     Only
      the Bloodied Carrier is still standing.

      Bethlehem points at the Bloodied Carrier, crooks a finger
      for him. He staggers up. Bethlehem smiles.

                              BETHLEHEM
                You think you can ride?
                       (as the Carrier
                        nods)
                Then today's your lucky day.

      Abby tends to the Bloodied Carrier.   He tries to salute as
      The Postman enters the trailer.

      Ford and Chubby watch and wait as The Postman goes to the
      boy's side.

                                 BLOODIED CARRIER
                   Bethlehem says...

      The Postman motions it's okay as the Carrier struggles.

                                 BLOODIED CARRIER
                   ... he's... headed north. He's
                   gonna kill ten people in every
                   town. Then burn it to the ground.
                   For what you did...

      The Postman is puzzled.    But Ford knows what and why.

                                 BLOODIED CARRIER
                   He said to tell you Pine View's on
                   his way. He said he'd wait there,
                   but not for long.
                          (breaking down)
                   I was so scared, sir... I thought
                   they were going to kill me, too...

      The Postman poised on a rise that affords a view of the
      gruesome spectacle below.


      POSTMAN'S POV

      Pine View in flames. The big John Deere gun has blown
      several gaps into the palisade. Bethlehem watches as his
      army sacks the town. The people have been rounded up.
      The selection of the ten has begun.

      The Postman wheels his horse around. But Ford, Ponytail,
      Chubby and Luke are standing in his way.

                                 FORD
                   What are you going to do?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I'm going to stop this.

                                 FORD
                   You can't.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Get out of my way, Ford. All of
                   you.

                                 FORD
                          (shaking his head)
                   They'll kill you.

      The Postman starts to ride through them.      Luke, Chubby and
      Ponytail move their horses to block.

      Ford maneuvers his horse in close and grabs The Postman's
      harness.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Goddamnit --

      The Postman jumps off his horse. Ford tackles him. The
      Postman shoves him away, continues on. Luke and Chubby
      pounce on him. With Ford's help, they hold him down.

                                 FORD
                   You can't help them!

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   There's still time, Ford!

      The Postman struggles.      They're genuinely having trouble
      holding him down.

                                 PONYTAIL
                          (re: The Postman)
                   You're hurting him.

      But there's no let-up.

                                 FORD
                   No, this is all my doing.    I went
                   against your orders.

      There's a moment of shocked surprise.

                                 FORD
                   The Holnists we killed. You told
                   me to bury them. But I didn't. I
                   sent Bethlehem the bodies.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Why?

                                 FORD
                   Because Bethlehem has to know that
                   we're not going to stop.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   God damn you, Ford. Those people
                   down there are dying because of
                   us. Because of what we did.

                                 FORD
                   Bullshit. They're dying because
                   of Bethlehem. They're dying
                   because this is a shitty world.
                   And if we're ever going to change
                   it, then somebody might have to
                   die. If I could make it be me
                   down there I would. But I can't.

      A terrible SCREAM gives them all pause.

      mother as her 10-year-old boy is pulled into the line.

      Sheriff Briscoe is among the ten, he puts his hand on the

                   What Ford did was wrong. But it

      Briscoe follows his gaze. He doesn't see anything, but
      maybe gets the same feeling. Bethlehem looks to Briscoe.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You feel it too, don't you?
                   Didn't have to end like this,
                   Sheriff. He knew where I'd be if
                   he wanted to face me like a man.
                   Instead, he's hiding like a
                   rabbit. So much for your Postman.

      The Postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope.
      He writes "Bethlehem" across the front, starts to write a

                Ford doesn't know what it means to
                be a kid. He doesn't have your
                memories. None of them do. All
                they've got is the lousy world we
                gave them. And this is the only
                decent thing in it.

                               THE POSTMAN
                What? Being a postman? It's all

                   Starkey.

      An excited murmur among the carriers. Only Ford eyes The

                   you gave everything and asked for
                   nothing. You beat back despair

                   that your country can never repay
                   you. But the price is too high.

                   die. It is my duty to hereby
                   disband the Postal Service of the
                   restored United States. You are
                   to burn your uniforms and The
                   Postman is to return to
                   Minneapolis at once. Thank you
                   and that is all.

      A hushed silence. The Postman walks away. The carriers
      exchange tired, defeated looks. Abby just sighs, knows
      he's not necessarily wrong.

      Ford catches up with The Postman.    He stares at The
      Postman; The Postman stares back.

                                  FORD
                           (low; fierce)
                   The President never wrote that
                   letter.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   If he could've that's what he
                   would have said.

      Ford gestures to the second letter.

                                 FORD
                   Who's the other letter to?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Bethlehem. I'm taking it to him
                   in the morning.

                                 FORD
                   What does it say?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Mail's private. You know that.

                                 FORD
                   What does it say?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (stops; turns)
                   It says it's over. It says we
                   quit.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 FORD
                   It says you quit. What about the
                   oath?

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Tell me something, Ford. How much
                   mail can a dead postman deliver?
                   It's over.

      The Postman starts to walk away again.

                                 FORD
                   Then I'll take it.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I can't trust you.

      Ford gathers courage and confronts The Postman.

                                 FORD
                   If this is the end. If this is
                   the last piece of mail that ever
                   gets delivered. I'll take it.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Whoever takes this letter probably
                   dies for it.

      Ford thrusts out his hand.

                                 FORD
                   I'm still a postman. You owe it
                   to me... I owe it to me.

      The Postman hesitates, studies the intense young man.
      Gives him the letter.


138   EXT. R.V. CAMP - STABLE AREA - DAY                               138

      The Postman is packing bags onto a horse as Abby
      approaches.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And
                   I'm taking you with me. I know
                   you don't want to hear it, but
                   that's my child inside you. I
                   want to see it born somewhere
                   safe. I have a right to that,
                   Abby. Whether you like it or not.

      Abby walks away. The Postman rests his head on his pack
      for a moment. Heavy.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                112.

      The CLICK of a GUN causes The Postman to lift his head and
      see Luke standing there.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Thought I recognized you.

                                 LUKE
                   General Bethlehem said...
                          (raises the pistol)
                   ... You should be on your knees
                   when I do it.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I don't give a damn what that
                   asshole said.

                                 LUKE
                   The general is a great man.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   The general is a fucking lunatic.

      The Postman steps forward. Stops when the barrel of the
      pistol is right against his own chest.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You don't own a thought in that
                   goddamn head of yours, do you?
                          (a beat)
                   You want to see a man?

      The Postman turns to watch as Ford starts out of camp.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   That's a man.

      The Postman turns, sees Luke's face fraught with confusion
      and emotion.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You don't understand, do you? You
                   never will until you can think for
                   yourself and be willing to pay the
                   price for it.

      Luke stares back into The Postman's eyes.      A frozen beat.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   You ready?

                                   ABBY (O.S.)
                   Yes.

      Abby sits on her horse. She's witness to it all. Luke is
      confused and ashamed. The Postman mounts his horse and
      moves to Abby's side.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You're a better man than
                   Bethlehem, Luke. I've seen it.


139   EXT. RIDGE - R.V. CAMP - DAY                                    139

      Some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire.

      The Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the RV
      camp. They pause to look back one last time. Across the
      way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing. As
      though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back.

      Ford raises his hand, salutes. Slowly, The Postman brings
      up his own hand. But he doesn't salute. He waves. Good-
      bye. As Ford turns away, so does The Postman.


      ON CHUBBY, PONYTAIL AND CARRIER NAMED DREW

      watching as The Postman and Abby disappear from sight.

                                 CHUBBY
                   Guess Minneapolis is that way.


140   EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY                                           140

      A sign prohibits pedestrians, horses and bicycles. The
      Postman and Abby ride by. The Postman no longer wears his
      uniform. Their gear is packed behind their saddles.

      As a family of transients begin to rise from where they're
      camped in the breakdown lane:

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   We can't help you. We're just as
                   lost as you are.

      The Postman rides on. Abby watches over her shoulder as
      they slowly begin to sit back down.


141   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAWN                     141

      Bethlehem sits waiting at his camp table.     Behind him, a
      finished painting.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

      This time he's painted himself in the grand Rococo-style -
      - as part of the Holy Family with doves and flowers and
      glowing rays from Heaven. It's awful.

      Getty and Gibbs bring in a prisoner.       It's Ford!

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Good lord, what do we have here?

                                 FORD
                   I'm a representative of the
                   restored United States --

      Bethlehem backhands Ford.

                                 GIBBS
                   He's got a letter. Says The
                   Postman sent it.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   A letter?

      Bethlehem tears open the letter and starts to read:

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   'Bethlehem. This letter is my
                   testimony to the fact that there
                   is no restored United States and
                   there is no Postal Service.'
                          (laugh; grim)
                   Then who the hell have we been
                   fighting...?
                          (reads on)
                   'My carriers are returning home.
                   In exchange, I'm asking you to let
                   them be. The Postman.'

      Bethlehem eyes Ford with undisguised contempt.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   He expects me to believe this?

                                 LUKE (O.S.)
                   It's true, sir. I was there. He
                   disbanded the carriers and rode
                   west.

      Ford turns blazing eyes to Luke -- he's been standing
      there all along.

                                 FORD
                   Traitor...

      It takes a moment for the news to sink in.      But it does.

                   Then I've won.     I've won.

      As the assembled Holnists congratulate each other,
      Bethlehem looks at Luke.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You were supposed to kill him.

                                 LUKE
                   I couldn't get close enough.
                          (re: Ford)
                   This one's his second in command.

      Bethlehem looks Ford over.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Why doesn't that surprise me?

      Ford stares back.    Proud.     Bethlehem looks to Getty.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Bring out the one we found
                   yesterday. They can die together.

      A frightened CARRIER is brought up. He wears a purple
      uniform with CALI sewn on the shoulder. Neither we nor
      Ford have seen him before. As a firing squad assembles,
      Ford is shoved over with him.

                                    FORD
                   Who are you?

                   the restored Republic of
                   California. Who are you?

      Ford looks at him a second, can't help but laugh.      From
      Gibbs; the shout of "ready!"

                                 FORD

                   It's an honor.

      Bethlehem watches as Clark holds out his hand.      Ford
      shakes it. "Aim!"

                                 BETHLEHEM

142   EXT. RIVER - DAY                                             142

      A pair of boots are walking through the water. It's The
      Postman. He turns over a body in the water. It wears a
      homemade postal uniform, a bag of mail twisted around his
      arm. It's a young face, one we haven't seen before. He
      looks up to Abby on a ridge.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I don't know him. Do you?

                                 ABBY
                          (shakes her head)
                   Where do you think he came from?

      Puzzled, The Postman shakes his head. He gently releases
      the body. The current takes it and they watch as it
      continues on its way to Postal Valhalla.


143   EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY                                        143

      The family of transients are grilled by three Holnist
      scouts. One man points the way Abby and Bethlehem rode.

                                                                 117.

144   EXT. PLAIN - DAY                                                  144

      Littered with rubble. The wood, brick, steel and concrete
      of what was once a small town. Amazingly, one gray house
      still stands, miraculously untouched by whatever disaster
      visited this place.

      A wild-haired SQUATTER steps out on the porch as Abby and
      The Postman ride by. He waves hello with a .45.

                             SQUATTER
                Howdy. Welcome to sunny
                California.

                              THE POSTMAN
                       (re: the town)
                What happened here?

                              SQUATTER
                Little accident. The ground
                started to shake big time and the
                Hanford nuclear plant went...
                       (motions an explosion)
                ... 'Poof.' Destroyed everything
                for miles. But the sunsets are
                beautiful.

                              THE POSTMAN
                You ever hear of a city called St.
                Rose?

                              SQUATTER
                Friend, I've never heard of St.
                Shit.

      The Squatter laughs and laughs -- like it was the funniest
      thing in the world. The Postman and Abby exchange a look,
      continue on their way.

                              SQUATTER
                Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in
                the house! Boardwalk, Park Place
                and the Reading Railroad!

                                                       CUT TO:


145   EXT. EDGE OF RUBBLE - DAY                                         145

      Ponytail, Chubby, and Draw watching from afar.    Chubby has
      the telescope.

                              CHUBBY
                You think that's President
                Starkey?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 118.

145   CONTINUED:                                                        145

      Ponytail takes the telescope from Chubby for a look.

                                 PONYTAIL
                   No.

                                 CHUBBY
                   What makes you so sure?

                                 PONYTAIL
                   President lives in a white house.
                   That guy's place is gray.

      Drew and Chubby exchange a look.       That makes sense.


146   EXT. SKY - DAY                                                    146

      A lightning bolt shreds the sky.       It's day, but the sky is
      black with rain.


147   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWERS - DAY                                    147

      The useless towers cutting across a valley.      Rain beats
      down, as The Postman and Abby trudge along.

      Up ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the
      storm.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (re: the tunnel)
                   We can rest in there.

      Abby is quick to agree.

      Out of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur
      of movement.

      He turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see
      a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing
      from a distant tower. There's a sentry inside it.

      The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading
      straight for an adjacent tower. In a matter of seconds,
      he's lost from view.

      The Postman looks back at Abby.       She's shivering.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Did you see that?

                                 ABBY
                          (shaking her head)
                   I'm hungry, Postman.

      The Postman guides her toward the train tunnel.

                                                              119.

148   INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - DAY                                        148

      Abby sleeps beside the fire. The Postman, silhouetted
      against the flames, heads toward the far tunnel exit.


149   EXT. FAR SIDE OF TUNNEL - DAY                                  149

      The Postman peers into the rain, taking in the view of a
      distant bridge. Abby comes to stand at his side.


150   EXT. COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY                  150

      A town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge. The
      Columbia River rushes far below. A sentry spots Abby and
      The Postman approaching, blows a whistle.

                              GUARD
                Set the rifle on the ground.

                              THE POSTMAN
                This old thing? It isn't even
                loaded. Where are we?

      The BRIDGE CITY MAYOR, a middle-aged retro-hippie, steps
      up.

                              B.C. MAYOR
                You're in Bridge City. Where we
                don't allow guns.

      The Postman sets down the carbine.    The Guard steps over
      to scoop it up.

                              B.C. MAYOR
                Sentry said you were coming.

      The Postman stares at the Mayor a beat.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                I know you.     You're famous.

                              B.C. MAYOR
                I was once. Not anymore.
                       (beat)
                Are you looking to cross?

                              THE POSTMAN
                We will be. Right now, we'd just
                appreciate some food.
                       (as the Mayor
                        nods his assent)
                I got some kids behind me, too.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                120.

150   CONTINUED:                                                       150

                                   B.C. MAYOR
                   How many?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   Three.
                          (as the Mayor
                           agrees once more)
                   Hey, guys, come on in! I know
                   you're out there!

                                 CHUBBY SENTRY
                   Boy, is he smart...

      As they stand, show themselves.


151   EXT. NORTH BOUND LANE (BRIDGE CITY) - DUSK                       151

      Fog rolls in.    Abby rests.

      Ponytail, Chubby and Drew look up gratefully as one of the
      citizens of Bridge City doles out bread.

      The Mayor steps over, hands The Postman two loaves.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   For you and your wife.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   Thanks.    She's not my wife.

      The exchange cuts Abby like a knife. She gets up and
      leaves. The Mayor keeps his council -- not sure what to
      make of this arrangement.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Let me ask you something, have you
                   ever heard of a town with electric
                   lights?

                                   B.C. MAYOR
                   St. Rose?

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   Yeah!

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Never been. But they say it's a
                   ways down on the coast.

                                   THE POSTMAN
                   How far?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                121.

151   CONTINUED:                                                       151

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Couple hundred miles at least.   I
                   couldn't say for sure.

      It's the discovery of a lifetime. The Postman looks to
      the west end of the bridge, where Abby stands alone.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You seem like a decent man. And
                   these seem like decent people.

                                   B.C. MAYOR
                   We try to be.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   And this seems like a safe place.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                          (intuitive)
                   You want to leave her?

      The Postman looks back to the Mayor, then slowly nods.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   All of them. I'll give you the
                   horses and my gear. Abby's
                   special. She's strong. Probably
                   end up running the place.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Why don't you take the night to
                   think. Decide if that's what you
                   really want.


152   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT                                              152

      Fog obscures the east end. A sentry squints at the
      MUFFLED CLOP of HOOVES. The mist parts to reveal, seventy
      yards away: three Holnist scouts on horseback.
      Emissaries from hell.

      As the sentry blows a whistle...


      BRIDGE

      As word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look.
      Eating their bread, The Postman, Abby and the carriers
      join them.

      EAST END

      The Mayor stands across from the lead scout -- conferring.
      Finally, the Mayor points him back the way he came. The
      lead scout doesn't budge, spots The Postman in the crowd.

      He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever.
      Then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. The other two
      follow. Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. The
      Postman's head swims dizzily. It's not over.

      The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   They're looking for The Postman.

                                 B.C. MAN
                   No such thing anymore.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Man on the horse says there is.
                   Says he thinks he's here. Says
                   he's coming back with friends.

      A little BOY steps forward, sings out.

                                 B.C. BOY
                   What's a postman?

      A silent moment. It's been so long, no one's sure how to
      answer. The Postman looks down at the ground. The
      carriers exchange deflated looks. Then...

                                 ABBY
                          (stepping forward)
                   You never heard of a postman?

      He shakes his head "no." Seems a shame. As The Postman
      looks over at Abby, she takes a page from his book.

                                 ABBY
                   There used to be a postman for
                   every street in America. They
                   wore uniforms. And hats. Like
                   this one...

      She goes to The Postman's gear, returns with his postal
      cap. Sets it on the boy's head.

                                 B.C. BOY
                   Wow...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                123.

152   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                152

                                 ABBY
                   My postman knew the name of every
                   kid on my street. He knew our
                   birthdays. He'd even find the
                   baseballs you'd hit down the
                   street. I can still see the smile
                   on his face. The tip of his cap
                   -- when he had a letter in his bag
                   with my name on it. Mine always
                   came just after school. You could
                   set your watch by him. Unless you
                   were waiting on something special
                   -- like a present from somewhere
                   far away or a letter from your
                   sweetheart. Then it seemed like
                   he'd never come. I used to think
                   they could make time stand still.

      Several other listeners nod -- they're completely with
      her.

                                 ABBY
                   I don't think we ever really
                   understood what they meant to us
                   until they were gone. Getting a
                   letter made you feel like you were
                   part of something bigger than
                   yourself. No place was ever too
                   far away for the postman. So
                   nobody ever had to be alone. The
                   postman was someone you could
                   count on. Things just made more
                   sense when they were around.
                          (beat)
                   That's the kind of world we used
                   to have. A world a lot of us took
                   for granted. And now we've got
                   this one. And it makes me
                   wonder -- what kind of world do I
                   want my child to live in? I want
                   my child to live in a world where
                   hopes and dreams aren't just lies
                   you tell yourself to get through
                   another day. I want my child, and
                   I want my friends -- I want all of
                   us to live in a world where you
                   still get your mail.

      It's a   moment before anyone speaks.

      The Postman takes the cap off the little boy's head,
      touches the emblem, and answers.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Yes.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   I've heard of you, man. You're
                   famous.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a
                   sudden, I'm not wearing the right
                   clothes.

      And as he puts on his cap, he accepts the mantle as well.

      lowered from the top of the bridge. Hands reach up to
      steady it and bring it gently to the ground. It's one of
      many.

      The Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to
      reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo.
      The Postman blinks over at the Mayor.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Fact that we don't allow 'em
                   doesn't mean we don't have 'em.
                   We're not stupid, after all.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I'm sorry I've brought this on
                   you.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   No need to be sorry. Long as we
                   get our mail on time.

                                 PONYTAIL (O.S.)
                   Ready for duty, sir.

      The Postman looks over to see Ponytail, Drew and Chubby
      ride up. Like him, they are back in uniform.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   The order was to burn all
                   uniforms.

      The carriers look away -- sheepish.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   You know what to do then?

                                 PONYTAIL
                   Talk to the people. Gather who's
                   willing. Tell them it's
                   important. Tell them we can make
                   a difference.

                                 CHUBBY SENTRY
                   And tell 'em we're going to kick
                   ass.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Yeah, tell them that, too.

      At the edge of the Gorge. The three carriers, and the
      mounted locals thunder off the bridge and down the road.
      High above...


155   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWER - POSTMAN AND ABBY                         155

      The Mayor is in the b.g. helping one of the sentries
      prepare the basket for travel.

                                 ABBY
                   This is hard for me.
                          (beat)
                   Michael was the best man I ever
                   knew. I never thought there'd be
                   another man I could love the way I
                   loved him.
                          (searching for
                           the words)
                   I don't know why I've been so
                   blessed. And I've tried to find a
                   way to be thankful, but I swear,
                   if I lose you...

      Her eyes start to tear and he takes her in his arms.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   Abby, do you think a lie can
                   become the truth?

                                 ABBY
                   I don't know, but I believe in
                   you. You have a gift, Postman.     I
                   saw it back in Pine View.

                   You made Mrs. March feel like she
                   could see again. You made Ford
                   feel like he was part of the
                   world. You give out hope like it
                   was candy in your pocket.

      He starts to speak.    She stops him, taking his hand.

                                 ABBY
                   When you come back, we'll be
                   waiting here for you. So you can
                   take us to St. Rose.

      The Postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket.

      The Mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into
      the distance.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   There's three good-sized towns up
                   that way. Enough folks to be a
                   big help to you. If you can
                   convince them to come.

      As The Postman steps into the basket, he makes the mistake
      of looking over the edge. It's a long, long way down.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   A lot higher than it looks, huh?

      The Postman looks at the contraption with more than a
      little trepidation. The Mayor grins.

                                  B.C. MAYOR
                   Don't tell anybody, but I like to
                   ride the damn thing just for the
                   hell of it. Being a city official
                   has its perks.

      He winks and as he reaches for the release pin.     The
      Postman's hand meets his there.

                                 B.C. MAYOR
                   Trust me, man. This'll get you
                   there a lot faster.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   How do I stop --

      But it's too late.    The Mayor releases the pin.

      The town's gone, but the palisade remains. Chubby rides
      along it, exhorting the people who watch from above. But
      it's The Postman we hear, all the magic back in his voice.

                                 THE POSTMAN (V.O.)
                   Once more into the breach, dear
                   friends, once more. Or close the
                   wall with our dead. In peace
                   nothing so becomes a man as
                   modesty and humility. But when
                   the blast of war blows in our
                   ears, then imitate the action of
                   the tiger.

      A few makeshift structures are back up. Carrying a torch,
      Ponytail gallops hard into town. People wake, including
      Mrs. March's daughter. As Ponytail speaks to them...

                   Summon up the blood. Disguise
                   fair nature with rage and lend the
                   eye a terrible aspect.


158   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                                 158

      Captured by a Holnist cavalry patrol, Old George and four
      other carriers are lined up, hands bound before them.
      Holnist soldiers force them to their knees as Gibbs
      organizes an impromptu firing squad.

      Old George looks down the line.    The carriers are about to
      break down.

                                 OLD GEORGE
                   Steady, boys, steady.

      And as Gibbs steps up, all hope is gone.

                                 GIBBS
                   In accordance with Law Eight...

                   sonuvabitch!

      We see the faces of the young carriers. Defeated, bitter.
      But there's a sudden spark in Old George's eyes. He
      starts to rise.

      The soldiers pick up their guns and that's when they see
      The Postman.


      THE POSTMAN

      Riding over the crest. Galloping toward them. Behind
      him, forty new mail carriers. All riding like mad. One
      of them carries the flag of the restored United States.

      Gibbs and his men run for their horses. SHOTS are FIRED.
      Four Holnists go down. The rest gallop away.

      The Postman and his carriers meet.

      Converging. The Postman with his forty-five coming from
      the west. Drew, Chubby, and a ragtag thirty coming from
      the north. And from the south, Ponytail leading a
      contingent of fifty!

      The forces converge and continue east.

      The army has gathered.    Three hundred strong.

      Bethlehem and Getty stand outside the command tent,
      listening to a winded, frightened Gibbs. We FOLLOW
      Bethlehem's eyes OVER Gibbs' SHOULDERS TO the horizon,
      where he sees: The Postman and his army of two hundred
      carriers cresting a distant rise.

      approaching army. He reaches out -- Getty hands him a
      pair of binoculars.

                   one who can't count. Lieutenant,
                   do yourself a favor. Die well in
                   this battle. In my army a
                   deserter's life is a brief and
                   unpleasant one.

      Bethlehem watches The Postman through the binoculars -- a
      hint of a smile on his face.

                   At last, someone with courage
                   enough to bring the fight to me.

      A Holnist soldier stands by with Bethlehem's horse.   The
      General mounts -- the model of military calm and
      precision. Getty reins up beside him.

                                 BETHLEHEM

      A sea of wildflowers separates the carriers from the
      Holnists. The monster John Deere gun is ready for battle.

      his binoculars. The carriers look, just spoiling for a
      fight. Bethlehem lowers his binoculars, smiles grimly.

                              BETHLEHEM
                They're an eager-looking bunch.
                Morale's a dangerous thing.
                       (to Getty)

                to see how the game is played.


163   EXT. CARRIERS' LINE - DAY                                      163

      The Postman, Chubby, Ponytail and Old George and all the
      carriers have taken positions.

      The Postman sights through a telescope.

      He scans further down the line -- then stops when he sees
      Ford. Bloody, beaten within inches of his life. He's
      shackled -- surrounded by Holnist guards.

      The Postman's eyes turn to stone.

                              THE POSTMAN
                       (to carriers)
                Stay here. No one moves until I
                give the orders.

      He clicks his horse forward, toward the Holnist line.


164   EXT. HOLNIST LINE - DAY                                        164

      Bethlehem, flanked by Getty and the Holnist Sergeant,
      watches as The Postman makes his approach. He reaches
      into his pocket, withdraws a white kerchief and holds it
      in the air.

                              SERGEANT
                Are they surrendering?

                              BETHLEHEM
                God, I hope not.

      He watches for a moment as The Postman crosses the field -
      - moving well within range of Holnist fire. Then, he
      coaxes his horse forward.

                                                              131.

165   EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                              165

      Bethlehem and The Postman riding toward each other. They
      meet when The Postman is almost three-quarters of the way
      over to the Holnists' side.


      BETHLEHEM AND POSTMAN

      As they come face-to-face.

                              BETHLEHEM
                My little shipping clerk.

                              THE POSTMAN
                We're both a couple of frauds.
                You know it; I know it.

      Bethlehem sneers.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Great men are made by other great
                men. Patton had Rommel. Grant
                had Lee. But I get you.

                              THE   POSTMAN
                You're no fucking   general. You're
                a copying machine   salesman.
                You're not even a   good painter.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Are you trying to goad me into a
                fight?

                              THE POSTMAN
                Wouldn't it be great if wars could
                be fought just by the assholes who
                started them? We could settle
                this thing right here. You and
                me.

                              BETHLEHEM
                Unfortunately, it doesn't work
                that way.

                              THE POSTMAN
                It does in your army.

      The Postman kicks his horse up into a gallop, and rides up
      the Holnist line. No one, least of all Bethlehem, is sure
      what's going on.

                              THE POSTMAN
                I invoke law seven of the Laws of
                Eight! Any man may challenge for
                leadership of the clan!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               132.

165   CONTINUED:                                                      165

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   What?

      The Postman wheels his horse around.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I challenge you.

      Bethlehem is caught completely by surprise, but recovers.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You're not a Holnist. You're not
                   a member of the clan. You don't
                   have the right.

      The Postman rolls up his sleeve. He rides the Holnist
      lines displaying his brand for all to see. The Holnists
      murmur amongst themselves.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I have every right. I invoke law
                   seven!

      Bethlehem can't believe his eyes.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I challenge for leadership of the
                   clan!

      The seed of doubt is planted. Is Bethlehem violating one
      of the Laws of Eight? The men look at one another. Gibbs
      looks to Getty. Bethlehem looks from The Postman's tattoo
      to his face.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Where do I know you from?

                                THE POSTMAN
                   'Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs
                   of war.' Remember that?

                                  BETHLEHEM
                   Shakespeare. The one who didn't
                   want to fight.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   I should've found a way to kill
                   you then. But you seemed so
                   strong.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Law seven it is.
                          (to all)
                   This war is settled here!

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 133.

      As The Postman nods in agreement.

      They take their positions -- and without a word -- they
      kick their horses into a charge. Coming straight for each
      other like medieval jousters.

      Bethlehem reaches for his sword.    But before it clears the
      scabbard, The Postman lunges.

      The horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the
      ground hard.

      Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a
      better look.

      The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem
      are at each other like coiled snakes.

      It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists --
      especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in
      tighter.

      Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they
      fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.

      One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his
      footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock
      with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise.

      It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the
      fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand --
      grabs The Postman's throat with the other.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   I study people. I know your
                   problem. Do you know why you
                   can't fight?

      The Postman can't answer.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   You have nothing to fight for.
                   You don't care about anything.
                   You don't value anything. You
                   don't believe in anything. That's
                   what makes me better.

      The Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his
      remaining strength to keep him at bay.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                          (barely audible)
                   I believe in the United States
                   Postal Service.

      The Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt
      and pulls him over. As they roll to their feet, The
      Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head.

                                  THE POSTMAN
                   Neither snow...
                          (wham!)
                   Nor rain...

                          (wham!)
                   Will stay this courier from the
                   swift completion of his appointed
                   rounds...

      Bethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on
      top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to
      pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to
      die.

      The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists.
      Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the
      faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps
      for breath.

      As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The
      Postman looks to both sides.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   It doesn't have to be this way.
                   We don't have to kill each other.
                   We can live together. We can --

      Ford takes Chubby's pistol, sets it against the side of
      Bethlehem's head.

                                  FORD
                   Law three.   Mercy is for the weak.

                                    THE POSTMAN
                   Ford, don't...

      Bethlehem shakes his head -- doesn't want him to, either.

                                 FORD
                   Law eight. There is only one
                   penalty and that penalty is death.

      Ford's going to shoot.

                                 THE POSTMAN
                   He isn't worth it. I'm the head

      The Postman nods solemnly, looks to Ford.

                   How about it, Ford Lincoln
                   Mercury? You give us law eight.

      Ford grits his teeth.

      Ford has fired into the ground.

      The Postman smiles in relief as Ford lowers the revolver
      and starts to hand the weapon over.

      Forgotten for an instant, Bethlehem makes a last, wild
      lunge, grabs Ford's gun.

      As Bethlehem aims at The Postman, a SHOT rings out. Hit
      in the chest, Bethlehem blinks in amazement before he
      falls to the ground, dying. Getty has shot him.

                                 BETHLEHEM
                   Would I had bestowed that time in
                   the tongues that I have in
                   fencing, dancing and bear-baiting.
                   Oh, had I but followed the arts...

      He dies.

                   will -- that nothing do but
                   mediate on blood.

      Getty throws his rifle on the ground. Other weapons are
      laid down. The war, at long last, is over.

      Abby, in bed, holding her new baby in her arms. She's
      reading a letter. What she reads makes her smile. She
      puts the letter down and cuddles her baby.

      Abby looks up to see The Postman standing at her door.
      She looks at him, smiling with tears in her eyes.

                   Your daughter.     Her name is Hope.

      The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                   And so my father returned home
                   after the Holnists were
                   defeated...


167   EXT. ST. ROSE - DAY                                                167

      A beach town. No wall, no sentries, just cottages lining
      a dozen sand-swept streets. A crowd has gathered to hear
      The Postman's daughter, HOPE, mid-thirties, speak. Beside
      her, a bearded, 52-year-old Ford in his postmaster's
      uniform. They stand before a large, tarp-draped statue.

                                 HOPE
                   But he never did see St. Rose.
                   There was too much to be done.
                   He'd made a promise and in keeping
                   it -- he traded one dream for
                   another. With no regrets. And
                   so, in honor of my father...

      She unveils the statue: we've seen this before. It's The
      Postman on his horse, low-slung in the saddle, leaning
      down to pluck the letter from the Little Boy's hand.

      There's an OLDER MAN in the audience who seems especially
      moved by the statue. There's a younger man beside him.

                                    OLDER MAN
                   That was me.

      As St. Rose applauds...


                                                          FADE OUT.




                                    THE END
