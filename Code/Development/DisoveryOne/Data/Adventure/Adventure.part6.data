1   EXT. PONDICHERRY ZOO, INDIA, 1961 - DAY                      1

    CREDITS OVER: a magical fairy tale world in collage - images
    of fantastic creatures striped and spotted, hoofed and
    horned.

    Goats and warthogs mingle in an open field; a baby giraffe
    tries to reach leaves over a fence; rhinos roll happily in
    rich red mud, looking like giant muddy boulders, while
    nearby, black and white Malayan tapirs cool themselves in
    watering holes.

    Exotic monkeys with comical faces cling lovingly to one
    another, swing from trees, climb over one another, prance and
    screech; a probiscus monkey with a 'Jimmy Durante' nose
    pointing out through the plane of the screen. Flamingoes
    strut about in the aviary, their pink feathers reflected in
    the water.

    A sloth droops lazily from a tree branch, unfazed, while a
    nearby hummingbird zips manically from flower to flower like
    Tinkerbell...

    ... the Pondicherry zoo is a children's paradise nestled in a
    botanical garden.

                        WRITER (V.O.)
              You were raised in a zoo?


3   EXT. PONDICHERRY ZOO, INDIA, 1961 - DAY                      3

    There's a flurry of activity in the animal clinic behind a
    monitor lizard that wanders the main path. ZOO WORKERS gather
    in the doorway, talking excitedly.

    No one notices the lizard.

                        ADULT PI (V.O.)
              Born and raised in Pondicherry, in
              what was the French part of India.
              My father owned the zoo, and I was
              delivered on short notice by a
              herpetologist who was there to
              check on the Bengal Monitor Lizard.

    The zoo owner (FATHER - late 20s) hurries down the path as
    quickly as his heavy leg brace will allow and hurries into
    the animal clinic.
                                                             2.


                        ADULT PI (V.O.)
              Mother and I were both healthy...

    The lizard crawls away.

                        ADULT PI (V.O.)
              but the poor lizard escaped and was
              trampled by a frightened
              cassowary...


5   INT. PI'S HOME, KITCHEN, MONTREAL - DAY                       5

    A modest row house. There is a French influence to the decor,
    along with books and artwork that celebrate the spiritual.

    PI PATEL (50 - intelligent, Indo-Canadian) cooks an Indian
    meal. The often-skeptical WRITER (late 30s, a disheveled
    French Canadian), watches Pi.

                        ADULT PI
              The way of karma; the way of God.

                        WRITER
              I assumed your father was a
              mathematician - because of your
              name.

                        ADULT PI
              Oh, far from it. I was named after
              a swimming pool.

                        WRITER
              There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?'

                        ADULT PI
                  (He chuckles.)
              You see, my uncle, Francis, was
              born with too much water in his
              lungs. They say the doctor swung
              Francis around by the ankles to
              clear the water out and that's what
              gave him the huge chest and skinny
              legs that made him such a great
              swimmer.

                        WRITER
                  (Amused.)
              Is Francis actually your uncle? He
              said he was friends with your
              father.
                                                             3.


                        PI
              I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary
              uncle' - my father's best friend,
              my swimming guru.


6   EXT. ASHRAM SWIMMING POOL, PONDICHERRY, 1966 - DAY            6

                        ADULT PI (V.O.)
              I trained with him three times a
              week at the ashram. His lessons
              would save my life in the end...

    A young Indian boy - PI AT AGE FIVE - surfaces from a pool,
    gasping. He looks up at the large chest and skinny legs of
    Mamaji (late 30s). Mamaji reaches down to scoop Pi out of the
    water.

                        MAMAJI
              A mouthful of water will not harm
              you - but panic will.

    Mamaji carries Pi back over to the water's edge.

                        MAMAJI (CONT'D)
              Remember to breathe. Don't hold
              your breath. Good boy.

    Mamaji unceremoniously tosses Pi back in.


7   INT. PI'S HOME, KITCHEN, MONTREAL - DAY                       7

                        ADULT PI
                  (Regarding lunch:)
              I hope you don't mind vegetarian.

                        WRITER
              No, not at all... And your name?

                        ADULT PI
              Hmm?

                        WRITER
              You - you were going to tell me how
              you got your name, I think.

                        ADULT PI
              I got it from something Mamaji once
              told my father. Most travelers
              collect postcards or teacups on
              their journeys - but not Mamaji.
              Mamaji collects swimming pools.

                                                              4.

                         ADULT PI (CONT'D)
               He swims in every pool he comes
               upon...


8    EXT. THE PISCINE MOLITOR, PARIS, 1959 - DAY                   8

     Mamaji stands admiring the Piscine Molitor, a pool of
     sparkling magnificence. Attractive French men and women in
     bathing suits, the setting a celebration of idealized beauty.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               One day Mamaji said to my father
               that of all the pools in the world,
               the most beautiful was a public
               pool in Paris. That the water there
               was so clear you could make your
               morning coffee with it, that a
               single swim there changed his life.

     Mamaji dives into the crystal clear water - and we follow,
     taking in the divine miracle of his underwater journey across
     the pool.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Before I was born, he said to my
               father, "If you want your son to
               have a clean soul, you must take
               him one day to swim in the Piscine
               Molitor." I never understood why my
               father took this so much to
               heart...


9    INT. PI'S HOME, MONTREAL - DAY                                9

                         ADULT PI
               ... but he did, and I was named
               "Piscine Molitor Patel."


10   EXT. PI'S PRIMARY SCHOOL, 1972 - DAY                         10

     PI (AGE 11) leans against the railing of a balcony, reading
     "L'Ile Mysterieuse (The Mysterious Island)" by Jules Verne.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Imagine me trying to explain that
               name to my schoolmates. I barely
               made it to the age of eleven
               before...

     A boy (BULLY #1) calls up to him from the courtyard below.
                                                                5.


                         BULLY #1
               Hey PISCINE!

     Pi glances down, all the boys in the courtyard watching him.

                         BULLY #1 (CONT'D)
               Are you Pissing right now?

     Pi freezes. The other boys laugh uncontrollably.

                         ANOTHER BOY
               Look at him he's Pissing!

                         ADULT PI (VO)
               With one word my name went from an
               elegant French swimming pool to a
               stinking Indian latrine. I was
               Pissing everywhere.


11   I/E. SCHOOLYARD, 1972 - DAY                                 11

     BOYS in school uniform kick a ball. Pi attempts to join.
     Bully #2 intercepts the pass.

                         BULLY #2
               No Pissing in the schoolyard!

12   INT. SCIENCE CLASS, 1972 - DAY                              12

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Even the teachers started doing it -
               not deliberately, of course...

                         SCIENCE TEACHER
               So then - what might occur if we
               release gas too quickly? Pissing?

     Pi is aghast. Several students splutter and howl, whispering
     the slip to others. Laughter ripples around the room, all
     eyes on Pi.

                         BOY
               He said Pissing!

                         SCIENCE TEACHER
               That's enough - order!

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               When we returned the next year for
               our first day of school, I was
               prepared.
                                                        6.


SC. 13 INT. INDIAN HISTORY CLASS, 1973 - DAY 13

Class is held in a large open room. Roll call.

                    BOY
          Present sir.

                    HISTORY TEACHER
          Piscine Patel...

PI - AGE 12, rises, crosses to the front.

                    PI (AT 12)
          Good morning. I am Piscine Molitor
          Patel, known to all as...
              (He writes "PI" on the
               board.)
          ... "Pi," the sixteenth letter of
          the Greek alphabet...

Pi writes , then quickly charts out a general notion of the
concept on the chalkboard.

                    PI (CONT'D)
          ... which is also used in
          mathematics to represent the ratio
          of any circle's circumference to
          its diameter - an irrational number
          of infinite length, usually rounded
          to three digits, as...
              (He writes "3.14.")
          3.14. PI.

Pi underlines his name, faces the class.

                    HISTORY TEACHER
          Very impressive, Pi. Now sit down.

                    WRITER (V.O.)
          And from then on you were Pi?

                    ADULT PI (V.O.)
          Well, no. Not quite ...

As Pi returns to his seat, Bully #2 leans forward,
whispering:

                    BULLY #2
          Nice try, Pissing.

                    ADULT PI (V.O.)
          But I still had the whole day ahead
          of me. French Class was next...
                                                                 7.


14   INT. FRENCH CLASS, 1973 - DAY                                14

     Pi repeats his act in French, 3.14159265 on the board.

                          PI (12)
               Je m'appelle Piscine Molitor Patel -
               dit'Pi'...

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Then Geography...


15   EXT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS, 1973 - DAY                             15

     Class is held out of doors in a courtyard. Pi, at a portable
     chalkboard, writes and says: 3.14159265358979323846.

                         PI (12)
               These are the first twenty decimal
               places of Pi.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               My last class of the day was
               Mathematics....


16   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, 1973 - DAY                              16

     A LIBRARIAN runs down the hall, a huge book tucked under his
     arm, followed by dozens of students. He reaches Pi's class,
     pushes his way through the crowd.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Slowly, Slowly! Slowly, Slowly!


17   INT. MATH CLASS, 1973 - CONTINUOUS                           17

     Close on Pi writing digits. Pull back - the entire chalkboard
     is filled with numbers. All watching are stunned. The
     librarian compares Pi's writing to the math book.

                         LIBRARIAN
               It is right... He's really doing
               this!

     Students clap and cheer - even the bullies. Several chant
     along with him as he writes:

                         ALL
               1! 4! 9! 3! 1! PI! PI! PI!
                                                          8.


                         ADULT PI (VO)
               By the end of that day, I was Pi
               Patel, school legend.


18   INT. PI'S KITCHEN - DAY                               18

     The writer laughs, then ventures onto a new topic.

                         WRITER
               Mamaji tells me you're a legend
               among sailors, too. Out there all
               alone -

                         ADULT PI
               I don't even know how to sail. And
               I wasn't alone out there. Richard
               Parker was with me.

                         WRITER
               Richard Parker...? Mamaji didn't
               tell me everything. He just said I
               should look you up when I got back
               to Montreal.

                         ADULT PI
               So what were you doing in
               Pondicherry?

                         WRITER
               Writing a novel.

                         ADULT PI
               By the way, I enjoyed your first
               book. The new one, is it set in
               India?

                         WRITER
               No, Portugal, actually. But it's
               cheaper living in India.

                         ADULT PI
               Ah. Well, I look forward to reading
               it.

                         WRITER
               You can't. I threw it out. Two
               years trying to bring it to life,
               and then one day it sputtered,
               coughed, and died.

                            ADULT PI
               I'm sorry.
                                              9.


          WRITER
    (Shrugs, making light of
     it.)
I was in a coffee house in
Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning
my loss, when this old man at the
next table struck up a
conversation.

          ADULT PI
Yeah, Mamaji. He does that.

          WRITER
When I told him about my abandoned
book, he said:
    (Imitating Mamaji:)
"So... a Canadian who's come to
French India in search of a story.
Well, my friend, I know an Indian
in French Canada who has the most
incredible story to tell. It must
be fate that the two of you should
meet."

          ADULT PI
I haven't spoken about Richard
Parker in so many years... What has
Mamaji already told you?

          WRITER
He said you had a story that would
make me believe in God.

          ADULT PI
    (Pi laughs.)
He would say that about a nice
meal. As for God, I can only tell
you my story; you will decide for
yourself what you believe.

          WRITER
Fair enough.

          ADULT PI
Let's see, then - where to begin?

                                CUT TO: MONTAGE
                                OF PONDICHERRY,
                                          1954:
                                                                10.


19   EXT. PONDICHERRY, SHORELINE 1954 - DAY                       19

     - The SHORELINE - Bicycles and pedestrians; policemen in
     round, flat-top French hats.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Pondicherry is the "French Riviera
               of India." In the streets closest
               to the ocean, you might think you
               were in the South of France.


20   EXT. ASHRAM STREET, 1954 - DAY                               20

     - Grey ASHRAM buildings, which give way to images of...


21   EXT. PONDICHERRY CANAL, 1954 - DAY                           21

     - The CANAL, and just beyond it, INDIAN PONDI.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               A few blocks inland, there's a
               canal; just beyond that is Indian
               Pondicherry...


     SC. 22 EXT. PONDICHERRY MUSLIM QUARTER, 1954 - DAY 22

     - The MUSLIM QUARTER, women in head scarves pass men baking
     flatbread over coals, the mosque in the background.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               And the Muslim Quarter is just to
               the West.


18   INT. PI'S HOME - CONTINUED                                   18

                         ADULT PI
               When the French handed Pondicherry
               back to us in 1954, the town
               decided that some sort of
               commemoration was in order.


25   EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE, 1955 - DAY                                25

     The sign on the gate reads: "JARDIN BOTANIQUE DE
     PONDICHERRY."

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               My father, who was a clever
               businessman, came up with one.

                                                                11.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               He ran a hotel, and he got the idea
               to open a zoo in the local
               Botanical Gardens instead.

     Father oversees a SIGN PAINTER as the painter who adds the
     words 'AND ZOO' to the sign.


26   EXT. THE NURSERY - CONTINUOUS                                26

     WOMEN WORKERS plant and dig in the Botanical Gardens nursery.
     As MOTHER (refined - 20's) passes by, she admonishes a worker
     who pulls up a sapling with too much force.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               As it also happened, my mother was
               a botanist in the Gardens. They
               met, married, and a year later my
               brother Ravi was born. I came two
               years after that.


27   INT. PI'S HOME, OUTER ROOM, MONTREAL - DAY                   27

                         WRITER
               It sounds magical, growing up in-

     The Writer stops, realizing that Pi's eyes are closed in
     prayer. The Writer watches in awkward silence, his head
     halfbowed.

                         ADULT PI
               Amen. Let's eat.

                         WRITER
               I didn't know Hindus said 'amen.'

                         ADULT PI
                   (As he serves food:)
               Catholic Hindus do.

                         WRITER
               Catholic Hindus?

                         ADULT PI
               We get to feel guilty before
               hundreds of gods instead of just
               one.

                         WRITER
               But you're a Hindu first?
                                                             12.


                         PI
               None of us knows God    until someone
               introduces us. I was    first
               introduced to God as    a Hindu. There
               are 330 million gods    in the Hindu
               religion - how can I    not come to
               know a few of them?


28   EXT. OUTSIDE THE PATEL HOME, 1966 - NIGHT                 28

     YOUNG PI (5) and Ravi listen to Mother quietly singing a
     gentle tune as she kneels before their home, using rice
     powder to draw a Kolam pattern - a geometric design meant to
     bring the home prosperity.

                         PI (V.O.)
               I met Krishna first...

                         MOTHER (V.O., IN TAMIL)
               Yashoda once accused baby Krishna
               of eating dirt: "Tut, tut, you
               naughty boy - you shouldn't do
               that..."


29   INT. PI'S BEDROOM, 1966 - NIGHT                           29

     It is raining outside. Pan from the window; Mother lies in
     bed with Pi as they continue sharing this story for the
     thousandth time. Mother's voice plays over (Note: they speak
     in Tamil throughout the following dialogue):

                         PI
               ...But he didn't!

                         MOTHER
               That's what he told her. "I didn't
               eat dirt!" "No? Well, then open
               your mouth." So Krishna opened his
               mouth.

     Pi opens his mouth in imitation.

                         MOTHER (TAMIL) (CONT'D)
               And what do you think Yashoda saw?

                         PI (TAMIL)
               What?

                         MOTHER (TAMIL)
               She saw in Krishna's mouth the
               whole entire universe.
                                                             13.


30   PI AND RAVI'S BEDROOM, 1966 - NIGHT                          30

     Pi has made a tent of his blanket, a flashlight glowing
     beneath the covers. In his tent, Pi flips through the pages
     of a Hindu comic book, enthralled by the story of Krishna...

     The panels of the comic book show Krishna's mouth falling
     open, revealing stars and planets, the universe unfolding in
     wondrous detail.


34   PONDI TEMPLE COURTYARD, 1966 - NIGHT                         34

     A tank ceremony is about to begin. The tank is a square
     reservoir the size of a soccer field; Pi's family sits among
     the crowd on the steps that lead down to the water.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               The gods were my superheroes
               growing up. Hanuman, the monkey
               god, lifting an entire mountain to
               save his friend Lakshmana. Ganesh,
               the elephantheaded, risking his
               life to defend the honor of his
               mother Parvati. Vishnu, the Supreme
               Soul, the source of all things.
               Vishnu sleeps, floating on the
               shoreless cosmic ocean and we are
               the stuff of his dreaming.

                         FATHER
                   (With quiet sincerity.)
               Spectacle. Don't let the stories
               and pretty lights fool you, boys.
               Religion is darkness.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               My dear 'Appa' believed himself
               part of the 'new India.' As a
               child, he'd had polio; he used to
               lie in bed, wracked with pain,
               wondering where God was. In the
               end, God didn't save him; Western
               medicine did.

     Below, Mother watches the ceremony, lost in contemplation.
                                                             14.


                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               My 'Amma' went to college and
               thought her family was part of the
               'new India' as well - until her
               parents cut her off because they
               thought she was marrying beneath
               her. Her religion was the only link
               she had to her past.


36   EXT. MUNNAR TEA FIELDS, 1973 - DAY                           36

     Rocky mountaintops jut up through a sea of clouds and mist.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               I met Christ in the mountains when
               I was 12. We were visiting
               relatives, tea growers in Munnar.
               It was our third day there; Ravi
               and I were terribly bored.

     Ravi walks up to Pi, coins in hand, and whispers.

                         RAVI (14)
               Challenge. I'll give you two
               rupees. Run into that church and
               drink the Holy water.


37   INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH, 1973 - DAY                             37

     Pi leans down to the font beside the door and drinks. He's
     about to leave again when he notices the stations of the
     cross depicted on plaques that encircle the church.

                         PRIEST
               You must be thirsty. Here, I
               brought you this.

     Not knowing what else to do, Pi takes the glass and drinks.
     An awkward pause as he searches for something - anything - to
     say. He finally points up to one of the paintings.

                         PI
               Why would a god do that? Why would
               he send his own son to suffer for
               the sins of ordinary people?

     The Priest smiles down upon Pi.

                         PRIEST
               Because He loves us. God made
               Himself approachable to us - human -
               so we could understand Him.
                         (MORE)
                                                              15.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
               We can't understand God in all His
               perfection, but we can understand
               God's son and His suffering as we
               would a brother's.


38   INT. PI'S DINING ROOM, MONTREAL - INTERCUT/CONTINUOUS      38

                         ADULT PI
               That made no sense. Sacrificing the
               innocent to atone for the sins of
               the guilty? What kind of love is
               that?


39   EXT. PLANTATION HOME, MUNNAR, 1973 - DAY                   39

     Ravi and other kids play cricket. Pi sits by a stream, lost
     in thought.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               But this Son - I couldn't get Him
               out of my head.


41   INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH, MUNNAR, 1973 - DAY 41                41

     Pi stands quizzing the priest near the altar.

                         PI
               If God is so perfect and we're not,
               why would He want to create all
               this? Why does He need us at all?

                          PRIEST
               All you have to know is that He
               loves us. "God so loved the world
               that He gave His only Son." This
               Son taught us to love one
               another...

     The priest's words continue as Pi leans in, listening.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               The more I listened to the priest,
               the more I came to like this Son of
               God.


42   INT. PI'S BEDROOM, 1973 - DAY                              42

     Pi kneels, smiling, in an attitude of worship.
                                                              16.


                          PI
                Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing
                me to Christ.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                I came to faith through Hinduism
                and I found God's love through
                Christ, but God wasn't finished
                with me yet.


43    EXT. MUSLIM QUARTER, 1973 - DAY                             43

      As Pi wanders through the Muslim Quarter, the call to prayer
      plays out over a loudspeaker affixed to the nearby mosque. Pi
      watches as people pray.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                God works in mysterious ways - and
                so it was He introduced Himself
                again, this time by the name of
                Allah.

      Pi crosses inquisitively up the few steps of a mosque in the
      Muslim quarter, looking inside, where dozens of the FAITHFUL
      are lined up row upon row, praying.


A43   EXT. PONDICHERRY MOSQUE, 1973 - DAY                         A43

      The speaker on top of the mosque plays the Muslim call to
      prayer.


44    INT. PI FAMILY HOME, 1973 - DAY                             44

      Pi is out in front of the house kneeling on a prayer mat,
      repeating a prayer. Father passes by with friends. He stops
      to watch Pi.


45    INT. FAMILY KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, 1973 - DUSK                45

      Father sits at the dinner table with his family. The servant
      offers a dish of lamb to Father only. Father pops a bite into
      his mouth, savoring it.

                          FATHER
                This lamb is exquisite - it's best
                dish on the table. You are all
                missing out...

      As he chews, Father notices Pi completing a blessing.
                                      17.


          FATHER (CONT'D)
You only need to convert to three
more religions, Piscine, and you
will spend your life on holiday.

          RAVI
    (Laughing:)
Are you going to Mecca this year,
Swami Jesus? Or to Rome, for your
coronation as Pope Pi-us?

           MOTHER
You stay out of this, Ravi. Just as
you like cricket, Pi has his own
interests.

          FATHER
No Gita, Ravi has a point, no? You
cannot follow three different
religions at the same time,
Piscine.

           PI
Why not?

          FATHER
Because believing in everything at
the same time is the same as not
believing in anything at all.

          MOTHER
He's young Santosh - he's still
finding his way.

          FATHER
And how can he find his way if he
does not choose a path?
    (To Pi:)
Listen: instead of leaping from one
religion to the next, why not start
with reason? In a few hundred
years, science has taken us farther
in understanding the universe than
religion has in ten thousand.

          MOTHER
That is true. Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about
what's out there -
    (With a hand to her
     heart:)
- but not what is in here. Art,
music, literature - they all spring
from our faith.
                                                             18.


                          FATHER
                Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.
                I do not expect us all to agree
                about everything. But I would much
                rather have you believe in
                something I don't agree with than
                to accept everything blindly. And
                that begins with thinking
                rationally. Do you understand?

     Pi nods.

                          FATHER (CONT'D)
                Good.

     Pause.

                          PI
                I would like to be baptized.

     Father and Mother react. Ravi stifles a laugh.


46   EXT. PI'S STREET - DAY                                    46

     Pi walks down the front steps of his row house, stretching
     and rubbing his belly at the end of a good meal. The writer
     follows.

                          WRITER
                So you're a Christian and a Muslim?

                          ADULT PI
                And a Hindu, of course.

                          WRITER
                And a Jew, I suppose?

                          ADULT PI
                Oh, well, I do teach a course on
                the Kabbalah at the University. And
                why not? Faith is a house with many
                rooms.

                          WRITER
                But no room for doubt?

                          ADULT PI
                Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is
                useful. It keeps faith a living
                thing. After all, you can't know
                the strength of your faith until
                it's been tested.
                                                             19.


47   INT. THE TIGER FEEDING AREA, 1973, PART 1   - DAY            47

     Pi (12) and Ravi (14) cross into a drab cement enclosure
     behind the tiger exhibit. A hallway with closed gates at both
     ends leads out to the exhibit.

                         RAVI
               Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in
               here without him.

                         PI
               Stop worrying. I have seen him do
               this a thousand times. I want to
               meet our new tiger.

     He drops meat on the floor by the bars.

                         RAVI
               Pi!...

                         PI
               Hello! Richard Parker!


48   EXT. MONTREAL STREET - DAY                                   48

     Pi and the writer walk along a Montreal street. The Writer
     stares at Pi, bewildered.

                         WRITER
               A tiger? Richard Parker was a
               tiger?

                         ADULT PI
               He got his name through a clerical
               error. A hunter caught him drinking
               from a stream when he was a cub and
               named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got
               too big, the hunter sold him to our
               zoo - but the names got switched on
               the paperwork. The hunter was
               listed as Thirsty and tiger was
               called Richard Parker. We laughed
               about it and the name stuck.


47   EXT. THE TIGER FEEDING AREA, PART TWO 1973 - DAY             47

                         RAVI
               Let's go. Before we get into
               trouble.

                         PI
               I want to see him close up.
                                                        20.


                    RAVI
          You're not a zoo keeper. Come on!

An adolescent BENGAL TIGER appears at the other end of thE
hall. Ravi bolts, running out of the feeding area. Pi is
enchanted.

                     PI
               (offering meat)
          That's it, Richard Parker. It's for
          you.

Pi holds the lamb through the bars, The tiger walks slowly
down the hallway, regarding Pi with a detached curiosity, as
unthreatening in his manner as a large housecat. Pi begins
trembling from sheer excitement.

He doesn't hear the approach of uneven footsteps - Father
appears, followed by Ravi. Just as Richard Parker approaches
the offering.

                    FATHER
          No!!!

Father yanks Pi violently away from the cage, wrenching Pi's
hand through the bars. Richard Parker, startled, raises his
head, hissing. He turns and bounds back out through the gate
at the other end of the hallway, disappearing into the
exhibit area. Father spins Pi around and shoves him against
the wall.

                    FATHER (CONT'D)
          What are you thinking?! Are you out
          of your mind? Who gave you
          permission to come back here? You
          have just ignored everything I have
          ever taught you!

                    PI
          I just wanted to say 'Hello' to
          him.

                    FATHER
          You think that tiger is your
          friend. He is an animal, not a
          playmate!

                    PI
          Animals have souls. I've seen it in
          their eyes.

Father turns to Ravi, who stands by the gate.
                                                           21.


                    FATHER
          Find Selvam!


50 EXT. THE FEEDING CAGES, 1973 - A SHORT TIME LATER 50

Father, Pi and Ravi watch as Selvam carries a goat into the
feeding area.

                     SELVAM
               (In Tamil:)
          You're sure, Mr. Patel? Pi's just a
          kid.

                    FATHER
              (In Tamil:)
          Do it. Go ahead.

Selvam sets the goat down and ties a piece of rope around the
animal's neck.


                    FATHER (CONT'D)
              (To the boys:)
          Animals don't think like we do;
          people who forget that get
          themselves killed. That tiger is
          not your friend. When you look into
          his eyes, you are seeing your own
          emotions reflected back at you -
          nothing else.

Selvam ties the goat to the bars at the gate area where Pi
had been about to feed Richard Parker.

                    RAVI
              (Quietly, to Pi:)
          Don't be stupid! Say you're sorry.

Mother arrives at the gate with a WOMAN WORKER and rushes to
Pi's side.

                    MOTHER
          What have you done, Piscine? You
          know what your father said about
          coming back here.

                    PI
          I'm sorry. I was...

Mother turns to Father, quietly - referring to the goat:

                    MOTHER
          What are you thinking?
                                                             22.


                         FATHER
               This is between a father and his
               sons.
                   (In Tamil:)
               Selvam, the gate.

                         MOTHER
               He said he's sorry. You want to
               scar them for life?

                         FATHER
               Scar them? That boy almost lost his
               arm!

                         MOTHER
               But he's still a boy!

                         FATHER
               He will be a man sooner than you
               think, and this is a lesson I do
               not want them ever to forget.
                   (Turning to Selvam:)
               Selvam.

     Selvam opens the far gate. Richard Parker re-enters the
     hallway. He sees the goat and slinks forward, lowering his
     body, his ears flattening against his skull. The goat
     freezes. Everyone watches in silence, transfixed by the
     intensity of the tiger. Pi watches the animal spirit glowing
     up within Richard Parker's eyes as instinct takes over.

     In a sudden, single burst, Richard Parker bolts the length of
     the hallway, claws reaching out through the bars of the cage
     toward the goat.

     We don't see what happens next - but the family does.

     ON THE CAGE: Only a few seconds have passed, but Richard
     Parker has already turned to go back into his enclosure, the
     lifeless goat in his mouth. The family watches - Father is
     impassive, Ravi traumatized; mother wraps her arms around Pi.


52   INT. PI AND RAVI'S BEDROOM, 1976 - MORNING                52

     A rainy early morning in monsoon season. Pi (now 16) lies in
     bed, reading "Notes from the Underground." Ravi is still
     asleep. The radio plays in the other room.

                         NEWS ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
               ... and so has placed the country
               in a State of Emergency.
                         (MORE)
                                                              23.

                         NEWS ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
               Under the directive, the states of
               Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be
               placed under the direct authority
               of the central government. Police
               will be granted powers to arrest
               and indefinitely detain citizens
               responsible for the uprising.
               Unauthorized...

     Ravi's alarm goes off. Ravi reaches to shut it off.


55   55 EXT. PI'S SCHOOL, PONDICHERRY, 1977 - DAY 55            55

     End of the school day. Pi, in raincoat, walks out to the
     street, where student bicycles are lined up by the hundreds.
     He gets his bike.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Things changed after the day of
               Appa's lesson. The world had lost
               some of its enchantment. School was
               a bore - nothing but facts,
               fractions and French. Words and
               patterns that went on and on. I
               grew restless, searching for
               something that would bring meaning
               into my life. And then I met
               Anandi...


59   I/E. DANCE STUDIO, PONDICHERRY, 1977 - DAY                 59

     CLOSE ON ANANDI (15) radiant, graceful, eyes aglow, dancing
     with passionate intensity.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Mother made me study music, and one
               day my teacher came down with the
               flu; he asked if I could take his
               place one afternoon playing rhythms
               for a dance class.

     Pi watches her, hopelessly in love, absent-mindedly drumming
     along. He is drumming for a class of a dozen female students;
     a DANCE MASTER (female) accompanies the beat vocally -
     "Tumtikita..." etc. The dance master claps her hands,
     interrupting to teach.

                         DANCE MASTER
               No. If you do not concentrate, you
               cannot express your love of God
               through dance. Feel the ground
               beneath your feet;
                         (MORE)
                                                                24.

                         DANCE MASTER (CONT'D)
               open your gaze out onto the
               horizon, let that spiritual energy
               pulse through you and out into the
               world through abinea. Anandi, come
               to the front; lead them.

     Anandi obeys; Pi watches her, lost in admiration, until the
     teacher taps a wood block to get his attention. The girls in
     the class giggle - Pi blushes, embarrassed.


60   I/E. THE TOWN MARKET/THE BANYAN TREE, 1977 - DAY             60

     Anandi walks with two of her FRIENDS through the town
     market.ACROSS THE MARKET, Pi hides behind a flower seller's
     stall. Gathering his courage, he peers out, searching for
     Anandi. She is nowhere to be seen. He walks into an open area
     of the market that surrounds a banyan tree. Suddenly, he
     hears a voice behind him.

                         ANANDI
               Why are you following me?

     Pi turns - Anandi stands before him, her friends a short
     distance behind her, eavesdropping.

                         PI
               What?

                         ANANDI
               You were following me.

                         PI
                   (After a beat, to cover
                    his evident guilt:)
               What does this mean?

     Pi vaguely imitates the hand gesture - pinching the tips of
     his fingers together - that he saw Anandi use in the dance
     rehearsal. Anandi stares at him, bewildered.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               In the dance, you went from Pataka,
               which means the forest, and then
               you did-then you did Samputa, which
               means something that is hidden, and
               after that you did this... and then
               you did Chatura.

     Pi demonstrates her dancing. Anandi smiles, while her friends
     giggle at his performance.
                                                                25.


                           PI (CONT'D)
                 But at the very end you did this...
                     (Repeating the gesture:)
                 None of the other dancers did that.
                 What did you mean? The God of love
                 is hiding in the forest?

                           ANANDI
                 No - that also means the lotus
                 flower.

                           PI
                 The lotus flower is hiding in the
                 forest? Why would a lotus flower
                 hide in the forest?

     Anandi blushes. She has no answer.


62   EXT. THE ZOO EXHIBITS, 1977 - DAY                            62

     Pi and Anandi stand at the Bengal Tiger cage, Pi proudly
     introducing Anandi to the zoo's finest exhibit.

                           PI
                 And this is Richard Parker. He's
                 the most magnificent creature we've
                 ever had here.
                     (Beat.)
                 Look at the way he's turning his
                 head. Showing off - like a dancer.

                           ANANDI
                 No, he heard something - he's
                 listening. You see?

     Pi beams.


64   INT. PATEL DINING ROOM, 1977 - DUSK                          64

     Pi sits at dinner with the family, a half-smile on his face,
     obviously lost in thoughts about Anandi. Father's voice
     gradually breaks through into Pi's consciousness.

                           FATHER
                 So...you see? We have talked about
                 it for some time... Do you
                 understand what I'm saying? Pi?

     Pi glances over.

                           PI
                 Sorry. You've been...
                                                        26.


                    FATHER
          Worried. For my family. Our animals
          are worth far more abroad than here
          in India, and if the town council
          stops supporting us, I don't know
          where we'll be. So... it is what we
          have to do. Do you understand?

                    PI
          I'm sorry... what are we talking
          about?

                    RAVI
          We are leaving India.

                    PI
          What??

                    MOTHER
          We are selling the zoo.

                    FATHER
          The zoo itself was never ours to
          sell - the land belongs to the
          town. But the animals are ours, and
          if we sell them, we will have
          enough to start a new life.

                     PI
          But where would we go? Our life is
          here Appa!

                    FATHER
          Canada. I have some opportunities
          for work in Winnipeg. I'll be
          shipping most of the animals for
          sale in North America; we can get
          freighter passage for the whole
          family. So, it is settled. We will
          sail like Columbus!

                    PI
          But Columbus was looking for India!


EXT. PONDICHERRY, BENEATH THE PIER, 1977 - DAY

Pi and Anandi sit together on the crossbeams beneath the
dock. Anandi takes a length of colored silken threads, tying
them around Pi's wrist to serve as 'Rakhi' - a sisterly
blessing for protection on his journey.
                                                             27.


                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               It takes a lot of work to sell a
               zoo; before we left Anandi and I
               had time enough to break each
               other's hearts. Of course, I
               promised I'd come back one day...
               It's funny... I remember everything
               else about our last day, but I
               don't remember saying goodbye...

     As she finishes, Pi reaches out impulsively to hold her hand.


67   EXT. CARGO SHIP DECK, 1977 - DUSK                         67

     Sunset. Pi stands at the railing of the cargo ship, staring
     out at the Chennai shoreline. Mother approaches.

                         MOTHER
               Pi, they're serving dinner below.
                   (Beat.)

     Pi doesn't respond. Mother approaches and stands beside him.

                         MOTHER (CONT'D)
                   (After a beat.)
               Piscine, You have a whole life
               ahead of you. We're doing this for
               you and Ravi. Come inside and have
               some dinner.


68   INT. THE TSIMTSUM, MESS HALL, 1977 - DAY                  68

     The family stands in the mess hall line along with the CREW.
     The FRENCH COOK, a grizzled and thoroughly unpleasant man,
     loads a plate and slides it over the counter to Mother. The
     meal consists of liver and onions, sausages, and rice soaked
     in gravy. Mother points at her rice.

                         MOTHER
               My sons and I are vegetarians. Do
               you have anything - ?

     The French Cook ladles ore gravy over her rice.

                         MOTHER (CONT'D)
               No - no! Not more gravy.

                         FRENCH COOK
                   (Thick French accent:)
               You don't want gravy?
                                                          28.


                    MOTHER
              (Quickly switching to
               French:)
          No, I want something vegetarian. I-

The cook takes her plate, sets it on the counter in front of
Father. The following takes place in French (subtitled).

                    FRENCH COOK
          There. No problems.

                    FATHER
          She asked if you have something
          vegetarian.

                    FRENCH COOK
          Vegetarian - the cow that produced
          this liver was vegetarian, the pigs
          that went into these sausages were
          vegetarian.

                    FATHER
          Very funny. But she doesn't eat
          liver.

                    FRENCH COOK
              (Getting irritated:)
          Then she can eat the sausages, the
          rice, the gravy.
              (To Mother:)
          Or you can go cook your own food.

                    FATHER
          How dare you talk to my wife like
          that?

The cook shoves a plate of plain rice over the counter.

                    FRENCH COOK
          Here's your rice. I cook for
          sailors, not curry eaters.

Father grabs the cook's forearms, yanking him halfway over
the high counter.

                    FATHER
          What did you call us??

                    FRENCH COOK
          Let go of me!

                    FATHER
          Who do you think you are? You're
          nothing but a servant!
                                                                29.


                         FRENCH COOK
               I feed people! You feed monkeys!

                         FATHER
               I'll teach you respect!

     Sailors descend on the two, pulling them apart.

                                                     A SHORT TIME
                                                          LATER -


69   INT. THE TSIMTSUM MESS HALL, 1977 - DAY                        69

     The family sits eating silently in the aftermath of the
     scuffle. A TAIWANESE SAILOR comes alongside Pi carrying a
     plate of rice with gravy. He speaks with a Taiwanese accent
     and a gentle smile.

                         TAIWANESE SAILOR
               Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I
               eat rice next to gravy. On ship,
               gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay?
               You try?

     Pi smiles in gratitude, but the gravy looks anything but
     appetizing.


70   INT. TSIMTSUM CARGO HOLD, 1977 - DAY                           70

     Pi eats a banana from the food set aside for the animals in
     the cargo hold. He sits next to the transport cage of ORANGE
     JUICE, a female orangutan with a baby orang in her arms.
     Animal crates and cages surround Pi, the air filled with
     screeches and growls.

     Father enters the hold, carrying food for the animals.

                         FATHER
                   (Noting Pi's banana:)
               Don't worry - we will have plenty
               of fresh supplies after we stop in
               Manila.

     Father mixes tranquilizer pills into food for the orangs.

                         PI
               Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's
               not going to cause any trouble.

                         FATHER
               The stress of traveling is not good
               for the animals.
                         (MORE)
                                                             30.

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
               And it helps with the seasickness.
               We don't want to be cleaning up
               after a seasick orangutan, do we?

     Pi looks up, notices Father watching him.

     Father tries to smile along with his little attempt at humor,
     but his manner is stiff, his eyes furtive and uneasy.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               My father was a businessman - he
               had never handled the animals
               himself. I realized that leaving
               India must have been harder for him
               than it was for me.


71   EXT. MONTREAL GARDENS - DAY                               71

     Adult Pi and the Writer sit on a bench in the gardens. Pi has
     fallen silent, reflective.

                           WRITER
               ... So...

                         ADULT PI
               Have I forgotten anything?

                         WRITER
               I think you've set the stage. So
               far we have an Indian boy named
               after a French swimming pool on a
               Japanese ship full of animals
               heading to Canada.

                         ADULT PI
               Yes. Now we have to send our boy
               into the middle of the Pacific, and
               -

                         WRITER
               And make me believe in God.

                         ADULT PI
               Yes. We'll get there.


72   EXT. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE PACIFIC, 1977 - DUSK      72

     Moving in on the Mariana Trench, an ominous gash of darkest
     blue...
                                                                31.


                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               It was four days out of Manila -
               above the Mariana Trench, the
               deepest spot on earth...

     Zoom closer until the blue fills the screen...

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
               Our ship, the Tsimtsum, pushed on,
               bullishly indifferent to its
               surroundings. It moved with the
               slow, massive confidence of a
               continent.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


73   EXT. THE TSIMTSUM - NIGHT                                     73

     Lightning and thunder. The freighter sailing in ominous
     weather, the name Tsimtsum emblazoned on its hull. Choppy
     seas, rains, a storm.


74   INT. CARGO SHIP, THE FAMILY CABIN - NIGHT                     74

     Darkness - the faint glow of a nightlight. Close on Pi's
     sleeping face, the cabin swaying in the storm.

     BANG. A loud, deep rumble breaks into his consciousness. The
     ship shakes. Pi's eyes open. He looks around, listens.
     Nothing. He leans over the side of his bunk and wakes Ravi.

                         PI
               Ravi? Did you hear that?
                   (Pause)
               Ravi?

                         RAVI
               ... I'm sleeping.

                         PI
               It's a thunderstorm! Let's go
               watch!

                          RAVI
               Are you crazy? We'll get hit by
               lightning.

                         PI
               No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge
               first.
                                                               32.


                         RAVI
               Don't tempt a storm, Pi.

     On the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts
     uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father.


75   INT. SHIP HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               75

     Pi heads upstairs to the deck.


76   EXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS                             76

     The deck of the ship is dark. Pi steps out into a bracing
     rain and walks to the rail, wind whipping his hair. He
     laughs, exhilarated, as rain splashes over his face. Throwing
     arms wide, Pi dances in imitation of Anandi's dance, slipping
     more than once on the rain-soaked deck, shouting in giddy
     adolescent triumph.

                         PI
               More rain, lord of storms! Let it
               rage!

     He finishes, laughing as he falls against the railing. The
     deck lights suddenly all come on at once; a warning alarm
     sounds over the loudspeakers.

     Pi slips to the front of the deck and stands up, watching in
     horror as a wave washes over the bow, carrying several
     sailors overboard. He pushes himself away from the railing
     and runs back down below.


     INT. THE STAIRS TO THE CABINS/LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

     Pi stumbles down the tilted staircase.

                         PI
               AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT!

     Halfway down, Pi hits water. He dives, searching for his
     family. The hall lights flicker - the passage falls dark an
     instant before the emergency lights come on in the water
     below, which nearly reaches the ceiling. Pi dives, trying to
     swim against the flowing current; he's astonished to find a
     ZEBRA swimming toward him, passing overhead. He tries to swim
     further, but the enormous force of rushing water and air is
     too great; he scrambles backward, groping toward the
     stairwell.
                                                        33.


EXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS

Pi bursts on deck, coughing and gagging for air.

                    PI
          HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

Pi sees movement - animals running. He scrambles toward them,
the ship groaning as it lists sideways.

Oxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck,
backlit by emergency lights; Pi hears monkeys screeching, the
clatter of hoofs pounding. In the distance, Sailors shout
orders in panicked voices.

Pi comes onto the lower deck, where he sees three men - the
Buddhist (Taiwanese Sailor) from the dining hall; the
JAPANESE CAPTAIN, and SAILOR #1 - arguing with the French
cook, who has climbed into the stern of one of the lifeboats
that hangs off the side of the ship. Pi runs to the Captain.

                    PI (CONT'D)
          Please save my family!

                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN
          Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here.

He grabs a life vest and starts to put it on Pi.

                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
          Here, put this on!

                    PI
          You have to help them, please! Oh
          no my family, please. You have to
          help them, my family is back there.

                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN
          We don't have time.

The Taiwanese Sailor jumps onto the ship.

                    TAIWANESE SAILOR
          We help. You must go.

                    PI
          Who let all the animals out?

They shove a life vest over Pi's head.

                    SAILOR #1
          You have to go now.
                                                        34.


                    PI
          No wait! My father - he can't swim -

                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN
          This is your last chance--just go!

                       PI
          No please!

They guide Pi to the side, where a section of the ship's
railing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat. They
push Pi over the edge; Pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing
on the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across
the bow. He grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to
slip off. The sailors are shouting at the French cook, who
stands at the stern.

                    SAILOR #1
          Hey! You! What are you doing?!

                    FRENCH COOK
          Loosen the lines! Bring it down!

                    SAILOR #1
          Tie it down! Tie it down!

                    FRENCH COOK
              (to the sailors:)
          Jump! Jump!

The sailors look towards the upper deck. Pi follows their
looks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over
the side of the ship, careening through the air toward the
safety of the lifeboat. The French cook staggers backward and
jumps out of the way, falling to the water below. Pi throws
up his arms as the life boat starts to drop. The zebra arcs
through the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed
stern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. The
force sends the rig lines spinning.

The lifeboat plummets to the water below. The impact spins it
around, nearly washing Pi overboard. He is left clinging to
the back of the tarp, the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat
before him. As the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell,
Pi slides to the front of the tarp. The Tsimtsum's propeller
rises behind him.

As Pi steadies himself, a swell lifts the lifeboat, crashing
it onto the deck of the Tsimtsum. It drops back into the sea,
rolling over completely. The vessel instantly rights itself -
the lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable. Pi lands
on the lifeboat's floorboards, next to the zebra.
                                                             35.


     Pi sees the Tsimtsum at an angle, it's bow dipping below the
     water. As he tries to get up, Pi notices the orange emergency
     whistle that dangles from the vest. He grabs it and blows,
     shouting between blasts.

                         PI
               HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY, HELP ME!

     The deck lights of the freighter glow with a cheery,
     unnatural brilliance. By the light of the ship, Pi can just
     make out a distant figure in the water.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               HEY! OVER HERE!

     Pi spies a lifebuoy tied to a rope. He grabs it and heaves it
     as far as he can across the water. OUT IN THE WATER, the
     lifebuoy splashes a few yards away from the shadowy figure.

     The moment Pi feels the tug on the line, he jumps into the
     uncovered part of the boat, lies back and begins hauling the
     rope in. Nearly finished, he lifts his head to peer over the
     side and sees who he's rescued.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               Richard Parker?

     A beat - and then Pi realizes what he's done. He scrambles
     backward in horror, trying to throw the rope overboard.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               NO! GO AWAY!

     Richard Parker paddles toward the boat. Pi grabs an oar,
     wielding it against the approaching tiger. Richard Parker
     tries to grab the oar. Pi yanks the oar away, falling onto
     his back.

     He listens as Richard Parker claws his way up the side of the
     swaying boat, coughing and gagging water. Pi scrambles
     backward, oar still in hand. He rises and jumps overboard.


79   EXT. THE OCEAN - CONTINUOUS                                  79

     Pi plunges into the roiling water. An enormous wave rolls
     toward Pi - filling his lungs with air, Pi dives under, away
     from the assault of the raging storm.


80   EXT. BENEATH THE WATER - CONTINUOUS                          80

     Silence as Pi hangs below the surface, arms wide, groping for
     focus and calm.
                                                              36.


     Lightning casts a blazing white veil over the surface of the
     water above him, backlighting fish and animals, waves frozen
     in time like wrinkled bedsheets, their motionless texture
     pocked and dimpled with raindrops. As the sky explodes in
     white flashes, the scene is caught in surreal still shots.

     A hippo swims past, it's heavy form moving gracefully.

     Pi swims toward the camera - then freezes, reacting in horror
     as...

     A shark swoops past him and up toward the struggling animals
     near the surface. Pi dives defensively - the camera follows.
     Ahead, the Tsimtsum is visible, fifty feet beyond Pi, its
     deck lights dipping below the surface, casting an eerie
     underwater glow, bubbles flowing up to the surface; nearby,
     Pi can make out the floating oar.


81   EXT. THE OCEAN/THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS                       81

     Pi bursts above water in total panic, throwing his arms
     around the oar, coughing up sea water and bile. The lifebuoy
     floats a dozen feet off; he swims toward it. He grabs the oar
     moments before a huge wave sweeps him up and over the
     lifeboat. He lands on the other side, the oar lost, and drags
     himself onto the stern. He jumps over the kicking zebra and
     scrambles onto the boat tarp.

     An oar sticks out from under the boat cover, hanging out over
     the front of the lifeboat. Pi climbs out on the oar, keeping
     himself a safe distance from the tiger he assumes is beneath
     the tarp. The air vibrates with a tremendous belching groan;
     Pi looks over to the cargo ship, watching, astounded...

                         PI
               Amma! Appa! Ravi! I'm sorry! I'm
               sorry...!

     WIDE SHOT - from top, looking down into the water: the
     Tsimtsum abruptly keels and sinks beneath the surface. Pi
     watches in horror as the Tsimtsum plummets into the depths of
     the Mariana Trench, it's deck lights gradually fading. Pi
     bursts into tears as waves from the sinking vessel buffet his
     lifeboat.

     Pi weeps uncontrollably.


     EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAWN

     The storm has passed, but the skies are still heavy with
     disgusting grey clouds. Pi has hung the lifebuoy on the oar
     and now sits on it, slumped in exhaustion and shivering.
                                                        37.


With what energy he still has, he weeps - his face is puffy
and swollen from a night of tears.

Pi watches a shark fin knife through the waves. His feet have
been trailing in the water; he quickly lifts them out. He
raises his head, looking at his new surroundings - water and
air, clouds and sky. Nothing on the horizon.

Pi creeps forward on the oar, pulling himself onto the
gunnels - the side of the boat. No sign of Richard Parker.

The zebra comes into view in the stern of the lifeboat,
injured legs folded beneath it, staring indifferently into
space.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY

Pi stands a few feet away from the zebra, using an emergency
bucket to bail water out of the bottom of the boat, exhausted
from the effort. He pauses to catch his breath, then becomes
aware of a slight movement at one side of the tarp.

A SPOTTED HYENA lurches furtively into view from beneath the
tarp, then disappears again. Pi freezes, dumbfounded.

                    PI
          Hari?

Hari, the hyena, with a sloping, bear-like forehead and the
nervous manner of a beaten dog, reappears. Pi instantly dives
across the tarp, scrambling for safety on the oar. The hyena
staggers and stumbles listlessly. Pi turns to face the
creature, struggling for calm.

                    PI (CONT'D)
          Looks as though your drugs haven't
          worn off yet.

The screech of a terrified animal echoes across the water -
the hyena looks out to port, the hair rising on its back,
then staggers beneath the tarp.

Pi squints into the rising sun. An enormous bundle of bananas
bobs into view. The bundle twists and rolls - and Orange
Juice, the orangutan tries desperately to stay on top.

                    PI (CONT'D)
          Orange Juice!! This way!
                                                             38.


     Within moments, the bundle is within reach of the lifeboat;
     Pi catches the oar handle in the netting that binds the
     bananas together and pulls it against the side of the boat.
     O.J. falls onboard in a stuporous fog.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               Welcome to Pi's ark!

     The netting, wrapped around the handle of the oar, pulls
     loose from the bananas, which tumble out of reach. As Pi
     reels the netting in, O.J. moans in distress. Pi throws a
     banana to O.J. but she is too sick to react.

                         PI (CONT'D)
                   (A sudden realization)
               Where is your boy, Orange Juice?
                   (Pause)
               I'll bet Mother and Father found
               him. They'll all be here soon.

     O.J. turns to look at Pi, a look of inconsolable sadness in
     her eyes - as though she knows better what lies ahead.


84   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     84

     High noon. Intolerable heat. Flies circle the zebra, landing
     on Pi's face and arms. He's too exhausted to brush them away.
     The only sound is the incessant lapping of water against the
     hull. Pi stares out across the ocean - no rescue in sight. He
     pushes himself upright, calling over the waves.

                           PI
               HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?

     Pi kneels and bangs his bailing bucket against the hull. The
     hyena emergees, shaking its head violently in an attempt to
     clear its thoughts. It screams in frustration and begins
     yipping. Pi picks up the oar and pokes the hyena to fend it
     off. He watches with increasing alarm as the hyena paces in
     frantic circles - whatever tranquilizers this animal received
     are wearing off. The boy wraps his grip around the paddle,
     prepared to defend himself.

     The hyena abruptly stops pacing, coughing and retching - then
     lies down, shaking from emotional and physical distress. It
     sets its head on the edge of the tarp, predator eyes fastened
     on Pi.


85   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DUSK                                    85

     A boy, a hyena, a zebra and an orangutan silhouetted against
     the last fading light of day.
                                                             39.


     Pi has hung the paddle and lifebuoy off the end of the boat
     and perches on the bow. The hyena's eyes seem to glow in the
     last light, fixed on Pi. Pi stares back.

     Pi fights fatigue as waves splash interminably against the
     hull. He winces at each creak of the lifeboat; his eyes glaze
     over as he stares out at the endless, dusky seascape. Pi sees
     movement in the shadows. The hyena attacks the zebra; the
     zebra barks and squeals. O.J. reacts to the violence, crying
     out.

                         PI
               No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it!
               Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!


86   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAWN                                     86

     Silence. Morning. Hazy. Pi slumps over the oar, eyes half
     open, glazed. He has stayed up a second night for fear of
     being attacked, and now he slowly nods sideways, giving in to
     exhaustion despite himself, and tumbles into the water.

     Pi gasps in shock as the water slaps him into full
     consciousness. He climbs back onto the life ring - coughing,
     tired, wet, sad and fearful.

     The lifeboat rolls and growls beneath Pi's feet as he stares -
     and then he notices O.J. The poor orang is sitting on a side
     bench half-hidden by the tarp, and horribly seasick. Her
     tongue lolls out of her mouth and she's visibly panting.

                         PI
               I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any
               seasickness medicine for you -

     And then it strikes him.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               Supplies! Ah, supplies!

     Pi pulls up the edge of the tarp nearest the bow. A row of
     benches with hinged lids curve around the bow. Pi opens the
     rearmost bench and finds a "LIFEBOAT MANUAL AND NAVIGATIONAL
     GUIDE" in a plastic bag along with a pencil lying on top of
     bags of supplies. He pulls out the manual and flips through
     it - an illustration shows that the boat is lined with
     compartments. He opens the next bench - it's stuffed with
     life jackets.

     He tosses one of the life jackets to O.J., who has no idea
     what to make of it. O.J. turns to watch him, utterly
     bewildered.
                                                              40.


88   EXT. THE OCEAN, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT/THE LIFEBOAT - DAY       88

     An hour later. Pi finishes tying a knot in a piece of rope
     that joins oars to the lifebuoy. Pull back to reveal that Pi
     has built a makeshift raft, tying three oars into a triangle
     around the lifebuoy and using the banana net to gather the
     life vests into a bunch beneath.

     Pi sits back, mopping his brow, then begins pushing and
     dragging his raft over to the edge of the lifeboat to launch
     it.

     The hyena comes out from under the tarp to see what all the
     noise is. As it paces, it gets too close to O.J., who
     suddenly comes to life, rising up to her full height, pulling
     back her lips and roaring. The hair on the hyena's neck and
     shoulders stands up - suddenly, it launches an attack. Pi
     cries out, flinching - but O.J. uses one of her long arms to
     thump the beast on top of the head.

     Pi cheers the blow -

                            PI
               YES!

     But the hyena gets up in an instant - it attacks again, this
     time going for O.J.'s throat.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               NO!! NO!! NO!! NO!!

     O.J. gets pulled down to the floor of the boat, the battle
     continuing out of view. Pi searches through the piles of
     rope, finding a knife. He rises and dashes forward.

     Pi reaches the end of the tarp. The hyena retreats. O.J. lies
     in the stern, dead.

     Pi, enraged, confronts the hyena.

                         PI (CONT'D)
               Come on! Come on!! COME ON...!!!

     Pi feels the tarp move under his feet... suddenly, Richard
     Parker launches like a blur from under the canvas, going
     straight after the hyena. Pi falls backward on the tarp,
     stunned.

     As the tiger clamps his jaws around the hyena, finishing it
     off, Pi leaps back to the bow, shoving his makeshift raft
     into the water. The raft splashes in the water and the tiger
     turns; Pi looks back and comes face-to-face with Richard
     Parker.
                                                                41.


      The tiger stands with front feet on the crossbench, sniffing
      the sea air, examining his surroundings for the first time,
      agitated by this open air environment. As he turns to go back
      under the tarp, his gaze falls on Pi. Richard Parker's ears
      swivel, and his lip twitches, revealing a canine as long as a
      finger.

      Pi, terrified, grabs an oar and holds it out, trying to
      prevent an attack. Unfortunately, he also blocks Richard
      Parker's path back under the tarp. The tiger tries to go
      around the oar, and when Pi blocks his way, the tiger swings
      a paw, knocking the oar into the ocean with such force that
      Pi is spun completely around with his back to the tiger. He
      falls into a crouch, cowering, prepared to die.

      Richard Parker's predator instinct takes over. He snarls and
      pounces on the tarp, menacingly close to Pi - then hesitates,
      unsettled by the softness of the tarp beneath his feet. The
      tiger retreats, examining his surroundings.

      Pi jumps toward the raft. He belly flops into the ocean and
      rises in a panic, trying to scramble up onto the raft, only
      to have it flip completely over his head.


A88   EXT THE RAFT - DAY                                         A88

      Grey, lifeless skies above the vastness of the ocean. Pi
      shivers, his eyes glassy, his lips chapped and skin waxen
      from hours of exposure. He tries various ways to re-shape the
      raft.

      A shark slips up alongside Pi and bumps him, sending Pi
      scrambling back to the safety of the raft.


91    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     91

      Pi pulls the raft to the back of the lifeboat, tying the rope
      line on one of the tarp hooks. Hands appear on the gunnels.
      Pi lifts his head over the bow. The tiger is nowhere in
      sight. Pi quietly climbs aboard. He tries in vain to control
      his chattering teeth and shaking limbs as he opens the
      starboard bow storage bench.

      He sees a duffel bag, zips it open and rifles through the
      contents. It contains an array of survival supplies - as he
      lifts it out, his eye falls upon a stack of cans marked
      "Water." He pops a hole in a water can with the can opener
      and drinks one, tilting his head back and closing his eyes in
      ecstasy. He throws a few on the raft. He grabs a couple of
      boxes marked "Baked Wheat Biscuits." Pi tears open a box and
      stuffs a biscuit into his mouth.
                                                           42.


The biscuits are so dry that he is barely able to chew them -
crumbs fall from his lips into the supply hatch.

A rat skitters out from under the tarp, grabbing biscuit
crumbs, then retreating.

A low growl. Richard Parker charges out from his den and
bounds onto the tarp. Pi staggers in terror and falls
helplessly into the storage bench, with only his head poking
out above the tarp.

The tiger steps toward Pi, then hesitates - again, the
softness of the tarp unnerves him. He steps back off the tarp
and paces the stern.

Pi creeps out of the storage bench - then watches in horror
as Richard Parker swivels and charges him again, this time
beneath the tarp. The rat scurries back out of hiding and
Richard Parker's head follows, looming up out from the gap
between the tarp and the storage bench. Pi jumps onto the
tarp, out of the tiger's reach.

Richard Parker scrambles backward and reappears at the far
end of the tarp, roaring, prepared to attack from above -
then halts, watching in astonishment as the rat hops around
the lifeboat, finally running up Pi's shirt and landing on
Pi's head.

Pi grabs the rat by the tail and throws it. The rat sails,
paws and tail stretched wide, across the boat. Richard Parker
opens his mouth and the rat flies in, its tail disappearing
between the tiger's lips like a spaghetti noodle.

As Richard Parker enjoys his treat, Pi climbs backward over
the bow, unhooking the rope, grabbing the water cans and the
biscuits and slipping over the side, falling into the water.

He drops onto the raft and pushes himself back with his feet.
The raft floats back and hits the end of the ropeline with a
jerk. Pi remembers the rope and goes back to untie it.

Suddenly Richard Parker appears at the bow and lunges at him,
almost falling off the front of the lifeboat onto Pi. The
tiger scrambles back onto the boat and off the tarp, while Pi
paddles the raft away.

When he is finally at a safe distance, fear and stress
overwhelm Pi - he throws up what little food and water he has
taken.
                                                             43.


92   EXT. THE RAFT, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                  92

     A full moon, backlit clouds rolling through the skies,
     reflected in the water below. Pi floats behind the lifeboat,
     weeping, surrounded by nothing but terror and the abyss. A
     thick range of clouds moves in, threatening to cut off the
     light from the moon and stars.

     Pi watches Richard Parker on the lifeboat, a shadowy
     silhouette on the bow ahead. The tiger takes the zebra
     carcass under the tarp. The clouds blot out the sky. Darkness
     envelops them.


93   EXT. ABOVE THE RAFT - EARLY MORNING                         93

     Angle on Pi, the raft and boat from above, lost on an endless
     ocean, the bright colors of morning light dancing on the
     surface of the water.

     Pi has taken out his pencil and now writes on the back page
     of his survival manual, his voice heard over:

                         PI (WRITING V.O.)
               "My name is Pi Patel. I have been
               in a shipwreck. I am on a lifeboat
               alone - with a tiger. Please send
               help."

     He tears the page out and stuffs it into an empty water can,
     sealing the opening with a plastic lid. He tosses it as far
     as possible; the can splashes down, rippling the water, then
     bobs, going nowhere. Pi stares at the bobbing can, crushed as
     he sees the futility of this plan.

     A defeated pause, and then Pi looks up and sees the majesty
     of his surroundings. The cloud cover breaks; dawn light glows
     down on Pi.

     A grunt from the lifeboat. Pi turns, surprised. He grabs the
     tow line and reels into the lifeboat.

     He lifts the tarp; Richard Parker's eyes glow out at him from
     the shadows, greeting Pi with a low snarl. Pi gingerly lowers
     the tarp and casts the raft back from the bow. He looks up.

                         PI (CONT'D)
                   (In awe, shuddering:)
               God... I give myself to you. I am
               your vessel. Whatever comes... I
               want to know. Show me.

                                                      FADE TO:
                                                              44.


      EXT. THE RAFT - DAY

      Pi sits on his makeshift raft, flipping through his manual.
      The foldout map of the manual shows the ocean's currents,
      longitudes, latitudes, and depths. Pi stares at the chart,
      bewildered by it all. He rises up on his knees, looking out
      at the ocean around him, then sits back, hand to forehead.

                          PI
                There are no lines!


      95 EXT. THE RAFT - DAY - MONTAGE 95

      Montage - Pi struggling with discomfort on his raft.

                          PI (READING - V.O.)
                "Set your house in order and dig in
                for the battle to survive.
                Establish a strict schedule for
                eating, keeping watch and getting
                rest. Do not drink urine or sea
                water.


                Keep busy, but avoid unnecessary
                exertion. The mind can be kept
                occupied by playing card games,
                Twenty Questions, or I Spy.
                Community singing is another sure-
                fire way to lift the spirits.
                Telling stories is highly
                recommended. Above all, don't lose
                hope."

      - Pi scratches marks into the side of the boat to indicate
      the passage of time - it is his 11th day at sea.


A96   EXT. THE RAFT - A SHORT TIME LATER                       A96

      Pi is still reading his survival manual. The waves pick up.
      The lifeboat rocks. Somewhere beneath the tarp, the tiger
      lets out a faint groan of discomfort. On Pi as he
      contemplates this...

                          PI (READING V.O.:)
                "Few things can sap the spirit
                faster than seasickness. Waves are
                more strongly felt when a boat
                turns sideways to the current. A
                sea anchor is used as a drag to
                keep the boat's head to the wind.
                          (MORE)
                                                             45.

                         PI (READING V.O.:) (CONT'D)
               Proper use of them can increase
               control and reduce seasickness
               during rough seas...

     Pi takes a sea anchor from inside his life ring and tosses it
     overboard. As soon as the sea anchor has been deployed, the
     raft slows down and the anchor lines go taut.


97   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                           97

     Pi has rigged an additional line between the open end of the
     lifeboat and his raft.

                         PI (READING V.O.)
               For castaways who must share their
               lifeboats with large dangerous
               carnivores it's advisable to
               establish a territory as your own.
               The following course of action is
               recommended.
               Step one: choose a day when waves
               are moderate but regular.
               Step two: with the lifeboat facing
               into the waves, making the ride as
               comfortable as possible, blow your
               whistle soothingly.
               Step three: turn the lifeboat
               sideways to the waves, accompanied
               by harsh aggressive use of the
               whistle. With sufficient
               repetition, the animal will
               associate the sound of the whistle
               with the discomfort of seasickness.
               Similar methods have long been used
               by circus trainers, though they
               generally lack access to rough
               seas.

     He reels in this line, turning the boat sideways to the
     waves. The rocking increases. Pi blows the whistle several
     times harshly ("warning" signal) as the rocking increases.
     From within the boat, he hears the tiger groan. He grabs the
     original lifeline that connects the raft to the boat and
     hauls himself in. Pi grins, spits out the whistle.

                         PI (CONT'D)
                   (A ringmaster's call:)

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Are you ready for the miracle of
                it? Well, then - I give to you...

      Pi lets go of the second line, raising his hand with a
      flourish.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                ... the ASTOUNDING BENGAL TIGER!

      He pulls the raft next to the tarp end of the lifeboat. The
      tiger crawls out from under the tarp, violently ill.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                    (Rocking the boat:)
                Hello, Richard Parker. Sorry about
                the choppy ride.

      Pi pulls himself onto the bow. Richard Parker tries to lift
      his head, then groans, giving it up. Pi lifts the whistle to
      his mouth and blows it repeatedly as he advances to the front
      edge of the tarp, opens his fly and pisses in a straight line
      across the midpoint of the boat.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                    (Pointing:)
                MINE! YOU UNDERSTAND? YOURS - MINE!
                    (He blows his whistle)
                You understand?

      He steps back to observe the effect of this provocation on
      the seasick tiger. Richard Parker staggers to the edge of the
      tarp. He takes a deep sniff and winces, groaning, his tongue
      hanging out in distaste. The tiger turns away from Pi, facing
      the stern. Pi thinks the battle is won - until the tiger
      lifts his tail and sprays him with a tremendous burst of
      urine.

                          PI (READING V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Step four: disregard steps one
                through three.


A97   EXT. THE RAFT - AFTERNOON                                 A97

      Pi pulls in the solar still. Pi bends down to suck fresh
      water from the straw that protrudes from a water still,
      delighted to discover that it works. He carefully pours some
      of the water into a can for himself, then pours the rest into
      a bucket.
                                                                47.


B97   EXT. THE RAFT/THE LIFEBOAT - A SHORT TIME LATER            B97

      Pi pulls himself up to the bow of the lifeboat, sets a bucket
      of water in the boat and blows his whistle. Richard Parker
      sticks his head out from under the tarp.

                          PI
                Here, Richard Parker. I've got some
                water for you.

      Pi blows the whistle once more, casting the raft adrift
      again. Richard Parker sniffs, then begins lapping greedily at
      the water.


103   EXT. RAFT - INSERT                                         103

      INSERT of Pi writing in manual - text on page reflects Pi's
      accompanying V.O.

                          PI (VO)
                In the zoo, we fed our tigers an
                average of five kilos of meat a
                day. Richard Parker will be getting
                hungry soon.


104   EXT. RAFT - CONTINUOUS                                     104

      Pi chews for a moment, then spits out a blob of biscuit and
      presses the food ball onto his hook, savoring the crumbs that
      remain in his mouth. He tosses the hook and biscuit onto the
      water - the hook sinks, leaving the crumble of biscuit
      floating uselessly on the surface. Pi watches helplessly as
      fish rise to the surface to nibble at the soggy crumbs.

                          PI (V.O.)
                Tigers are powerful swimmers, and,
                if he gets hungry enough, I'm
                afraid the little bit of water
                between us won't be any protection.
                I need to find a way to feed him.
                God made tigers carnivores, so I
                must learn to catch fish. If I
                don't, I'm afraid his last meal
                will be a skinny vegetarian boy.

      Pi thinks a moment. He takes off one of his shoes, using the
      knife to cut a sliver of leather off the side. He presses the
      hook through the leather and tosses it in the water. Pi pulls
      in his fishing line - the leather is gone.

                                                      A SHORT TIME
                                                           LATER -
                                                              48.


105   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                          105

      Pi has cut his shoe into a dozen bits of leather and tried
      fishing several times - Always with the same result. Richard
      Parker, watching, mops at his jaw to wipe away drool - he's
      clearly getting hungry.

                            PI
                Patience!


      EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DUSK

      Pi still fishes with no success. Richard Parker stares in the
      water at the dorado. He leans over the side of the boat,
      pawing hungrily at the surface as fish streak past - but the
      fish elude him. Richard Parker leans out further, striking
      with both paws - and finally jumps in altogether.

      Richard Parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past. Pi
      grins at the tiger's predicament - but the moment Richard
      Parker realizes he can't climb back aboard, he begins
      swimming toward the raft. Pi snaps to, recognizing the danger
      he's in. He reels the raft over to the lifeboat, practically
      leaping onto the bow.

      As he hauls the raft aboard, Richard Parker manages to catch
      the netting on the raft with one paw. Pi leans back against
      an oar with all his weight, trying to lever the raft aboard;
      the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the
      water. Pi is about to lose the struggle when the tiger's claw
      rips through the netting, and the lifeboat springs back up in
      the water; the momentum flips the raft up onto the boat.

      Pi turns, watching as Richard Parker swims up behind him
      alongside the bow. He digs into the supply box and rises with
      a hatchet in his hand, crossing to stand over the tiger and
      blowing the whistle threateningly.

      Standoff. Pi pumps the axe a few times, but cannot bring
      himself to kill the tiger. Richard Parker stares up at Pi a
      long moment, then paddles to the stern, trying once again to
      pull himself aboard at the other end of the boat.

                          PI
                What am I doing?

      Pi kicks at the side of the boat in frustration, and is
      surprised to hear a metal clunk. He finds a rectangular
      aluminum air box used for bouyancy: Pi then pulls the tarp
      back fully for the first time and examines the contents
      below.
                                                                  49.


       As he removes one of the floorboard panels, imagining new
       uses for the wooden slats, he hears Richard Parker scratching
       at the hull of the boat.

                           PI (CONT'D)
                 Wait - I'm thinking.


107    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                   107

       Pi has tied a bunch of the flotation boxes to his raft and
       loaded it with all the provisions from the lifeboat. He
       points a flashlight beam over the side at the exhausted
       Richard Parker, the tiger's face and whiskers just above the
       surface of the water, scratching at the side of the boat.

       Pi backs to the other end of the boat, pushing his raft into
       the water with one hand as he rocks the boat to help Richard
       Parker climb in. The moment the tiger is aboard, Pi climbs
       onto the raft and pushes off, retreating to safety, blowing
       the whistle to remind Richard Parker who's in command.

       As he floats away, Pi collapses, exhausted, on the raft.


A107   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                        A107

       Pi goes through the supplies listed in his survival guide,
       matching supplies to the pile of booty he's just retrieved
       from the lifeboat.

                           PI (WRITING - V.O.)
                 93 cans of water...


B107   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                        B107

       Pi removes all of the lifejackets from under the life ring,
       stacking them onto his latest raft structure. The empty
       banana netting now drapes beneath the raft; Pi notices that
       dorado are attracted to the net and gets an idea.

       One of the dorados gets very close to the net - Pi realizes
       his opportunity. He hauls in the netting and wrestles the
       dorado onto the raft, flailing against the creature's
       strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to
       keep it from sliding back into the ocean, riding it like a
       bucking bronco. Pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes
       the fish over and over again. As the fish begins to die, it
       flashes all kinds of colors in rapid succession - blue,
       green, red, gold and violet flicker and shimmer neon-like on
       its surface. Pi starts back, watching this colorful display
       in terrified wonder. Finally, the fish ebbs to grey,
       lifeless.
                                                               50.


                              PI
                 I'm sorry.     I'm sorry.

       Pi is devastated. He weeps, bringing his hands together,
       pressing them against his forehead, murmuring a prayer to
       himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief.

                           PI (CONT'D)
                 Thank you, Lord Vishnu. Thank you
                 for coming in the form of a fish
                 and saving our lives. Thank you...


108    EXT. THE RAFT/THE LIFEBOAT - A SHORT TIME LATER             108

       Pi reels himself over to the lifeboat. He moves around to the
       side of the boat, grabs the dorado by the tail and throws the
       entire fish over the side and into the stern. It lands with a
       thud, and from somewhere inside the boat, Richard Parker lets
       out a grunt of surprise.

       After a moment, Pi hears the wet mashing noises of the tiger
       devouring the fish. As Pi pushes away from the lifeboat, he
       puts the whistle in his mouth, blowing a few sharp blasts to
       remind Richard Parker who's in charge.


112A   EXT. THE RAFT - NIGHT                                   112A

       A full moon. All around the raft, the green surface of the
       water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton - and
       beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in
       multiple directions. Pi brushes his fingers over the surface
       of the water. The surface ripples where he touched it, the
       plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and
       downward through the water, an ever-expanding ring.

       Pi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. He peers into
       the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. Richard Parker
       is nowhere to be seen. The blows stop and Pi returns his
       attention to the light show below.

       Pi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing
       energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface.

       Suddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped
       in phosphorescent plankton - a HUMPBACK WHALE - streaks to
       the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. Fifty feet in length,
       it thrusts itself up into the air. Pi barely has time to
       react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the
       whale comes crashing back down into the water.
                                                              51.


      The animal slips back into the ocean, creating a wave that
      sends the raft swirling across the water's surface,
      submerging for a moment, then bouncing off the side of the
      lifeboat.

      Pi's neatly-stacked water cans and biscuits tumble over the
      side of the raft and into the ocean.

      The whale disappears into the night, leaving Pi open-mouthed
      and shaken.

                          PI (V.O.)
                Of course, I brought all the
                biscuits and water on the raft with
                me to keep them safe. Idiot.


116   EXT. THE RAFT/LIFEBOAT - LATE AFTERNOON                  116

      A calm day; gentle waves. Afternoon, the sun beating down. Pi
      wears his shirt wrapped around his head to hold off the heat.

                          PI (V.O. - CONT'D)
                Hunger can change everything you
                ever thought you knew about
                yourself.

      Pi uses his knife to cut another scratch into the hull. There
      are 38 scratches on the side of the lifeboat. He glances
      down, staring longingly at the fish that swim just beneath
      the raft, then looks across the lifeboat, where the gaff lies
      hooked in the tarp close to the tiger's end of the boat.
      Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen.

      Pi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff,
      but it is hooked deeply into the tarp. He lays the boat hook
      on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the
      gaff. As he wiggles the hook free, Richard Parker's head pops
      out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away.

      Pi's winces, prepared for an attack. In an instant, he's
      struck hard across the face - a stunning blow that sends him
      backward onto the tarp.

      Pause. Pi opens one eye. Richard Parker hasn't moved. Pi
      looks down - a slender grey-blue fish with wings is flopping
      about on the tarp. Pi has been hit by a flying fish.

      Richard Parker has seen the flying fish as well. He rises to
      his haunches. Pi grabs the flying fish and tosses it to
      Richard Parker.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Here, it's yours.
                                                          52.


The tiger stands, jaws opening in anticipation...

And then the fish extends its wings, veering at the last
second and dropping into the water. Richard Parker tries to
bat the fish down, but it's too quick for him. The tiger
turns back toward Pi with a questioning glare.

The air around the boat whirs   to life as they are struck from
all directions by a school of   flying fish that descends upon
them like a swarm of locusts.   Some sail clear over the boat;
a number crash into the side.   Other, less fortunate fish land
in the boat, where they start   a racket of flapping and
flailing. Pi yelps in anguish   as he is struck repeatedly.

The school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by
tuna. It is a feeding frenzy - the ocean boils with jumping
fish and snapping jaws.

Richard Parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill, leaping,
blocking, and batting down as many of the fish as he can.

A fat, three-foot long yellowfin tuna lands onboard, cracking
hard against the center bench and falling, stunned and
twitching, into the boat.

Pi sees Richard Parker's head swivel in his direction. In a
moment of insanity brought on by hunger, Pi reaches back and
grabs the boat hook from the tarp, shoving it aggressively
into the tiger's face just as Richard Parker launches
forward.

The boat hook catches Richard Parker square in the mouth; the
tiger staggers back in shock and growls in outrage. Pi rises
up to his full height, staring directly into the tiger's eyes
and shouting in fury, his gaze wide, his posture defiant.

                    PI (CONT'D)
          MINE!!!! MINE!!! AHHH!!
          AAAAHHHH!!!!

Boy and tiger face off for several seconds, both panting,
neither blinking nor showing fear, as the rain of fish
gradually slows around them.

Richard Parker turns his focus from Pi and takes in the
situation around him. Realizing that he stands up to his
knees in a pile of flying fish, he turns his attention to a
more convenient meal.

Pi uses the gaff to snag the tuna, shoving it to the farthest
edge of the bow. As he rises, late afternoon light casts
golden flames across the surface of the water, throwing Pi
into backlight.
                                                               53.


       Pi picks up the boat hook and turns to face Richard Parker.


       EXT. THE RAFT - SUNSET

       Pi takes a small piece of tuna and gingerly raises it to his
       lips, tasting flesh for the first time. A pause as he savors
       the taste, considering... and then hunger takes him over. He
       grabs at the tuna, stuffing pieces into his mouth, devouring
       it.


A132   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                 A132

       Pi uses a bandage from the first aid kit to wrap a cut on his
       leg. As he works, he glances back toward the boat, deep in
       contemplation.

                           PI (V.O.)
                 I can't risk my life every time I
                 have to climb onto the boat for
                 supplies. It's time to settle this.
                 If we're going to live together, we
                 have to learn to communicate.


B132   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                     B132

       Pi reaches into the stern, prying loose a seven-foot strip of
       wooden molding that lines the front edge of the seats.

                           PI (V.O.)
                 Maybe Richard Parker cannot be
                 tamed, but with God's will, he can
                 be trained.

       Pi works intently with his knife, whittling the strip of
       molding into a long tapered wand with a handgrip on one end.


133    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                  133

       Pi crosses the tarp, approaching Richard Parker with his new
       training stick.

       The tiger backs off as Pi approaches - curious and annoyed.
       Pi uses the stick to probe into the tiger's territory,
       testing his limits; Richard Parker gets angry, batting at the
       stick. Pi looks away, tries again, then turns to face Richard
       Parker, who growls, angry and begins batting at the stick.

                             PI
                 NO!
                                                                 54.


      Pi gives the tiger a stern glare. RP stops, stares back, then
      backs off.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Good.

      Pi reaches into a pouch behind his back, taking out a piece
      of fish. He places it on the end of the stick and reaches
      out, offering it to Richard Parker, who sniffs the air.

      Pi puts the fish on the bench. Richard Parker eats the fish,
      then backs up, growing calmer.

      Pi takes out another fish, reaches out to tap the bench, then
      tosses the fish on the bench. Richard Parker takes the fish,
      eats.

      Pi tosses the next piece near the edge of the tarp and taps,
      encouraging Richard Parker to follow his direction.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Go Richard Parker. Go. Go on home;
                I'll leave you alone. I'll respect
                that. I promise. Go, c'mon.

      Richard Parker stares at Pi. Pi raises his arms and yells,
      chasing Richard Parker around the bench and under the tarp.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Yes!

      Pi sits, the battle over.


137   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DAY                            137

      The sun is high. Pi raises the adjustable canopy he has
      rigged on his raft and sits beneath it. He feels the wind on
      his face and watches Richard Parker lounge in the stern of
      the lifeboat. Pi smiles, for a moment genuinely happy.

      He uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil, then
      begins writing in the margins of his survival manual, which
      are covered with journal entries...

      `LIFE IS GOOD' MONTAGE - Pi's raft has transformed again.
      Fish strips dry on lines; he has fashioned new tools, rigged
      an elaborate water collection system out of turtle shells,
      and a collapsible shade umbrella.

      - Pi trims his fingernails, a fish bone toothpick in his
      mouth.
                                                              55.


                          PI (WRITING - V.O.)
                I never thought a small piece of
                shade could bring me so much
                happiness. That a pile of tools - a
                bucket, a knife, a pencil- might
                become my greatest treasures. Or
                that knowing Richard Parker was
                here might ever bring me peace. In
                times like these, I remember that
                he has as little experience of the
                real world as I do. We were both
                raised in a zoo by the same master.
                Now we've been orphaned, left to
                face our ultimate master together.
                Without Richard Parker, I would
                have died by now. My fear of him
                keeps me alert. Tending to his
                needs gives my life purpose.


138   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                             138

      A school of dolphins, hundreds of them, pass in the distance,
      the blue sea roiling.

                          PI
                Dolphins, Richard Parker!

      Just beyond the school of dolphin, something else catches
      Pi's attention on the horizon - a freighter, much like the
      Tsimtsum, is within a few miles of their position.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Hey! HEY!! WE'RE HERE!! OVER HERE!!

      Pi scrambles to the storage locker, pulling out the flare
      gun. He loads and fires - the flare arcs high up into the
      air, a miniature white star leaving a bright trail of fire
      and smoke as it falls to the earth.

                                                        LATER -


139   EXT. RAFT - SUNSET                                          139

      It's grown noticeably darker. The freighter is far off now.


140   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                   140

      It is late now. Pi loads the last flare into his gun and
      raises it into the air - then stops. The freighter, now a
      fleck on the horizon, hasn't seen them. Pi watches as the
      dark form of the boat sinks from view.
                                                                  56.


       Pi fires one last time, staring up at the archways of smoke
       and the darkening sky. Pi lowers the flare gun. Richard
       Parker yawns and turns away.

                             PI (WRITING - V.O.)
                   Above all, don't lose hope...

       The flare burns a hole into the night.


141    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT, MONTHS LATER - DAY                       141

       HIGH ANGLE ("book cover" shot) - looking down on the boat,
       adrift in the middle of the ocean. Pi lies curled on the tarp
       in the bow; Richard Parker lies in the stern. Beneath the
       boat, the ocean swirls with traffic, including an enormous
       whale shark. It passes beneath the boat, the creature's form
       blotting out the depths.


A141   ONBOARD -                                                  A141


       A series of shots to show that Pi has grown gaunt, his eyes
       wild from exhaustion and endless solitude. The tarp has
       faded; the paint on the boat has become sun-bleached and
       weather- beaten. Pi's hair has grown long; his skin has
       darkened from olive-caramel to cocoa. The shirt has begun to
       take on a look of thread-worn transparency.

       He taps on the aluminum hull of the boat with his thumb in
       time with his recitation:

                             PI
                   ...645682948602814931815602496...


       EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT

       Richard Parker gazes into the distance;     Pi stares intently
       at the tiger.

                             PI
                   What are you looking at...? Tell
                   me. What do you see?

       The tiger turns and looks over the side of the boat into the
       water; Pi rises and looks over the side as well, staring into
       the depths...
                                                              57.


      RP'S POV - starting on his own reflection in the water and
      traveling downward, through schools of darting tuna, squid
      and lantern fish, past fleeting memories of a storm and zoo
      animals struggling to survive in churning waters and into the
      darkest recesses of the sea, Pi finding a broken ship and
      memories of a former life lying dormant on the ocean floor...

      OUT OF POV - Richard Parker looks over at Pi as he gazes into
      the water.

      Cut to an extremely wide shot of the boat floating in a sea
      of stars.

                          PI (WRITING - V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Words are all I have left to hang
                onto...


147   EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY                                      147

      Pi's fingers tremble as he writes in his manual, the tiny
      cramped letters barely legible, every white surface of the
      page covered.

                          PI (WRITING - V.O.)
                Everything mixed up, fragmented.
                Can't tell daydreams, night dreams
                from reality anym --

      The lead in his tiny stub of a pencil runs out, worn to a nub
      of wood. Pi slowly puts down his pencil, brooding.


148   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                  148

      Pi lies on the tarp, his position nearly unchanged, beating a
      drum rhythm on the hull, a wreck of conflicted thoughts and
      frayed nerves.

      We hear a distant rumble of thunder. Pi raises his head. Dark
      thunderclouds rise up over the horizon blackening the
      heavens. Another rumble of thunder, this one closer.

                          PI
                Storm! Storm, Richard Parker!


149   EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY                                      149

      Pi takes down the canopy on the raft. Pi begins quickly
      stowing his gear in the storage bench, beneath the tarp.
      Richard Parker flees to the safety of his den under the tarp.
      As Pi stows gear, he remembers his manual and takes it out
      from his waistband.
                                                               58.


      The storm front sweeps across the ocean in a squall line,
      high winds and rain striking Pi and the lifeboat with
      tremendous force. The manual slips from his hands and Pi is
      knocked off his feet and into the water. He lifts his head
      out of the water in time to watch the manual flying off into
      the storm.

                            PI
                No!

      The manual is gone. Pi ties himself to the lifeboat with a
      rope from the raft.


150   EXT. LIFEBOAT - DAY                                         150

      a stunning display of clouds and lightning fills the sky, as
      Pi looks on in awe. The sky lights up, a vivid white splinter
      of lightning crashing down from the sky, puncturing the water
      near the lifeboat. The water is shot through with what looks
      like the white roots of an enormous celestial tree; the clap
      of thunder is tremendous.

                          PI
                Praise be to God, Lord of All
                Worlds, the Compassionate, the
                Merciful!

      A wave washes Pi off of the tarp and onto the floor of the
      boat. Pi climbs onto the bench. He looks up in wonder at the
      sky, overwhelmed by the magnificence of the roiling clouds.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                It's beautiful... Where are you,
                Richard Parker? You have to see
                this!

      Another angle: he begins unbuttoning the tarp, calling
      excitedly to Richard Parker.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Come out Richard Parker! Come see
                the hand of God!

      Pi continues to unfasten the tarp.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Don't hide yourself! He's come to
                us! It's a miracle!

      A huge wave envelopes the lifeboat, submerging the craft
      completely - and then the boat pops to the surface like a
      cork. Pi resumes opening the tarp. He tears it aside,
      exposing the terrified animal to the storm.
                                                                 59.


                          PI (CONT'D)
                COME OUT AND SEE GOD RICHARD
                PARKER!

      The sky lights up all around them. The tiger begins roaring,
      pawing at the air, eyes wide, crazed with fear. Pi turns to
      face the storm.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                WHY ARE YOU SCARING HIM! I'VE LOST
                MY FAMILY - I'VE LOST EVERYTHING! I
                SURRENDER! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

      A wave washes Pi overboard, and the   raft comes crashing down
      on top of the lifeboat, then slides   away. Pi climbs back on
      board. He lies on the bench, coming   to his senses, realizing
      the extent of the danger they face.   He sees Richard Parker
      cowering miserably at the stern.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry Richard Parker!

      Pi crawls to the bow in time to see the raft, no longer tied
      to the lifeboat, drifting away. Pounded by rain and surf, he
      works his way around the edge of the boat, re-hooking the
      tarp to tarp hooks. With only four left unfastened along one
      side, he pulls himself under the tarp.


151   INT. THE LIFEBOAT, UNDER THE TARP - CONTINUOUS              151

      Thunder, rain and surf hammer the tarp from above; Pi pulls
      himself under the tarp. Richard Parker's grunts and labored
      breathing can be heard, but man and beast are only fully
      visible when lightning strikes, Pi trying to stay as far away
      from the tiger as he can manage. Before long the boat is
      tossing Pi and the tiger as though in a washing machine, the
      two helplessly colliding with one another, Pi choking as
      water splashes in.


152   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     152

      Pi wakes in the sloshing water under the tarp. Sunlight
      filters in from above. The storm has passed. Richard Parker
      lies listlessly in the side bench. Pi climbs out of the
      waterlogged hull. A double rainbow pierces majestic clouds,
      the sun breaking through.


153   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     153

      The gentle sound of water lapping at the side of the
      lifeboat; the breeze rattling the tarp. Time has passed;
                                                              60.


      life on the boat has grown tougher for Pi, his supplies more
      meager, since the raft was lost.

      Pi lies in the bow, exhausted, delirious. He pulls himself
      upright, takes a drink of water and looks around, confused.

      Richard Parker lies in the stern of the boat, severely
      emaciated, his coat dull, his eyes clouded. Shivering, Pi
      uses the last of his strength to drag himself over to the
      tiger. The animal's body is curled, his tail flat. Some of
      his fur has fallen away from his shoulders and haunches. He's
      a skeleton in an oversized bag of fur. Pi reaches out to
      place a hand on the tiger. He gently touches him on one spot.

                          PI
                We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm
                sorry.

      Pi sits and places the tiger's head on his lap.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                Amma, Appa, Ravi - I'm happy I'm
                going to see you soon.
                    (Pause)
                Can you feel the rain?

      Richard Parker raises his head slightly; his tail twitches.

                          PI (CONT'D)
                God, thank you for giving me my
                life. I'm ready now.


158   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE ISLAND - DAY                       158

      Pi lies, unconscious, in the bow of the lifeboat. Waves lap
      at the sides of the boat, which presses against the shore of
      an island.

      A gust of wind blows across Pi's face, tousling his hair. Pi
      gradually opens his eyes. A beat. He tips his head back.

      Pi's POV - above and behind him, the tops of trees.

      Pi turns, looking at the island, amazed. The trees have a
      pale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves, their color
      burning with a neon-like intensity. There is no sand; instead
      the ground is an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube-
      shaped seaweed, about two fingers in diameter.

      Pi turns to look back to the stern; he calls under the tarp.

                          PI
                Richard Parker?
                                                              61.


      Pi rises, stepping out of the boat. The seaweed is rubbery -
      uncertain ground. His legs are wobbly. He hooks the gaff on a
      root and falls to the ground. Pi tears up a piece of the
      seaweed and examines it. He takes an experimental bite. Soon
      he's grabbing handfuls of the seaweed, eating as fast as he
      can.

      Pi climbs the ridge on unsteady legs. A forest comes into
      view with nearly symmetrical ponds dotting the island here
      and there, many of them reaching 40 feet in diameter.

      Half the island seems to be covered with meerkats - thousands
      of them standing together in groups all over the island. The
      moment the first of the meerkats notices Pi, it turns and
      stands on its hind legs - and the others immediately follow
      suit.


      EXT. THE ISLAND - DAY

      Pi walks slowly forward, taking in the meerkats and the
      island. Gradually, the meerkats return to all fours - their
      squeaking and barking noises coming and going in waves
      throughout the herd. They pay him so little attention that Pi
      has to shove them aside with his legs in order to walk.

                          PI
                Excuse me... Go on, move!

      Pi walks beyond the throng of meerkats toward a pond, pausing
      to examine the fish bones that litter the edge of one of the
      ponds. The edge is steep; he gets too close, slips down the
      side and into the water. Pi tastes the water. He begins a
      gentle, blissful breaststroke across the pond.

      Pi hears a commotion. He lifts himself up to peer over at the
      meerkats. In the distance, Richard Parker blazes a trail
      through the meerkats, catching, pinning and eating as many as
      he can. Pi smiles, watching the tiger.

                                                         LATER:


164   EXT. THE TREE - SUNSET                                   164

      Pi sits cradled in a nest of branches, rigging a hammock. As
      the last rays of the sun disappear, he hears a commotion
      below on the island and pushes aside branches to see better.
      The meerkats are abandoning the ponds, scurrying up onto land
      and running for the forest, their collective stampede noisier
      than a herd of elephants. Richard Parker, in the meantime,
      runs for the shoreline, scrambling down the ridge as fast as
      possible and leaping into the lifeboat.
                                                                 62.


      The trunk beneath Pi is swarmed as meerkats settle upon all
      the branches in the tree. Several invade Pi's hammock,
      sitting on him, climbing over him, making themselves
      comfortable at his expense.

                          PI
                Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get
                away. This is my bed!

      Pi shoves them off as best he can and settles in for the
      night.


165   EXT. UP IN THE TREE - NIGHT                                 165

      Pi sleeps, nestled in the branches of the tree.

      Meerkats snore - at least one of them in the branches beneath
      Pi does. Pi wakes up, staring grumpily into the darkness at
      the noisy offender.

      He is amazed to discover that what he can see of the island
      from his perch is bioluminescent. The leaves of the tree
      around him and the seaweed below all glow in gentle greens,
      while the ponds beneath seem to shimmer like liquid silver -
      it is a scene at once beautiful and threatening.

      Pi hears a burbling noise coming from the pond at the center
      of the tree. He looks down; fish bubble to the surface. One
      of the larger fish writhes in agony at the surface before
      falling still along with the others.

      Pi watches as the water below begins churning with the bodies
      of the dead fish, the surface of the water aswirl with the
      flash of fins - then gradually the fish begin to disappear,
      as though slowly dissolving in the water. Pi stares at the
      mysterious pool, then looks out over the island to where the
      lifeboat is anchored along shore -

      Richard Parker is visible, sitting in the boat, staring up at
      the island.


166   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                   166

      CLOSE ON RICHARD PARKER staring into the night.


168   EXT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                       168

      WIDE ANGLE - looking over the tiger's shoulder, taking in the
      entire island. From this distance, it looks - and sounds - as
      though the island is gently expanding and contracting with
      the tides... as though it is breathing.
                                                                63.


169   EXT. UP IN THE TREE - NIGHT                                169

      Pi notices fruit growing on one of the branches above his
      head. He looks around at the rest of the tree, but the fruit
      only seems to grow along the one branch. Pi plucks one of the
      fruits and examines it. Each stem that he pulls causes a leaf
      to peel off. He reaches the center of the ball, peeling back
      the last of the leaves, to reveal a tooth.

                It was human tooth?

                          ADULT PI
                Don't you see, the island was
                carnivorous.

                          WRITER
                Carnivorous? Like... a Venus
                flytrap?

                          ADULT PI
                Yes, the whole island - the plants,
                the water in those pools, the very
                ground itself. During the day,
                those pools held fresh water, but
                at night, some chemical process
                turned the water in those pools
                into acid - acid that dissolved
                those fish, that sent the meerkats
                scurrying into the trees and
                Richard Parker running to the boat.

                          WRITER
                But where did the tooth come from?

                          ADULT PI
                Years ago, some poor fellow just
                like me must have found himself
                stranded on that island.... And
                like me he thought he might stay
                there forever. But all that the
                island gave him by day, it took
                away again by night. To think - how
                many hours spent with only meerkats
                for company? How much loneliness
                taken on?

                          ADULT PI (CONT'D)
                All I know is that eventually he
                died, and the island digested him,
                leaving behind only his teeth. I
                saw how my life would end if I
                stayed on that island. Alone and
                forgotten. I had to go back to the
                world, or die trying.


171   EXT. ISLAND/LIFEBOAT - DAY                               171

      Pi loads the boat with water and meerkats; the tarp is piled
      high with roots and seaweed.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                I spent the next day preparing the
                boat. I filled my stores with fresh
                water, ate seaweed until my stomach
                could take no more, and brought as
                many meerkats as I could fit into
                the storage locker for Richard
                Parker. I couldn't leave without
                him, of course - it would mean
                killing him. And so I waited for
                his return. I knew he wouldn't be
                late.

      He blows his whistle, calling:

                          PI
                RICHARD PARKER!


172   EXT. THE ISLAND/LIFEBOAT - SUNSET                        172

      Richard Parker runs down the ridge and jumps into the stern.
      Pi climbs aboard and shoves off.

                                                        CUT TO:


173   EXT. OCEAN NEAR ISLAND - LIFEBOAT - SUNSET               173

      Pi and the tiger watch as the island recedes into the
      distance, lit by the late afternoon sun.

                          PI (V.O)
                No one has ever seen that floating
                island since; you won't read about
                those trees in any nature book. And
                yet if I hadn't found those shores,
                I would have died. And if I hadn't
                discovered that tooth, I would have
                been lost, alone forever.

                          PI (V.O) (CONT'D)
                Even when God seemed to have
                abandoned me, He was watching.
                Even when He seemed indifferent to
                my suffering, He was watching. And
                when I was beyond all hope of
                saving, He gave me rest, then gave
                me a sign to continue my journey.


177   EXT. THE MEXICAN COAST/THE JUNGLE - DAY                     177

      Pi leans over the side of the lifeboat. He falls overboard.
      We follow him underwater, his feet - hit a sandy bottom.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                By the time we reached the Mexican
                shore, I was afraid to let go of
                the boat. My strength was gone. I
                was so weak. I was afraid that in
                two feet of water, so close to
                deliverance, I would drown. I
                struggled to shore and fell upon
                the sand. It was warm and soft,
                like pressing my face against the
                cheek of God. And somewhere two
                eyes were smiling at having me
                there.

      An empty coastline, nothing but sand, rocks and jungle. Pi
      struggles to bring the lifeboat ashore. Richard Parker is
      hiding under the tarp, nowhere to be seen. Pi pulls the
      painter line until the boat is on the beach, then collapses
      on the sand.


177   EXT. THE MEXICAN COAST/THE JUNGLE - DAY                     177

      Pi collapses on the beach. He hears Richard Parker coming a
      moment before he sees him; Pi turns, looking up as the tiger
      jumps over the boy, stretching in the air above him and
      landing in the water ahead of him.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                I was so spent I couldn't move. And
                so Richard Parker went ahead of me.

      Richard Parker walks along the beach, his gait clumsy and
      uncoordinated from so much time spent at sea.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                He stretched his legs and walked
                along the shore.
                                                              66.


      Richard Parker stops, staring ahead into the forest, his back
      to the boy. Pi watches the tiger from behind, Richard
      Parker's ribs gently rising and falling as he smells the
      jungle air.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.)
                At the edge of the jungle, he
                stopped. I was certain he was going
                to look back at me, flatten his
                ears to his head, growl - that he'd
                bring our relationship to an end in
                some way. But he just stared ahead
                into the jungle.


178   INT. PI'S HOME, DINING ROOM, MONTREAL - SUNSET           178

      On Adult Pi alone:

                          ADULT PI
                And then Richard Parker, my fierce
                companion, the terrible one who
                kept me alive, disappeared forever
                from my life.


181   EXT. THE MEXICAN COAST/THE JUNGLE - DAY                  181

      Pi lies on the sand a few yards from the water. A group of
      six MEXICAN LOCALS hurry down the beach to him.

                          ADULT PI
                After a few hours, a member of my
                own species found me. He left and
                returned with a group who carried
                me away.

      Pi sobs uncontrollably as they carry him to safety.

                          ADULT PI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I wept like a child, not because I
                was overwhelmed at having survived,
                although I was. I was weeping
                because Richard Parker left me
                so... unceremoniously. It broke my
                heart.


174   INT. PI'S HOME - DINING ROOM - MONTREAL - NEAR SUNSET    174

      It is near sunset, the light from the windows casting theroom
      in a golden hue - the same lighting we have just seen as Pi
      was leaving the island.
                                                       67.


                    ADULT PI
          You know, my father was right.
          Richard Parker never saw me as his
          friend. After all we'd been
          through, he didn't even look back.
          But I have to believe that there
          was more in his eyes than my own
          reflection staring back at me. I
          know I felt it - even if I can't
          prove it. I just wish...
              (Beat. He sighs.)
          You know, I've left so much behind.
          My family, the zoo, Anandi, India -
          I suppose in the end the whole of
          life becomes an act of letting go.
          But what always hurts the most is
          not taking the moment to say
          goodbye. I was never able to thank
          my father for all I learned from
          him, to tell him that without his
          lessons I would never have
          survived...
          And I know he's a tiger, but I wish
          I'd said: 'It's over. We've
          survived. Thank you for saving my
          life. I love you, Richard Parker.
          You will always be with me. May God
          be with you.'

The Writer shakes his head, astonished.

                    WRITER
          I don't know what to say.

                    ADULT PI
          Hard to believe, isn't it?

A pause as the writer decides how to respond.

                    WRITER
          It is a lot to take in, to figure
          out what it all means.

                    ADULT PI
          If it happened, it happened. Why
          should it have to mean anything?

                    WRITER
          Well, some of it is pretty
          incredible.

Pi nods - a half-smile - then rises, crossing to the
bookshelf.
                                                               68.


                           ADULT PI
                 I was the only one who survived the
                 shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping
                 company sent two men to talk to me
                 in the Mexican hospital where I was
                 recovering. I still have a copy of
                 their report.

       Pi takes a tattered notebook out of the bookcase.

                           ADULT PI (CONT'D)
                 They had insurance claims to
                 settle, and they wanted to find out
                 why the ship sank. They didn't
                 believe me either.

       Pi hands the notebook to the Writer. On top, there is a
       newspaper article with the headline "BOY RESCUED: 227 DAYS IN
       THE PACIFIC." The Writer unclips the article, revealing the
       insurance report beneath. We hear Okamoto's first line over
       the report.

                 Thousands of meerkats? On a
                 floating carnivorous island? And no
                 one has ever seen it?

                           YOUNG PI
                 Yes. Just like I told you.

                           CHIBA
                 Bananas don't float.

                           OKAMOTO
                     (In Japanese:)
                 Why are you talking about bananas?

                           CHIBA
                 You said the orangutan floated to
                 you on a bundle of bananas. But
                 bananas don't float.

                           OKAMOTO
                     (In Japanese:)
                 Are you sure about that?

                           YOUNG PI
                 Of course they do. Try it for
                 yourself.
                                               69.


                   OKAMOTO
         In any case, we are not here to
         talk about bananas or meerkats.

                   YOUNG PI
         I've just told you a long story.
         I'm very tired.

                   OKAMOTO
         We're here because a Japanese cargo
         ship sank in the Pacific.

                   YOUNG PI
         Something I never forget. I lost my
         whole family.

Pause.

                    OKAMOTO
             (In Japanese:)
         Get him some water.
             (In English:)
         We don't mean to push you. And you
         have our deepest sympathies. But
         we've come a long way. And we're no
         closer to understanding why the
         ship sank.

                   YOUNG PI
         Because I don't know. I was asleep.
         Something woke me up. It may have
         been an explosion; I can't be sure.
         And then the ship sank. What else
         do you want from me?

                   CHIBA (OFF)
         A story that won't make us look
         like fools.

                   OKAMOTO
         We need a simpler story for our
         report. One our company can
         understand. A story we can all
         believe.
             (Chiba gives Pi a glass of
              water.)

                   YOUNG PI
         So.... a story without things you
         never seen before.

                   OKAMOTO
         That's right.
                                                           70.


                           YOUNG PI
                 Without surprises. Without animals
                 or islands.

                           OKAMOTO
                 Yes. The truth.

                           YOUNG PI
                 ...The cook and the sailor were
                 already onboard. The cook threw me
                 a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard.
                 Mother held onto some bananas and
                 made it to the lifeboat. The cook,
                 the cook was a disgusting man. He
                 ate a rat. We had food enough for
                 weeks, but he found the rat in the
                 first few days - and he killed it,
                 and dried it in the sun and ate it.
                 He was such a brute, that man. But
                 he was resourceful. It was his idea
                 to build the raft to catch fish. We
                 would have died in those first few
                 days without him. The sailor was
                 the same man who brought rice with
                 gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't
                 understand much of what he said,
                 only that he was suffering. I can
                 still hear him - the happy Buddhist
                 who only ate rice with gravy. He
                 had broken his leg horribly in the
                 fall. We tried to set it as best we
                 could, but the leg became infected
                 and the cook told us we had to do
                 something or he'd die. The cook
                 said he'd do it, but mother and I
                 had to hold the man down. And I
                 believed him - we needed to do it.

            YOUNG PI (CONT'D)
So... I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm
sorry", but he just kept.. looking
at me, his eyes so... I'll never
understand the point of that man's
suffering. We didn't save him, of
course. He died. The morning after,
the cook caught his first dorado,
and I didn't understand what he'd
done at first, but Mother did, and
I'd never seen her so angry. 'Stop
whining and be happy,' he said. "We
need more food or we'll die. That
was the whole point.' 'What was the
point?' Mother asked. "You let that
poor boy die in order to get bait?
You monster!' The cook got furious.
He started towards her with his
fists raised, and Mother slapped
him hard, right across the face. I
was stunned. I thought he was going
to kill her right then. But he
didn't. The cook didn't stop at
bait either, no. The sailor, he
went the same way the rat went -
the cook was a resourceful man. It
was a week later that he... Because
of me. Because I couldn't hold onto
a stupid turtle. It slipped out of
my hands and swam away and the cook
came up and punched me on the side
of the head and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars. I thought he was
going to hit me again, but then
Mother started pounding on him with
her fists and screaming, "MONSTER!
MONSTER!" She yelled at me to go to
the raft - "Nee poda!" I thought
she was coming with me or I'd never
have... I don't know why I didn't
make her go first. I think about
that every day. I jumped over and
turned back just as the knife came
out. There wasn't anything I could
do; I couldn't look away... He
threw her body overboard. Then the
sharks came. I saw what they... I
saw. The next day I killed him. He
didn't even fight back. He knew he
had gone too far, even by his
standards. He'd left the knife out
on the bench. And I did to him what
he did to the sailor. He was such
an evil man, but worse still, he
brought the evil out in me.

                          YOUNG PI (CONT'D)
                I have to live with that. I was
                alone in a lifeboat, drifting
                across the Pacific Ocean. And I
                survived.

                          ADULT PI
                After that, no more questions. The
                investigators didn't seem to like
                the story, exactly - but they
                thanked me, they wished me well,
                and they left.

      Pause. The Writer speaks his thoughts aloud as the
      realization strikes.


                            WRITER
                So...  the stories... Both the zebra
                and the sailor broke their leg. And
                the hyena killed the zebra and the
                orangutan. So ... the hyena is the
                cook. And the sailor is the zebra,
                mother is the orangutan... and
                you're... the tiger.


                          ADULT PI
                Can I ask you something?

                             WRITER
                Of course.

                          ADULT PI
                I've told you two stories about
                what happened out on the ocean.
                Neither explains what caused the
                sinking of the ship, and no one can
                prove which story is true and which
                is not. In both stories, the ship
                sinks, my family dies, and I
                suffer.

                             WRITER
                True.

                          ADULT PI
                So which story do you prefer?

                          WRITER
                The story with the tiger. That's
                the better story.
                                                          73.


                    ADULT PI
              (Heartfelt:)
          Thank you. And so it goes with God.

                    WRITER
              (Pause. He looks up.)
          Mamaji was right. It is an amazing
          story. Will you really let me write
          it?

                    ADULT PI
          Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji
          sent you here, after all?

They hear a car pulling into the alleyway alongside the
house.

                    ADULT PI (CONT'D)
          My wife is here. Would you like to
          stay for dinner? She's an
          incredible cook.

                    WRITER
          I didn't know you had a wife.

                    ADULT PI
          And a cat, and two children.

                    WRITER
          So your story does have a happy
          ending.

                     ADULT PI
          Well, that's up to you. The story's
          yours now.

The Writer smiles. Outside, car doors slam; we hear voices as
Pi's wife and children cross around to the front. Pi rises
and moves to the door. The Writer glances one final time at
the report. He flips the page and hesitates, reading the last
few lines aloud.

                    WRITER
              (Reading:)
          "Mr. Patel's is an astounding story
          of courage and endurance

                you...

      THE WRITER stands and faces Pi. We see his POV - on Pi,
      holding his daughter in arms, surrounded by his family,
      smiling...

183   EXT. THE MEXICAN COAST/THE JUNGLE - DAY                     183

      YOUNG PI'S POV of Richard Parker from behind as he stares
      into the jungle, the tiger's ribs gently rising and falling
      as he smells the jungle air - and then he walks forward and
      disappears into the swaying trees.

      The moment that the tiger is out of view, all the color
      drains out of Pi's world; his view of the trees loses all
      dimension and fades to black and white as we...

PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE 
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.








FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT											

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY	

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER	

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR	

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7 		OUT

8		WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR						

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10		WITH THE RUNNER			

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)								

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12		P.O.V.		

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13		THE SANDMAN			

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE			

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15		THE SANDMAN		

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)	

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)		

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR		

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19		OUT

19X1		LOGAN 			

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

						LOGAN
			Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2		FRANCIS

entering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?
	
						LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!
	
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

						FRANCIS               
			You should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!

						FRANCIS    
			Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

						FRANCIS 
			Okay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

						LOGAN 
			Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
						LOGAN
			Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

						VOICE 
			Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.

						LOGAN 
			Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

						VOICE
			Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

						VOICE
			Sleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

						FRANCIS
			You need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
						LOGAN 
			Has anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?

						FRANCIS 
					(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?

						LOGAN 
			just wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

						LOGAN 
			but you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."

						FRANCIS 
			Well, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?
 

						LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.

						FRANCIS
			Well the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

						MAN
			Well? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -

						MAN 
			Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?

						WOMAN 
			Too little.

						MAN 
			Too little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

						LOGAN
			Did you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

						FRANCIS 
			I don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

						FRANCIS
			and that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

						FRANCIS 
			You're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

						WOMAN
			That's all right. Happy turn.

						2ND WOMAN
			You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.

						2ND WOMAN 
			I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.

						WOMAN
			Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
						FRANCIS
			I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

						FRANCIS
			You missed something special.

						LOGAN
			Well...you can't have them all.

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
					(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

						FRANCIS 
			The damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
	
						LOGAN 
			You should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.
	
						FRANCIS
			Damn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .
	
						LOGAN
			Want me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anyway
		
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.		ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

						LOGAN 
			Now there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.
	
						FRANCIS 
			Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36	    OUT

37		PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38 		OUT

38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39		THE CROWD	

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40		LASTDAY GROUP	

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41		CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42		CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43		CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44		CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45		LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46		CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
		
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN		

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD	

Hysterical...starting to chant...

						CROWD 
			Renew!

The man continues to strain:

						CROWD 
			Renew!

51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

Almost a blur...but still straining:
		
						CROWD'S CHANT
			Renew!

52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS
					(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!

53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

						CROWD'S CHANT 
			Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL	

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS		

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56 		OUT

57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS			

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

			MAN: RELIVE STORE 14		
			
					 	LOGAN 
					(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.
		
Francis stands.
		
						LOGAN
			Who invited you?

						FRANCIS
			I'm in my party mood.
		
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN 		

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.	

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1		    OUT

63X2		WITH LOGAN	

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER			

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
	
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6		LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

						LOGAN
			Runner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.
	
						FRANCIS
			Yes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
	
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY	

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.	
					
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
		
63X11		2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
			
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
			
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

						FRANCIS 
			...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

						FRANCIS 
					(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
	
63X15		LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17		BACK TO LOGAN	

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
		
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS	

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19		LOGAN		
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS		

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE	

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
		
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

						LOGAN
			What's wrong, Available?

						JESSICA 
					(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

						LOGAN
			Please . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.

						JESSICA 
			No. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.

						LOGAN 
			You prefer women?

						JESSICA 
			No.

						LOGAN
			Well then...?

						JESSICA
			Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.

						LOGAN 
			Sad? What made you sad?
	
						JESSICA 		
			A friend of mine went on Carousel		
			tonight. Now he's gone.	
		
						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			Yes...probably he was renewed?

						JESSICA 
					(flatly)
			He was killed

						LOGAN
			Killed? Why do you use that word?

						JESSICA
			Isn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.

						LOGAN
			I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
			Sandmen terminate  Runners
					(a beat)
			Who brought you?

						JESSICA 
			Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
			on the circuit.

						LOGAN
			You felt sad. What's your name?

						JESSICA
			Jessica.

						LOGAN 
					(matter-of-fact)
			You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						LOGAN
			Later.

						JESSICA
			No.	

						LOGAN
			But you put yourself on the circuit!

						JESSICA
			I thought I had to do something.
		
						LOGAN			
			And?				

						JESSICA
			I changed my mind

						LOGAN
			And now?
	
						JESSICA
			Curious.

						LOGAN
			About what?
							
						JESSICA
			How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

						LOGAN
			Let's have sex.
					(as Jessica shakes her head)
			I thought you were curious.
						
						JESSICA
			Not about that.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			I'm listening.

						JESSICA
			I'm afraid to tell you.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			I'm not armed.
					(a beat)
			Well?

						JESSICA
			Why is it wrong to run?				

						LOGAN
			You shouldn't even think such things...
					(smiles)
			And you picked a strange person to
			say them to - 
		
						JESSICA
			I suppose. But what if you want
			to live?

						LOGAN
			So? Do what everyone does. Try
			like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

						LOGAN
			When this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...
			you have the same chance as everyone 
			else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

						LOGAN 		(playfully) 
			But if you're one of the misfits... 
			that's where I come in.

						JESSICA (somewhat
					frightened)
			I didn't say that I would run...
			I Just...

						LOGAN (interrupting;
					turning over her palm)
			Are you a 5 or a 6?
					(we see a green crystal)

						JESSICA
			Six. I go red next year.

						LOGAN
			You're years away . . . I don't know
			why you're thinking of these things,
			much less talking about them.
					(offering Jessica the gun) 
			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

						LOGAN
			What Quad do you live in?

						JESSICA 
			K.

						LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

						LOGAN 	
			It's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.

						LOGAN
			It's nice co know you can do that,
			too.
	
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
	
						FRANCIS
			These are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?
	
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

						LOGAN
			What happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

						LOGAN
			How come?

						SANDMAN
			Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
					(as they stare)
			One of them cut me bad... 
					(extends his arm and moves 
					a finger from his shoulder to 
					his wrist)
			all the way down.
					
						FRANCIS
					(with anger)	
			CUBS!	
		
						SANDMAN (shrug)
			On my way to the New You for repairs.

						LOGAN 
			Get yourself a new face while you're 
			at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1	    OUT
		
64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
		
						LOGAN
			I just might look in on New You 483
			myself.

						FRANCIS 
			You? Why? You're already beautiful.

						LOGAN 
			No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
			in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?
	
					FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last night
		
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68	OUT

69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
 	  
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.	
			
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
	|	
			IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
	
			CLEAR
			FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

						FRANCIS
			See you in the hydrotoner!
		
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

		PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
	
		APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
		
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

		IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

		OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
		PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED 
		WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. 
		PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. 
		QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?

						LOGAN
			Negative. Question: What is it?
	
Words on SCREEN now read:

		PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
		NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
		IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?

						LOGAN
			Negative.

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
		ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING 
		PLACE OF IMMUNITY.

						LOGAN
			I don't understand?

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY 
		RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED 
		CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:

Word on SCREEN now reads:	

		HOLD
	
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

		OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED 
		WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. 
		CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... 
		RUNNER GOAL.

						LOGAN 
			1056 unaccounted for?!

Word on SCREEN reads:

		CORRECT

						LOGAN
			Impossible!
					(Rising tone) 
			Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. 
			Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal 
			on Carousel.

Words on SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED
		CITIZENS 1056...

						LOGAN 
			Question: None of them reached renewal?

Word on SCREEN reads:

		ZERO

						LOGAN
			But everyone believes that some....

Words on SCREEN read:

		ANSWER: ZERO
		UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS
		NUMBER 1056....LOGAN-
		5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE
		SANCTUARY AND REPORT....

						LOGAN 
			Question: You mean nobody's ever 
			been renewed?

Words on SCREEN read:

		- - QUESTION ANSWERED....
		ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...

As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:	
			
		AUTHORIZATION TO	
		PENETRATE CITY SEALS...

						LOGAN (startled)
			The Seal......
					(Breaks off)
			Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:

		SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
		FIND		
		DESTROY

						LOGAN
			I will.
	
The words on the SCREEN read:

		ASSIGNMENT SECRET.

						LOGAN
			Question:
					(a beat)
			What if I need help from another
			Sandman?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT 
		SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO 
		RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
		
Logan takes a breath.

						LOGAN
			Question: I am six Red...how can
			I pretend to be approaching Lastday?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK--ALTER

						LOGAN
			My Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?
			
The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK-ALTER

						LOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

						LOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

		CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY	

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
						
						FRANCIS
			What the hell took you so long?

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?

						FRANCIS 
			I think you've been skulling out too 
			much. First Nursery and now stupid 
			questions.

						LOGAN 
			Did you?

						FRANCIS 
			Of course.

						LOGAN 
			Anybody we know?

						FRANCIS 
			Look....why don't you get into the 
			water....you need it....more than I do.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			I'm fine....
					(walking away)
			See you....

						FRANCIS 
			At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING	

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

						LOGAN 
					(into box)
			Location...female Green Six...
			name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73 	OUT

73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...

						LOGAN
			She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

						JESSICA
			You could have called me yourself.

						LOGAN
			But I wasn't sure you'd come.

						JESSICA 
					(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

						LOGAN
			I couldn't get you out of my mind.

						JESSICA
			I'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?

						LOGAN
			Maybe...sure....

						JESSICA
			Thanks...but I have the choice.
				
						LOGAN	
			Of course.		
						
						JESSICA	
			Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

						JESSICA	
			You can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?				

						LOGAN
			You know

						JESSICA
			I don't believe you. There has to
			be more.

						LOGAN
			All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

						JESSICA
			Why show me?

						LOGAN
			I'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?

						LOGAN
			You know something.
	
						JESSICA
			About running, dying what?

						LOGAN
			Both...running's what I'm interested
			in.

						JESSICA
			I know what everyone knows. Try
			like hell for Renewal. You have
			the same chance everyone else has.

						LOGAN
			It's different now. Help me.

						JESSICA
			How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

						JESSICA
			Where did you get that?

						LOGAN
			A Runner gave it to me.

						JESSICA 	
			And then you killed him, right?				

						LOGAN
			I let him go...believe me.

						JESSICA
			I don't..

						LOGAN (a beat)
			Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
			please...

						JESSICA
			Please? What friends?

						LOGAN 
				(clutching the ankh, looking 
				at Jessica's; then:)
			I don't have much time.

						JESSICA
			I never heard of a Sandman running
			. . . ever. . .

						LOGAN (putting the
			ankh in his pocket;
			dropping the bombshell)
			And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

						LOGAN
			What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81	OUT 

82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83		CLOSE ON - LOGAN	

A distance away...watching.

84-85 	OUT	 

86		EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
		WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

						SECOND MAN 
			He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
			old, too.

						FIRST MAN
			But what if he's telling the truth?

						THIRD MAN
			I say no. It's not worth the risk.

						WOMAN
			I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
			for a decade. He has no feelings.

						JESSICA
			He was born a Sandman. He had no
			choice.

						WOMAN 
			Neither do we.

87-88 	OUT

88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM	

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
		
						1ST SANDMAN
			Thanks, Francis.
		
						FRANCIS (taking his
					place at the console)
			Just don't be forever about it like last 
			time.

						1ST SANDMAN
			Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
			you'll miss a really good Run.		

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
			
						SECOND MAN (urgently)	
			If he believes you, he'll come.	
			
						JESSICA	
			Why Arcade Station?
			
						SECOND MAN (impatiently)
			Why? It's our only chance--kill him
			and get away in the crowd heading
			for the evening slaughter --
				
						JESSICA
			Right at the station itself?

						MAN
			No - just there - on the first level.
					(beat)
			Don't look for us. We'll see you.

						WOMAN (cutting in)
			You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
					(beat)
			Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

						THIRD MAN
			Tonight?

						JESSICA (stalling)
			Y-yes...if I can find him.

						WOMAN
			I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

						WOMAN  
			I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
			about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
			dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

						SECOND MAN 
					(staring at Jessica) 
			We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92	OUT

93-94 	OUT

94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS	

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
	
94X1		WITH JESSICA		

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

						LOGAN
			Are you here to help me?
	
						JESSICA
			What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4 	OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
		
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

						JESSICA
			What're you going to do?

						LOGAN
			That's tomorrow.

						JESSICA 
					(turning away slightly)
			I wish I could help you.

						LOGAN 
					(turning her gently back)
			Maybe you'll chink of something...

						JESSICA 
					(hating herself)		
			I wish I knew what you think I know.		

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
		
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE		

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						LOGAN
			If you did know, you'd tell me.
					
						JESSICA
			Of course--

						LOGAN (overriding)
			If you trusted me, you'd know.
				
						JESSICA (evading it)
			We're coming to Arcade.
					(beat)	-
			Shall we Relive together?
	
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9 	OUT

94AX9	READY ROOM	

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL	

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12	FEATURING JESSICA	

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13	THE AMBUSHERS	

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
	
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

						LOGAN 
			Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
	
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

		RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
		...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:		

						1ST SANDMAN
			Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
			why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105 	OUT

105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH	

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1	OUT

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

						LOGAN
			A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE	

						JESSICA
			You're not going, are you?
		
						LOGAN (a beat)
			Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
			You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
	
						JESSICA (touching his
					arm)
			I'd rather be with you.
	
						LOGAN (knowing she is
					lying through her teeth)
			That's nice.
		
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

107-
109X1 	OUT
		
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

110-
120 		OUT

121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT

						LOGAN
			Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

						LOGAN
			They're like beasts. Wild.
	
						JESSICA		
			Maybe they're angry because they're
			grown in meccano-breeders.

						LOGAN (interrupting,
					grimacing) 
			Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
			woman:
					(ugh) 
			We're all raised the same but most of 
			us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

						JESSICA 
			Some people say children need human 
			mothering.

						LOGAN 
			Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
			mother could be.

						JESSICA 
			I'm only telling you what I've heard...
					(slightest beat) 
			Haven't you ever wondered what your 
			seed-mother was Like...?

						LOGAN 
			Uh-uh.

						JESSICA 
			I have.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			When did you begin to question Lastday?

						JESSICA 
			I don't remember exactly...except I was 
			a Green.
					(another beat) 
			What would you like to relive, Logan?

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

						VOICE			
			Attention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.

121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION	

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

						JESSICA
			I've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?
		
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
		
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

						LOGAN 
			Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...

						LOGAN
			Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?
	
						LOGAN (as they enter	
					the corridor)	
			The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
			there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
			dazzle, they'd just go past us--
					(gesture)
			too fast

						JESSICA
			Muscle? I don't know that one.
	
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
	
						LOGAN
			It's unauthorized. No good for any-
			one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
			to pieces--speeds everything up to a
			blur--
					(he is amused)
			you can see what happens when some
			flying Cub tries to go through this
			on muscle--splat!
	
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
	
124		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

						JESSICA
			What's your name?

						MARY
			I'm Mary 2.

						JESSICA
			Where do you live, Mary?

						MARY
			Here.

						JESSICA			
			Why aren't you in Nursery?			

						MARY
			I'm very smart.

						JESSICA
			When do you go up?

						MARY
			I never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

						LOGAN
			Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.	
		
As Logan whirls:	
		
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE	

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

						BILLY 
					(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
			one later. Right now I think we've got 
			a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

						A VOICE 
			We're going to have ourselves a time, 
			we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

						LOGAN		
			I'm a Sandman!		

						BILLY
			I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
			said I'd never get him...but I cut
			him up good, I did.

						LOGAN (firm tone)
			I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

						BILLY
			For me? Better feel sorry for your-
			self, Sandman!

						LOGAN
			No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

						LOGAN 
			Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
			out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
			months?
					(he points to the yellow
					flower in Billy's palm)
			What happens when you're sixteen and
			you go green?

						BILLY (lashing out) 
			Nothing will happen! I make the
			rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
			Always have! Always will! I got
			Cathedral and I'll never let go!

						LOGAN 
			No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
			heard of a cub with a green flower? 
			You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
			when you're on green, because they 
			won't let a green stay here.
					(slightest beat) 
			If you try to stay the young ones will 
			gut-rip you apart!

						BILLY
			Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

						ANOTHER VOICE	
			Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut	
			his mouth! Let's watch him shake		
			himself to death!!
		
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
			
						A VOICE
			Give him some Muscle!!
		
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
			
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Watching..terrified.

127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
	
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
				
						ANOTHER VOICE
			Shake him to death!!

						A VOICE 
			Kill him!

128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
	
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

						BILLY (chilling laugh) 
			He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

						BILLY		
			We can rush him...we can take 	
			can take him	again, we can!!	

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

						LOGAN 
					(moving the gun slowly 
					back and forth)
			All right! How many of you want this to 
			be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
			a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			They've got someone else! Why would 
			anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN	

frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

watching

131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

						WOMAN (nearing
					hysteria)
			There's been a terrible error! My
			Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
					(rising tone)
			I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
			me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
			green! Did you hear me?
					(shouting)
			Green!

						LOGAN (quietly)
			Don't be afraid--	

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
	
						WOMAN
			I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

						LOGAN (breathing hard) 
			I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

						LOGAN	
			If they find you throw this hard	
			enough to break it. Then hold your	
			breath till you get away...It's
			blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
		
132		EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - 
		MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING

He is shocked, unbelieving.
	
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
		
						FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
					tone)
			Runner!
		
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN	

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136		FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

						FRANCIS (quietly)
			Runner terminated at G.16
			Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
			Quadrant 39.
			
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

						SECOND MAN
			I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 	

				 		JESSICA
			I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
			to be killed.

						LOGAN
			Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
			me there?	

						JESSICA 
			Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
			But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

						LOGAN (a beat) 
			All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
			Runner.

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
			They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
			now...

						LOGAN (wry laugh) 
			That's nothing...there's a Sandman
			behind us, too and there'll be
			more soon. Take me to them.

						JESSICA (torn) 
			I - I can't.

						LOGAN
			Then - why don't you leave me - go
			to them - explain

						JESSICA 
			No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

						LOGAN
			All right. New You 483. I'll find
			out myself.

139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

		IDENTIFY	

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

		REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

						SANDMAN
			What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:	
		
						FRANCIS
			Can you beat it....I've got the damn
			wrong bag.

						SANDMAN 
			You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
			Francis.

						FRANCIS (starting out) 
			Yeah....

140		EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142		INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Hello, Sandman.

						LOGAN 
			Hello.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

						RECEPTIONIST	
			We don't get many Sandmen. I think
			we've only had one other since I've
			been here.

						LOGAN (brusquely) 
			A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
			as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

						RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
			I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
			took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
			your face to somebody else.

						LOGAN
			It's all right with me. Is he here?

						RECEPTIONIST
			My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
			ancient times they said my number
			was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

						LOGAN
			No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

						HOLLY
			Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
			This is my third...
					(a beat) 
			... I did it when I turned yellow ...
			and green.
					(showing her palm) 
			I turned red yesterday.

						LOGAN (looking) 
			Beautiful work. This man do them all?

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
			seen any of his work?

						LOGAN	
			Just one. 
		
						HOLLY
			Doc's ready, Sandman.
	
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
	
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
	
						DOC
			It's a real privilege, Sandman.

						LOGAN
			Thanks.
					(slightest beat)
			I thought you'd be older. I ex-
			pected a Red.

						DOC (showing his palm;
					the flower crystal is Red)
			I am.

						LOGAN
			Your own work?

						DOC (with pride)
			And I did it myself right on there.

144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
	
						DOC
			I designed it myself.
					(slightest beat)
			What'll it be ...a face job or
			a full-body job?

						LOGAN 
			Just the face.

						DOC 
			Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
			You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

						DOC 
			Holly works here because she gets a 
			lift out of watching the Table...
					(smiles)
			and other things. I'll be back in a 
			minute.

						HOLLY
			He's going to sterilize himself.

						LOGAN  
			Do I have to undress?

						HOLLY 
			Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

						DOC	
			You shouldn't have brought him here.	

						JESSICA;
			I didn't bring him -- what's
			the difference. He's blinking.
			He wants to run.
		
						DOC
			Run!? He's a Sandman.

						JESSICA
			I tell you he's running. I know.
		
						DOC
			Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
			gone somewhere else.
					(a beat, a shrug)
			All right. He gets a face.
		
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

						HOLLY
					(leaning - close to 
					Logan) 
			I like dark hair. Have him give you 
			dark hair.

						DOC'S VOICE		
			All set?			
			
						HOLLY
			Um huh. Would you take a picture
			of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
			his face to somebody else.

						DOC 
			Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

						DOC
			Do you have anything special in mind?

						LOGAN
			I don't care...Just get it over
			with.

						DOC (smiling) 
			Hurry...hurry...hurry.

						HOLLY (whispering) 
			Dark hair.

						LOGAN
			Holly'd like dark hair.
			
						DOC
			Holly'd like a lot of things.
					(studying Logan's face)
			We can start by narrowing the
			cheekbones.
			
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.		
					
						DOC 
					(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello
					(listening)
			Yes
					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

						DOC
			Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

						DOC
			With this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in
			one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

						DOC 
			But here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 	

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3		BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

						DOC			
			Perfect depth adjustment on this			
			one, Sandman. The beam will cut	
			through that uniform and just
			exactly through the skin beneath--
			absolute precision. Watch now
	
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

						DOC
			Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
			Sandman, but otherwise it does
			everything, doesn't it? Just
			imagine what would happen to you
			if the healing stopped functioning.
		
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
		
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

						HOLLY
			No! You're scrambling the table.
			He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
	
						DOC
			Damn right! It was a trap. They
			know!
	
						LOGAN
			No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY	

Watching intently as:
	
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
	
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156		CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.	

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

						LOGAN (out-of-breath)
			What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3	LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI 	OUT

163		FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

						FRANCIS (frowning)
			What's going on, Logan?!

						LOGAN
			It has nothing to do with you.

						FRANCIS 
					(choking but still loyal)
			What are you talking about?! I saw you 
			let a Runner go? 
					(up a notch)
			I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166 		OUT

166X1		FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167		ARCADE TRACKING	

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
	
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

						JESSICA
			Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173 		OUT

174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
	
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

						WANTON
			I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON	

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183		FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184		WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
			
185		FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1 	OUT

186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY	

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

						LOGAN
			Are you taking me to them?

						JESSICA 
			Yes.
					(beat)
			I don't know what else to do -- with
			him following us.
					(she hesitates) 
			Why do you keep running from your--

						LOGAN
			Because he's my friend -
					(a beat) 
			and I don't want to be killed by him - 
			or anyone.

						JESSICA 
			He's good, isn't he?

						LOGAN
			Will he find us and kill us?
			Yes...or one of the others.
					(a beat) 
			You know there's only one place 
			to go now...

						 JESSICA (hopelessly) 
			They won't believe us.

						LOGAN	
					(beat)		
			I'd rather take my chances with
			them...than with Francis.

						JESSICA
			They won¹t listen.
			
						LOGAN (interrupting)
			You think Sandmen will?
					(before she can answer)
			There's no other way for me,

						JESSICA 
			We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

						JESSICA 
			Yes, Logan.
					(turning to him blindly)
			I'm glad they didn't change your
			face.
	
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
	
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187 		OUT
		
187X1	FRANCIS
	
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200 	OUT

200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

						JESSICA (softly) 
			Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
					(they walk) 
			Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
			you'll have to get behind me.

						LOGAN (whispering) 
			How will they know we're coming?

						JESSICA (whispering)	
			They're watching us now. They'll	
			let us in when they're sure.	

200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
			
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

						VOICE (scratchy, 
					filtered) 
			Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
					(he does)
			Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
			your hands over. Palms up. 
					(beat) 
			In a moment a light will shine in your 
			eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
			then you, Sandman. You will have to 
			stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
			Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

						VOICE
			Hold still, Sandman, or die where
			you are.

						2ND VOICE
			Is she the one?
	
						OTHER VOICES (like angry
					stage whispers)
			She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
			Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
			Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204 	OUT

205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE	

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

						LOGAN 
			I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
			I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

						VOICE
			He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

						2ND VOICE
			You don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-

						LOGAN	
			Yes I have.		
					(beat)	
			Now it's my turn. And I want to
			live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206		LOGAN	

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

						HOLLY 
			Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

						VOICE (gentle)
			Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
			The code, please Holly...

						HOLLY (hysteria)	
			They smashed everything and I barely
			got away.
					(beat)
			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.	
			
						HOLLY	
			It's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.

						JESSICA
			No, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!
	
						HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.
			He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
			Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
			Doc and you grabbed me--and the
			machine blew up and I ran...I ran
	
	 					JESSICA
			Holly. Holly! Please...The other
			Sandman. Remember the one who came
			after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately) 
			...and he was hunting the first one, 
			this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
			one was running, the other one was 
			hunting him...

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.
					(to Logan) 
			He was after you. I remember. You're 
			running!

207-208 	OUT

208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

						LOGAN 
			May we move?

A long beat. Then--

						VOICE
			I saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

						VOICE 
			You two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

						LOGAN
			I don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.

						VOICE 
			It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.

						LOGAN
			I Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

						VOICE 
			Someone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.

						LOGAN 
					(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

						JESSICA
			Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

						VOICE1
			Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
			With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
			
						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?

						LOGAN
			Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
			
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
			
						LOGAN
			Come on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
			
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209 		OUT

209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2	LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210		ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
	
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

						FRANCIS 
					(believing the	
					blinking crystal is Jessica's)	
			Logan. I know you're in here. 
 			What've you done...gone crazy over a 
			Runner?
					(whispering) 
			Nobody knows except me. You know I 
			won't say anything. I should have 
			turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
			her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
			like you're part of the group that 
			hit this nest.
					(pleading) 
			Logan...you're a Sandman!
					(slightest beat)
			Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
	
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
	
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

						VOICE	
			Runner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.

214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
	
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

						LOGAN 
			Wait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

						JESSICA
			There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE	

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1	WITH FRANCIS	

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
	
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS	

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

						JESSICA
			How do we know this is the right
			way?

						LOGAN
			It's the only way.
			
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

						JESSICA
			What do you suppose this was...?

						LOGAN
			Some kind of breeding pens...I
			suppose...They say people used
			to breed animal s, fish, anything
					(at her disbelieving look)
			To eat, of course.
			
						JESSICA
			Ycch.
					(shudders)
			To kill things and then eat them.
			It must have been a savage world.
			
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
			
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT	

moving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

						JESSICA
			It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226		LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227		FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
		
They turn and run as they HEAR:
	
						FRANCIS (distorted;
					echo; etcetera)
			LOGAN N N N.
		
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232		INT. - THE SHAFT 	

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
		
Logan slumps to the floor.

233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.

						LOGAN	
			It's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

						JESSICA 
			Wait.

He halts.

						JESSICA (cont'd)	
			I don't know what's going to happen	
			to us Logan but --	
					(a beat)
			Are you glad you didn't kill him?

						LOGAN 
			It doesn't make any difference anymore.

						JESSICA 
			You're really one of us now, aren't you?

						LOGAN 
			You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
					(Jessica nods)
			Why did you stay with me?

						JESSICA (feelingly) 
			I wanted to...
				(Logan puts his arms
				around her) 
			...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

						LOGAN
			I had to. I did kill...for the
			first time in my life I killed.

						JESSICA 
			Because you felt like a Runner, 
			didn't you.

						LOGAN 
			I guess so...I know I felt something 
			I never felt before...and I didn't 
			like it...not a bit.
					(after another long beat) 
			I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
			better be worth it. That's the last 
			place for me to live now.

						JESSICA 
			For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236 	OUT
		
236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2	ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
		
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

						VOICE
			Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238	OUT

239		FULL ANGLE - BOX	

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

						BOX		
			Are you too startled? Am I too	
			removed from your ken?	
					(slightest beat)
			I'm neither machine nor man...but
			a perfect fusion of the two...and
			better than either.
					(with great pride)
			No human sculptor could match this
			greatness...don't you agree?

						LOGAN
			All right - what are you?
	
						BOX (laughs)
			Your turn.
	
						JESSICA
			It's incredibly beautiful.

						BOX	
			Ah, but wait for the winds. Then	
			my birds sing. My walrus breathes.	
			My palace chimes and bells. And the
			deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
			Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

						LOGAN (after a beat)
			We're hungry	do you have anything
			to eat?
	
						BOX
			Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

						JESSICA (quietly)
			We're human and we're hungry.

						BOX (still laughing) 
			I know...I know.

						LOGAN
			This place is a link to Sanctuary,
			isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

						LOGAN (angrily) 
			How do you think we got here??!!

						BOX
			You walked in. I saw you. Don't
			you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

						LOGAN (beginning 
					again; quietly) 
			Where do you think we came from?

						BOX 
			From? From? From?

						LOGAN	
			We were sent here and you know it.
			Others have been sent here. Where
			are they? Hiding?
	
Box looks around the cavern:
	
						BOX (mischievously)
			Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

						LOGAN
			Where do we go?!	
					(up a notch)			
			Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

						BOX 
			Is that the wind?
					(smiling)
			Not yet...
					(slightest beat) 
			You must hear my birds sing.

						LOGAN 
			You know about Sanctuary! I know 
			you do! You have to help us! You 
			don't have a choice! It isn't your 
			decision!! Tell us.

						BOX
			Never a pair. I have never had a
			pair.

						LOGAN
			Where do you send them?

						BOX
			You're a beautiful pair.

						JESSICA 
			Please.

						BOX 
			I've never seen humans whom I thought 
			worthy of being here...
					(a beat) 
			I'd like to sculpt you.
					(looking around) 
			Where would I put you?
					(smiling) 
			I know...you'd be the base of the 
			column. You'd hold up my world!

						LOGAN (exasperated) 
			Answer the question!

						BOX 
			Do you know how long all this will 
			last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
			thousand years...but thirty thousand 
			thousand years...and you'll be part 
			of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
			you'll be here...the two of you... 
			eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

						LOGAN (to Jessica)	
			There must be somebody else up here.	
			I can't believe that he's--	

						BOX (interrupting;
					his voice tone changing;
					very lucid)
			Let me sculpt you and I will show
			you where the others have gone.
	
						LOGAN
			That's better.
					(slightest beat)
			How do you want us?

						BOX
			Nude. Imagine, a pair.

						LOGAN (starting to 
					take off his clothes; 
					as Jessica hesitates, 
					Logan smiles)
			It'll be all right...

240-241	JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

						BOX
			Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

						LOGAN
			How do you want us?

						BOX (beat)
			Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

						BOX
			Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

						BOX'S VOICE	
			Superb!	

242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243		LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245	OUT

246		CLOSE - ON BOX

						BOX (stepping back) 
			Done...behold...!

247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

						BOX'S VOICE
			Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

						JESSICA (squeezing	
					Logan's hand)	
			It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

						LOGAN
			All right. Now you keep your
			bargain.

						BOX (rapt by his
					work) 
			Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
			the birds sing over you!

						LOGAN (only interested
					in getting out)
			We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250		INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN	
		IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
	
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

						LOGAN (stupefied) 
			How did they get in here?

						BOX
			Regular storage procedure...the
			same as the other food... The
			other food stopped coming and they
			started.
	
						LOGAN
			What other food?

						BOX
			Fish and plankton, sea greens and
			protein from the sea.
					(pointing to the frosted
					ice wall)
			It's all here - ready - fresh as
			harvest day. Fish and plankton,			
			sea greens and protein from the
			sea...And then it stopped coming
			and they (gesture) came instead.
			So I store them here. I'm ready.
			And you're ready. It's my Job -
			protein, plankton, grass from the
			sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

						LOGAN	
			Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll	
			destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

						BOX (calmly)
			Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
			you facing one another.
		
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

						BOX (advancing)
			Resign yourself.

255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

						BOX (chilling tone) 
			I make such a small, quick incision ...
			you can hardly feel it.

261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
	
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

						BOX (looking up; 
					screaming) 
			No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

						BOX (still screaming)	
			All my work!' All my work!!	

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270	OUT
			
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2	LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE	
		
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
			
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE	
	
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
			
270x5	FULL SHOT	

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6	BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7	ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8	BOX
	
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
	
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10	FULL SHOT	
	
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272	OUT

273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN	

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

						JESSICA 		
			Is there something on fire!!	 

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
			
						LOGAN
			It seems to be moving away.
			Come on...

274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS	

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

						JESSICA (frightened) 
			What's that?

						LOGAN 
			It feels like breath. It makes 
			everything move. Your hair is moving.

						JESSICA (smiling) 
			And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

						LOGAN
			Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276	OUT

276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1	
OUT

288		EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

						JESSICA (starting to panic)
			I hate outside! I hate it!

						LOGAN (holding her; 
					comforting tone)
			We'll be all right...
					(a beat)
			We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
		
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
		
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

						JESSICA
			Don't!

						LOGAN
			Sooner or later, we'll have to try
			something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

						LOGAN
			They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

						JESSICA
			It's getting dark and cold.	
			I'm tired.		

						LOGAN 
			Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
			eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT	

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

						JESSICA 
			Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA
			Do you think everything's going to
			turn to ice?

						LOGAN
 			I doubt it.
	
						JESSICA
			Don't ever let go.

						LOGAN
			I won't.
	
After a long beat:

						LOGAN
			It all seemed to make sense until
			Box.

						JESSICA
			Do you think he was telling the
			Truth?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA (trying to 
					convince herself) 
			Maybe we're the first ones to get 
			through... 
					(hopeful tone) 
			Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
			another protected place. It couldn't 
			be outside.

						LOGAN (grunts) 
			How would anyone know? Even if we find 
			it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

						LOGAN
			You're right...it must be near
			now. We'll find it.

						JESSICA (yawning;		
					closing her eyes; resting	
					on his shoulder)	
			Thirty thousand years didn't last
			very long, did they?
	
288X2	EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
	
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3	EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4	EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5	EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

						JESSICA
			Logan!!!Look!!
					(Logan turns around)
			No...your palm...look!!! 	

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			What does it mean?
	
						LOGAN (trying to
					assimilate its meaning
					himself)
			The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

						JESSICA (with laughter)
			You can have any woman in the city.
			What do you really want?

						LOGAN (straight)
			You know, Jessica.

						JESSICA. (a beat)
			...But I still have the choice...?

						LOGAN
			Of course.

						JESSICA
			Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...

						LOGAN 
			I have never seen a face like that

			age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.

						JESSICA (beat) 
			Yes, do you think that's why he looks

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

						LOGAN
			They all have names and numbers

						JESSICA
			"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
			What can all that mean?
		
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
		
						JESSICA
			Francis?
		
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
		
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)

301X24	INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE
		HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS	

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

						JESSICA (frowning; 
					whispering)
			Look at his face...and his hair... 
					(grimacing)
			Is that what it is to grow old?

						LOGAN (still stunned)
			It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

						LOGAN
			How old are you?		

						MAN
			As old as I am I suppose...who
			knows ?

						LOGAN 
			Your hair is white.

						MAN		
			It wasn't always. I remember when		
			it wasn't. But it wasn't your	
			color either.
					(looking at Jessica) 
			...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

						JESSICA
			Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

						MAN 
			Oh, no...

						JESSICA 
			Could I touch them?

						MAN
			Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

						JESSICA 
			What's your name?

						MAN
			I've forgotten. It's been so
			long since I've used it.
	
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
	
						MAN
			But all of my cats have names.
	
						LOGAN
			Is that what they're called--
			cats?

						OLD MAN
			Yes, cats, of course. What else
			could they be? Cats. Of course
			each one has his own name too.
	
						JESSICA
			But there are so many of them.
			Do you know each one separately.
		
						OLD MAN
			Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
			they all have three.
					(reciting)
			"The naming of cats is a difficult
			matter. It isn't just one of your
			holiday games. You may think at	
			first I'm mad as a hatter when I	
			tell you a cat must have THREE
			DIFFERENT NAMES."
					(a beat)
			An ordinary name and a fancy name.
			That's two. Do you want to guess
			what the third one is?
		
Logan and Jessica are silent.

						OLD MAN (reciting again)	
			"But above and beyond there's	
			still one name left over,	
			And that is the name that you
			never will guess;
			The name that no human research
			can discover -- -
			But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
			will never confess."
					(reaching down and
					stroking another cat)
			Will you, my pet?
		
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

						OLD MAN (reciting)
			"Why did you go little fourpaws?
			You forgot to shut your big eyes."
					(the man closes his
					eyes for a moment; then:)
			"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
		
As the man opens his eyes:
	
						LOGAN
			How long have you been living
			here?
	
						OLD MAN
			For as long as I can remember.
	
						LOGAN
			What kind of place is this?
	
						OLD MAN
			Just a place, I suppose...who
			knows?

The man looks puzzled.

						LOGAN
			How did you get here?

						OLD MAN
			I have always been here...

						LOGAN			
			Are there any other humans?	
	
						OLD MAN
			Gracious...no.

						LOGAN 
			Have any other people ever passed 
			through?

The man shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN 
			But there may be a few around somewhere.

						LOGAN 
			What makes you think so?

						OLD MAN 
			My parents thought so. Mother and 
			Father. You know?

						LOGAN (astonished) 
			Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
			and father?

The man nods.

						JESSICA 
			And...and how were you grown? Inside
			your mother?

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						JESSICA 
			Are you sure?

						OLD MAN 
			Mother and Father said so... you know?

						LOGAN 
			Where are they?

						OLD MAN
			Dead...they're dead...and buried.

						JESSICA (not knowing
					what it is)
			Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302		CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303		CLOSE ON THE MAN

						OLD MAN (pleased; 
					reciting) 
			"Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
			His name, as I ought to have told 
			you before, Is really Asparagus. 
			That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
			that we usually call him just Gus."

306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						OLD MAN
			May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
		
						OLD MAN
			They're beautiful. May I have
			one too please?
		
						LOGAN
			No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
			
						OLD MAN (offended)
			It isn't fair. I'll give you one
			of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
			cat.
					(reciting)
			"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
			Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
			They like to practice their airs and graces
			And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


						LOGAN	
			I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
			give you.	
		
As the man continues to look petulant:

						JESSICA (simply; 
					sincerely)
			That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

						JESSICA
			Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
	
						OLD MAN
			What kind of jewel is this?

						JESSICA
			I don't know.
	
						OLD MAN
			You're both full of secrets like
			Macavity.	
					(looking at the ring)
			Did you steal this?
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						OLD MAN 
					(reciting)
			"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
			one like Macavity,
			There never was a cat of such
			deceitfulness and suavity."
	
						LOGAN
			What's beyond this place - do you
			know?
	
						OLD MAN
			No, no, no
		
						LOGAN
			Did your Mother or Father ever
			mention another place?
	
						OLD MAN
			Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

						LOGAN	
			May we stay here for a while?	
			We'd like to rest.	

						OLD MAN
			Of course you can stay. This
			belongs to the people.

						JESSICA
			What belongs to the people?

						OLD MAN
			All this. All of it.
		
						JESSICA
			What people?
			
						OLD MAN
			I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

						OLD MAN
			I'll be right back.
					(stopping)
			Oh, yes...about the cats...
			one rule is true:
					(reciting)
			"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
			
The man smiles and leaves.
		
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			How curious people used to be --
			All these books...

Silence...until:

						LOGAN
			That sweet madman -- how could he
			Come to exist?
	
						JESSICA	
			He had a mother and father --	
			and he knew them.	

						LOGAN
			One in a million, I suppose

						LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
					smiling) 
			...Who knows? 

						JESSICA (after a beat) 
			We're going on, aren't we?

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

						JESSICA 
			There's a Sanctuary...there is!

						LOGAN
			You want there to be one...that
			Doesn't...

						JESSICA (interrupting; 
					urgent tone) 
			There has to be! I know it exists! It 
			has to!!

						LOGAN (gently) 
			No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
			many want it to exist...so many who 
			don't want to die...want it so much 
			that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
			"real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
			existed. Just the hope.

						JESSICA (becoming	
					hysterical)
			You're wrong!! It has to be!!
			It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

						OLD MAN	
			Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

						OLD MAN (gesturing) 
			There are larger pictures of other 
			people over there. I don't know who 
			they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308 		OUT

308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

						LOGAN 
			That's the same fellow who's outside. 
			If he was so important - why isn't he 
			first?

The old man shakes his head.

309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

						FRANCIS 
			What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

						FRANCIS	
			Why? Why you?	
					(grabbing her)	
			Do you know you ruined him? Do
			you know that? Can you tell me
			why? Why you?
					(a beat)
			And now you've killed him, you
			know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

						JESSICA (screaming) 
			Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310 		OUT

310x1	LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311		INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

						FRANCIS' VOICE 
			Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

						OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
			How nice...more company...

						FRANCIS (emotional; 
					disjointed thoughts) 
			We had such good times together... 
			I let you go! 
					(frenzied) 
			You didn't terminate a Runner and 
			I let you go!!
					(a beat)
			She did this to us! How could you
			let her?! An ordinary available??!!
					(with this he flings
					Jessica down and away.
					She lies there...stunned)
			And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
					(a tear in his eye)
			....Why didn't you chink about them?!
					(up a notch)
			There's over two hundred years of
			Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
			and now you'll spill it for a
			stinking Runner!!

312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

						LOGAN 
			Look at your palm, Francis.... 
			look! It's clear. Clear!

313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

						FRANCIS 
			Why did you do that??!!

						LOGAN
			I didn't do anything, Francis!
			They've made us believe that....

						FRANCIS (interrupting; 
					wild) 
			Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

						FRANCIS (delirious)	
			That was the right shot--Look out	
			there, he's trying to break free		
			Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

						FRANCIS 
			Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
	
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...he died...

333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

						OLD MAN
			We¹ll have to bury him.

						JESSICA
			What¹s that?

						OLD MAN
			They¹re put into the ground so
			they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

						OLD MAN
			I¹ll make the arrangements.

						JESSICA (softly)
			At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN
			Are you ready to put him in?
	
						LOGAN
			Not yet.

						OLD MAN
			All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

335-338	OUT

						OLD MAN'S VOICE 
			"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY

As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.

Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.

339X2	JESSICA

quietly watching:

DISSOLVE TO:
		
339X3	INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

						OLD MAN
			Of course...that's settled then.
			But just you remember your promise...

						JESSICA 
			We'll remember. But that's a long time 
			off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

						LOGAN 
			What are we promising him? What can we 
			possibly give him?

						JESSICA 
			He asked if we would bury him when his 
			time comes.

						 LOGAN (beat)
			We can't. We're going back.

						JESSICA 
			To what?

						LOGAN		
			I'm going to try and tell people what 
			we've seen and--

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			You're lying! You'll never have the 
			chance to tell anybody anything! 
			You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

						LOGAN 
			Do you expect me to let things go on 
			without trying to change them?!

						JESSICA 
			Things won't change...you know that! 
			We can live here together, Logan...
			have a life as long as his... together!

						LOGAN (showing his palm) 
			Things change!

						JESSICA
			You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
			Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
			Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

						LOGAN (softly) 
			Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
					(as she quiets down)
			The Lifeclocks made me kill
			Francis. They make people die or
			be killed every day. If I didn't
			try and destroy that...I couldn't
			live here or anywhere. Do you
			understand?

						JESSICA
			I want to be alive and with you,
			that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

						LOGAN 
			I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

						LOGAN 
			We're leaving.

						 OLD MAN		
			What a pity. I was hoping you'd	
			be here to bury me.	

						JESSICA 
			Come with us.

						OLD MAN 
			Where are you going?

						LOGAN 
			To a city with thousands and thousands 
			of people.

						OLD MAN 
			Alive?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN 
			Thousands and thousands...as many as 
			my cats?

						LOGAN 
			More...many more.

						OLD MAN 
			And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN
			Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
			a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

						OLD MAN (mumbling) 
			Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349	OUT

350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.	

351-361 	OUT

361X1	EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

						OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
			Never see the sun or the moon... 
			I hope we get there soon...

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE	

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						OLD MAN (weary but
					enthusiastic)
			Is that really it? It doesn't
			seem very far. Will we be there
			soon?

						LOGAN
			I promise. We '11 go on as soon
			as it's light.

						JESSICA (gently, 
					turning O.M. away) 
			But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
			the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

						OLD MAN 
			That's better than gold when it's cold.

						LOGAN		
			Thank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...

						OLD MAN
			My father was the husband and my
			mother was the wife. "Beloved" is	
			a word they used - to stay together.

						LOGAN 
			Stay? They lived together all their years?

						OLD MAN 
			Oh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading; 
					moved) 
			³Beloved son²... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that 
			feeling of love... They would live and 
			raise children together and be remembered. 
					(another beat) 
			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
			be that way?

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)

						JESSICA		
			And Sanctuary?		

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

						JESSICA (whispering)
			Beloved husband...

						LOGAN (kissing her)
			Beloved wife...

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the

363 		OUT

364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365		WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

						JESSICA
			What does that water do?

						LOGAN
			It's part of the hydrogalvanic
			system. The ocean tides are changed
			into energy somehow.

						JESSICA
			Is it inside the city?

						LOGAN
			Of course.
					(a beat)
			I don't know where...
					(frowning)
			I Just took them for granted. 
					(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
			It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
		
						LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this
			way. I don't think you can make it.

						OLD MAN (sadly)
			Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
			all those people.

						LOGAN
			I'm sorry.

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						LOGAN
			Can you make it back?

						OLD MAN
			Oh my...I'll try. 

						JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
			Goodbye.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367		THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl 	OUT

369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

						LOGAN'S VOICE
			No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2	LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

						LOGAN 
			You don't have to die!! No one has 
			to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
			to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
			renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
			longer and grow old... I've seen it.
			She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

						LOGAN (holding up
					his palm)
			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
	
		PROBABILITY	
				
blinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372 		OUT

372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

373-378 	OUT

378X1-
378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
		AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS
					(Logan's voice)
			A Jewelry store. 

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.						A SECOND HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			A creature called Box - all frozen, 
			all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.		
			
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.	

G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
					(Logan's Voice)
			No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.						A FIFTH HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			An old man without a crystal...But
			there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P. 						A SIXTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

						LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
					 from all of them)
			There is no Sanctuary. There is
			no Sanctuary.

The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.	 

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410 	OUT

410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2	SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
	
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4	THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN	

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6	SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7	INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9	INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11	GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12	CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13	GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14	ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22	EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING 

INTERCUT with above:

410X23	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.

410X24	LOGAN AND JESSICA
		
Running past Power Center.

411	EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
	
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE 
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.








FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES

1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT											

The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY	

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS

As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER	

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
 
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR	

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

7 		OUT

8		WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR						

Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

10		WITH THE RUNNER			

Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)								

Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

12		P.O.V.		

The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

13		THE SANDMAN			

Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE			

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

15		THE SANDMAN		

Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)	

Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

(TITLES END)

17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)		

Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR		

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

19		OUT

19X1		LOGAN 			

Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

						LOGAN
			Wake up...come on, Logan-6.

19X2		FRANCIS

entering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?
	
						LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!
	
Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

						FRANCIS               
			You should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!

						FRANCIS    
			Maybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

						FRANCIS 
			Okay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM.

						LOGAN 
			Hey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
 
						LOGAN
			Now you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

						VOICE 
			Break-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.

						LOGAN 
			Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.

						VOICE
			Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

						VOICE
			Sleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

						FRANCIS
			You need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.
 
						LOGAN 
			Has anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?

						FRANCIS 
					(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?

						LOGAN 
			just wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
 
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

						LOGAN 
			but you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."

						FRANCIS 
			Well, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?
 

						LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.

						FRANCIS
			Well the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
 
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

						MAN
			Well? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -

						MAN 
			Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?

						WOMAN 
			Too little.

						MAN 
			Too little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

						LOGAN
			Did you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

						FRANCIS 
			I don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

						FRANCIS
			and that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

						FRANCIS 
			You're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It¹s  my Love-Shop turn.

						WOMAN
			That's all right. Happy turn.

						2ND WOMAN
			You'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.

						2ND WOMAN 
			I feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.

						WOMAN
			Um-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
 
						FRANCIS
			I guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

						FRANCIS
			You missed something special.

						LOGAN
			Well...you can't have them all.

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS 
					(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

						FRANCIS 
			The damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
 
30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
	
						LOGAN 
			You should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.
	
						FRANCIS
			Damn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .
	
						LOGAN
			Want me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anyway
		
Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

34.		ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

						LOGAN 
			Now there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.
	
						FRANCIS 
			Only a few? You're just not trying.

35-36	    OUT

37		PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

38 		OUT

38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

39		THE CROWD	

Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

40		LASTDAY GROUP	

Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

41		CROWD

Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

42		CAROUSEL

As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

43		CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

44		CAROUSEL

Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

45		LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest.

46		CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
		
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN		

At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWD	

Hysterical...starting to chant...

						CROWD 
			Renew!

The man continues to strain:

						CROWD 
			Renew!

51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

Almost a blur...but still straining:
		
						CROWD'S CHANT
			Renew!

52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

						LOGAN AND FRANCIS
					(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!

53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN		

The blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...

						CROWD'S CHANT 
			Re...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.

54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL	

Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERS		

Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

56 		OUT

57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS			

As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

			MAN: RELIVE STORE 14		
			
					 	LOGAN 
					(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.
		
Francis stands.
		
						LOGAN
			Who invited you?

						FRANCIS
			I'm in my party mood.
		
Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN 		

running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.	

(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)

E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

59X12-
63X1		    OUT

63X2		WITH LOGAN	

As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER			

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
	
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:

The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

63X6		LOGAN

Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

						LOGAN
			Runner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.
	
						FRANCIS
			Yes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
	
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY	

The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.	
					
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
		
63X11		2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
			
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
			
63X13		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

						FRANCIS 
			...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

						FRANCIS 
					(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.
	
63X15		LOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.

Crazy, man.

63X17		BACK TO LOGAN	

Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
		
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS	

The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

63X19		LOGAN		
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS		

As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE	

Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
		
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

64		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

						LOGAN
			What's wrong, Available?

						JESSICA 
					(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

						LOGAN
			Please . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.

						JESSICA 
			No. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.

						LOGAN 
			You prefer women?

						JESSICA 
			No.

						LOGAN
			Well then...?

						JESSICA
			Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.

						LOGAN 
			Sad? What made you sad?
	
						JESSICA 		
			A friend of mine went on Carousel		
			tonight. Now he's gone.	
		
						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			Yes...probably he was renewed?

						JESSICA 
					(flatly)
			He was killed

						LOGAN
			Killed? Why do you use that word?

						JESSICA
			Isn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.

						LOGAN
			I never 'killed' anybody in my life.
			Sandmen terminate  Runners
					(a beat)
			Who brought you?

						JESSICA 
			Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself
			on the circuit.

						LOGAN
			You felt sad. What's your name?

						JESSICA
			Jessica.

						LOGAN 
					(matter-of-fact)
			You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						LOGAN
			Later.

						JESSICA
			No.	

						LOGAN
			But you put yourself on the circuit!

						JESSICA
			I thought I had to do something.
		
						LOGAN			
			And?				

						JESSICA
			I changed my mind

						LOGAN
			And now?
	
						JESSICA
			Curious.

						LOGAN
			About what?
							
						JESSICA
			How a Sandman lives.

Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.

						LOGAN
			Let's have sex.
					(as Jessica shakes her head)
			I thought you were curious.
						
						JESSICA
			Not about that.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat)
			I'm listening.

						JESSICA
			I'm afraid to tell you.

						LOGAN 
					(smiling)
			I'm not armed.
					(a beat)
			Well?

						JESSICA
			Why is it wrong to run?				

						LOGAN
			You shouldn't even think such things...
					(smiles)
			And you picked a strange person to
			say them to - 
		
						JESSICA
			I suppose. But what if you want
			to live?

						LOGAN
			So? Do what everyone does. Try
			like hell for renewal.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

						LOGAN
			When this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...
			you have the same chance as everyone 
			else...Carrousel.

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

						LOGAN 		(playfully) 
			But if you're one of the misfits... 
			that's where I come in.

						JESSICA (somewhat
					frightened)
			I didn't say that I would run...
			I Just...

						LOGAN (interrupting;
					turning over her palm)
			Are you a 5 or a 6?
					(we see a green crystal)

						JESSICA
			Six. I go red next year.

						LOGAN
			You're years away . . . I don't know
			why you're thinking of these things,
			much less talking about them.
					(offering Jessica the gun) 
			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

						LOGAN
			What Quad do you live in?

						JESSICA 
			K.

						LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.

						LOGAN 	
			It's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.

						LOGAN
			It's nice co know you can do that,
			too.
	
Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
	
						FRANCIS
			These are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?
	
At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

						LOGAN
			What happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.

						LOGAN
			How come?

						SANDMAN
			Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. 
					(as they stare)
			One of them cut me bad... 
					(extends his arm and moves 
					a finger from his shoulder to 
					his wrist)
			all the way down.
					
						FRANCIS
					(with anger)	
			CUBS!	
		
						SANDMAN (shrug)
			On my way to the New You for repairs.

						LOGAN 
			Get yourself a new face while you're 
			at it They know you now.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.

64AX1-
64BX1	    OUT
		
64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)

As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.
		
						LOGAN
			I just might look in on New You 483
			myself.

						FRANCIS 
			You? Why? You're already beautiful.

						LOGAN 
			No -- it's that last Runner -- someone 
			in 483 was trying to help him.

64X2		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM

As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?
	
					FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last night
		
The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

65-68	OUT

69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
 	  
Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.	
			
Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
	|	
			IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
	
			CLEAR
			FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN.

						FRANCIS
			See you in the hydrotoner!
		
Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

		PROBABILITY

blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
	
		APPROACH

We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
		
Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

		IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

		OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOM 
		PATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKED 
		WITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY. 
		PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED. 
		QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?

						LOGAN
			Negative. Question: What is it?
	
Words on SCREEN now read:

		PREMILLENNIAL SYMBOL.
		NAME: ANKH. QUESTION:
		IDENTIFY CONCEPT SANCTUARY?

						LOGAN
			Negative.

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY: CODE WORD PREMILL-
		ENNIAL RELIGIONS DENOTING 
		PLACE OF IMMUNITY.

						LOGAN
			I don't understand?

Words on SCREEN now read:

		SANCTUARY NOW MATHEMATICALLY 
		RELATED TO UNACCOUNTED 
		CITIZENS NUMBERING 1056.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:

Word on SCREEN now reads:	

		HOLD
	
It disappears and words on SCREEN now read:

		OBJECT ANKH ASSOCIATED 
		WITH UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS 1056. 
		CONCLUSION SANCTUARY EXISTENT.... 
		RUNNER GOAL.

						LOGAN 
			1056 unaccounted for?!

Word on SCREEN reads:

		CORRECT

						LOGAN
			Impossible!
					(Rising tone) 
			Question: Maybe they weren't all Runners. 
			Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal 
			on Carousel.

Words on SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE...UNACCOUNTED
		CITIZENS 1056...

						LOGAN 
			Question: None of them reached renewal?

Word on SCREEN reads:

		ZERO

						LOGAN
			But everyone believes that some....

Words on SCREEN read:

		ANSWER: ZERO
		UNACCOUNTED CITIZENS
		NUMBER 1056....LOGAN-
		5 ASSIGNED TO LOCATE
		SANCTUARY AND REPORT....

						LOGAN 
			Question: You mean nobody's ever 
			been renewed?

Words on SCREEN read:

		- - QUESTION ANSWERED....
		ZERO....ECOLOGICAL-NEGATIVE...

As Logan reacts the new words which appear read:	
			
		AUTHORIZATION TO	
		PENETRATE CITY SEALS...

						LOGAN (startled)
			The Seal......
					(Breaks off)
			Question: The Seals? Go outside?!
			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:

		SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...
		FIND		
		DESTROY

						LOGAN
			I will.
	
The words on the SCREEN read:

		ASSIGNMENT SECRET.

						LOGAN
			Question:
					(a beat)
			What if I need help from another
			Sandman?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENT 
		SECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TO 
		RUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.
		
Logan takes a breath.

						LOGAN
			Question: I am six Red...how can
			I pretend to be approaching Lastday?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK--ALTER

						LOGAN
			My Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
			
						LOGAN
			Question:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?
			
The words on the SCREEN read:

		LIFECLOCK-ALTER

						LOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:

		TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

						LOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

		CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAY	

Spectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.
						
						FRANCIS
			What the hell took you so long?

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?

						FRANCIS 
			I think you've been skulling out too 
			much. First Nursery and now stupid 
			questions.

						LOGAN 
			Did you?

						FRANCIS 
			Of course.

						LOGAN 
			Anybody we know?

						FRANCIS 
			Look....why don't you get into the 
			water....you need it....more than I do.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			I'm fine....
					(walking away)
			See you....

						FRANCIS 
			At Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDING	

Logan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.

						LOGAN 
					(into box)
			Location...female Green Six...
			name Jessica...living in Quad K.

71-73 	OUT

73X1		INT. - LOGAN'S APARTMENT	

Logan opens the door to see Jessica. Behind her a young SANDMAN who
has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...

						LOGAN
			She has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

						JESSICA
			You could have called me yourself.

						LOGAN
			But I wasn't sure you'd come.

						JESSICA 
					(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.

						LOGAN
			I couldn't get you out of my mind.

						JESSICA
			I'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?

						LOGAN
			Maybe...sure....

						JESSICA
			Thanks...but I have the choice.
				
						LOGAN	
			Of course.		
						
						JESSICA	
			Then it's still no.

Logan laughs.

						JESSICA	
			You can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?				

						LOGAN
			You know

						JESSICA
			I don't believe you. There has to
			be more.

						LOGAN
			All right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:

						JESSICA
			Why show me?

						LOGAN
			I'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?

						LOGAN
			You know something.
	
						JESSICA
			About running, dying what?

						LOGAN
			Both...running's what I'm interested
			in.

						JESSICA
			I know what everyone knows. Try
			like hell for Renewal. You have
			the same chance everyone else has.

						LOGAN
			It's different now. Help me.

						JESSICA
			How can I?

Logan takes out the ankh.

						JESSICA
			Where did you get that?

						LOGAN
			A Runner gave it to me.

						JESSICA 	
			And then you killed him, right?				

						LOGAN
			I let him go...believe me.

						JESSICA
			I don't..

						LOGAN (a beat)
			Speak to your friends for me, Jessica...
			please...

						JESSICA
			Please? What friends?

						LOGAN 
				(clutching the ankh, looking 
				at Jessica's; then:)
			I don't have much time.

						JESSICA
			I never heard of a Sandman running
			. . . ever. . .

						LOGAN (putting the
			ankh in his pocket;
			dropping the bombshell)
			And I never heard of Sanctuary.

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.

						LOGAN
			What can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..

74-81	OUT 

82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches
the table and sits down.

83		CLOSE ON - LOGAN	

A distance away...watching.

84-85 	OUT	 

86		EXT. - RESTAURANT - FULL ANGLE - THE THREE MEN,
		WOMAN AND JESSICA

Eating without enthusiasm...obviously more interested in their
conversation.

						SECOND MAN 
			He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get 
			old, too.

						FIRST MAN
			But what if he's telling the truth?

						THIRD MAN
			I say no. It's not worth the risk.

						WOMAN
			I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners 
			for a decade. He has no feelings.

						JESSICA
			He was born a Sandman. He had no
			choice.

						WOMAN 
			Neither do we.

87-88 	OUT

88X1		SANDMAN READY ROOM	

Four Sandmen at the consoles. They look up as Francis enters. He 
goes to one of the men who stretches, yawns, gets up.
		
						1ST SANDMAN
			Thanks, Francis.
		
						FRANCIS (taking his
					place at the console)
			Just don't be forever about it like last 
			time.

						1ST SANDMAN
			Ah-h you love it. You're afraid
			you'll miss a really good Run.		

They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.

89 OUT

89X1		EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA

Leaning together talking in an undertone
			
						SECOND MAN (urgently)	
			If he believes you, he'll come.	
			
						JESSICA	
			Why Arcade Station?
			
						SECOND MAN (impatiently)
			Why? It's our only chance--kill him
			and get away in the crowd heading
			for the evening slaughter --
				
						JESSICA
			Right at the station itself?

						MAN
			No - just there - on the first level.
					(beat)
			Don't look for us. We'll see you.

						WOMAN (cutting in)
			You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
					(beat)
			Can you do it? Will you?

Slowly, Jessica nods.

						THIRD MAN
			Tonight?

						JESSICA (stalling)
			Y-yes...if I can find him.

						WOMAN
			I think you can. Don't you?

Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her
eyes, relaxes.

						WOMAN  
			I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard 
			about Sanctuary -- and that makes him 
			dangerous to all of us.

After murmurs of agreement:

						SECOND MAN 
					(staring at Jessica) 
			We're counting on you.

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.

90-92	OUT

93-94 	OUT

94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCIS	

Obviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,
the assignment of a Sandman, the kill.
	
94X1		WITH JESSICA		

Making her way through the strolling crowd, her face thoughtful.

94X2		ANOTHER ANGLE

The man from the restaurant, following.

94X3		GALLERY, SANDMAN RESIDENCE -- JESSICA

Walking slowly up to a door, she hesitates, KNOCKS.

Logan opens the door, reacts.

						LOGAN
			Are you here to help me?
	
						JESSICA
			What do you need?

A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to
him as the door closes.

94X4 	OUT

DISSOLVE TO:
		
94X5		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking along a handsomely landscaped stream. Laughing together,
stopping to admire the beautiful fish (koi).

						JESSICA
			What're you going to do?

						LOGAN
			That's tomorrow.

						JESSICA 
					(turning away slightly)
			I wish I could help you.

						LOGAN 
					(turning her gently back)
			Maybe you'll chink of something...

						JESSICA 
					(hating herself)		
			I wish I knew what you think I know.		

Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each
other anyhow. They commence walking again.
		
94X6		ANOTHER ANGLE		

The followers, ahead now, watching, trying to make up their minds as
to whether Jessica is bringing Logan to the ambush. As they argue,
Logan and Jessica approach.

94X7		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						LOGAN
			If you did know, you'd tell me.
					
						JESSICA
			Of course--

						LOGAN (overriding)
			If you trusted me, you'd know.
				
						JESSICA (evading it)
			We're coming to Arcade.
					(beat)	-
			Shall we Relive together?
	
94X8		CLOSE ANGLE

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

94X9 	OUT

94AX9	READY ROOM	

As 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVEL	

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

94X11	ANOTHER ANGLE

Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

94X12	FEATURING JESSICA	

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

94X13	THE AMBUSHERS	

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.
	
94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

						LOGAN 
			Tell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
	
94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message: 

		RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2
		...LOGAN-5

The Sandman at the console turns and says:		

						1ST SANDMAN
			Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
			why don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others
ad lib interest-- "watch out in there--they can cut you before you
see them" etc.

95-105 	OUT

105X1	ARCADE STATION - THE AMBUSH	

The two watching, muscles taut -- wondering.

106-
106X1	OUT

106X2	ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out
his destination on the car caller.

						LOGAN
			A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.

106X3	MAZE-CAR STATION ARCADE	

						JESSICA
			You're not going, are you?
		
						LOGAN (a beat)
			Why not? Maybe she'll help me.
			You won't. You'd better stay here.

The maze-car arrives and they move to it.
	
						JESSICA (touching his
					arm)
			I'd rather be with you.
	
						LOGAN (knowing she is
					lying through her teeth)
			That's nice.
		
They enter the car which instantly moves off. As it passes, the men
in ambush come forward and read the destination. They ring for
another car which pulls in immediately.

107-
109X1 	OUT
		
109X2	ANOTHER ANGLE	

As the two jam into the maze-car which rockets off in pursuit...

110-
120 		OUT

121		INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT

						LOGAN
			Have you ever been through Cathedral?

Jessica shakes her head.

						LOGAN
			They're like beasts. Wild.
	
						JESSICA		
			Maybe they're angry because they're
			grown in meccano-breeders.

						LOGAN (interrupting,
					grimacing) 
			Instead of what? Nine months inside a 
			woman:
					(ugh) 
			We're all raised the same but most of 
			us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

						JESSICA 
			Some people say children need human 
			mothering.

						LOGAN 
			Insane. Nurseries are better than any 
			mother could be.

						JESSICA 
			I'm only telling you what I've heard...
					(slightest beat) 
			Haven't you ever wondered what your 
			seed-mother was Like...?

						LOGAN 
			Uh-uh.

						JESSICA 
			I have.

						LOGAN 
					(after a beat) 
			When did you begin to question Lastday?

						JESSICA 
			I don't remember exactly...except I was 
			a Green.
					(another beat) 
			What would you like to relive, Logan?

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

						VOICE			
			Attention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.

121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION	

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

						JESSICA
			I've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?
		
There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
		
121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL

Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

						LOGAN 
			Let me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...

						LOGAN
			Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?
	
						LOGAN (as they enter	
					the corridor)	
			The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle 
			there's  no way to catch up. Without the 
			dazzle, they'd just go past us--
					(gesture)
			too fast

						JESSICA
			Muscle? I don't know that one.
	
Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
	
						LOGAN
			It's unauthorized. No good for any-
			one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
			to pieces--speeds everything up to a
			blur--
					(he is amused)
			you can see what happens when some
			flying Cub tries to go through this
			on muscle--splat!
	
Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
	
124		ANOTHER ANGLE	

As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

						JESSICA
			What's your name?

						MARY
			I'm Mary 2.

						JESSICA
			Where do you live, Mary?

						MARY
			Here.

						JESSICA			
			Why aren't you in Nursery?			

						MARY
			I'm very smart.

						JESSICA
			When do you go up?

						MARY
			I never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

						LOGAN
			Runner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.	
		
As Logan whirls:	
		
125X1		ANOTHER ANGLE	

Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

						BILLY 
					(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that 
			one later. Right now I think we've got 
			a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs...mean, filthy.

						A VOICE 
			We're going to have ourselves a time, 
			we are. Right, Billy?!

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

						LOGAN		
			I'm a Sandman!		

						BILLY
			I cut up a Sandman yesterday.  They
			said I'd never get him...but I cut
			him up good, I did.

						LOGAN (firm tone)
			I feel sorry for you, boy!

Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.

						BILLY
			For me? Better feel sorry for your-
			self, Sandman!

						LOGAN
			No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Billy is silent.

						LOGAN 
			Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running 
			out. How long can you last? A year. Six 
			months?
					(he points to the yellow
					flower in Billy's palm)
			What happens when you're sixteen and
			you go green?

						BILLY (lashing out) 
			Nothing will happen! I make the
			rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say!
			Always have! Always will! I got
			Cathedral and I'll never let go!

						LOGAN 
			No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever 
			heard of a cub with a green flower? 
			You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, 
			when you're on green, because they 
			won't let a green stay here.
					(slightest beat) 
			If you try to stay the young ones will 
			gut-rip you apart!

						BILLY
			Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

Logan falls back into a fighting crouch...but before he can strike a
blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

						ANOTHER VOICE	
			Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut	
			his mouth! Let's watch him shake		
			himself to death!!
		
We see the Cubs take out drugpads. They squeeze the pads and inhale
the "Muscle." At once their movements become blurringly rapid. They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead.
			
						A VOICE
			Give him some Muscle!!
		
Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica
			
126		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Watching..terrified.

127		CLOSE ON - LOGAN
	
Being held against the wall by Cubs as:
				
						ANOTHER VOICE
			Shake him to death!!

						A VOICE 
			Kill him!

128		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
	
moving a drugpad against Logan's face.

Logan is holding his breath...desperately trying not to breathe the
"Muscle" directly from the pad into his system.

						BILLY (chilling laugh) 
			He's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

						BILLY		
			We can rush him...we can take 	
			can take him	again, we can!!	

The pack hesitates...stops backing away.

						LOGAN 
					(moving the gun slowly 
					back and forth)
			All right! How many of you want this to 
			be Lastday?!

The pack moves back again...and  disperses, leaving Billy facing
Logan alone.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...come on...you cut
			a Sandman, didn't you?!

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

						LOGAN
			Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			They've got someone else! Why would 
			anybody come here?

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

129		FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN	

frozen for a moment. In f.g. a figure stirs, moves and we see it is
Francis. His weapon is drawn and aimed, but as he watches, he lowers
the barrel and smiles. The is Logan's job.

130		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

watching

131		LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

						WOMAN (nearing
					hysteria)
			There's been a terrible error! My
			Lifeclock must have broken in some way!
					(rising tone)
			I'm nowhere near thirty...look at
			me...I'm twenty-two. I should be
			green! Did you hear me?
					(shouting)
			Green!

						LOGAN (quietly)
			Don't be afraid--	

Before Logan can continue...the Woman...who is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Logan...and starts grappling with him.
	
						WOMAN
			I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!

After Logan pushes her away...and she falls down:

						LOGAN (breathing hard) 
			I'm not going to hurt you.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary? Anything?

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
object...the size of a large marble.

						LOGAN	
			If they find you throw this hard	
			enough to break it. Then hold your	
			breath till you get away...It's
			blind gas.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round
object...she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off.
		
132		EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - 
		MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING

He is shocked, unbelieving.
	
133		CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Stunned and uncertain, Francis aims his gun toward Logan and
Jessica...but he wavers...watching them disappear into the rubble... 

134		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

shivering like a wet dog. He turns toward open window.
		
						FRANCIS (in a firm, cold
					tone)
			Runner!
		
The woman turns, staring insanely. Her mouth opens like a fish as:
Francis FIRES his gun. A moment later, as the burning body topples
to the floor;

134X1		MAZE-CAR PLATFORM - THE MEN	

hearing the unmistakable SCREAMING sound of the kill, they exchange
a look.

135		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

At the flash of FIRE from Francis' gun, they turn.
Logan and Francis' eyes meet. A beat, then Logan grabs Jessica and
pulls her away.

136		FRANCIS 

After a long, long hesitation, takes out his small plastic box and
starts to speak into it:

						FRANCIS (quietly)
			Runner terminated at G.16
			Ready for cleanup at Cathedral
			Quadrant 39.
			
137		ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE 

The Second and Third Men...very close to the maze-car platform...
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform. We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard.

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica.

						SECOND MAN
			I almost believed her.

They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.

138		MED. - ANGLE - FRANCIS 

Gun in hand...running through Cathedral toward the maze-car
platform.

139		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND JESSICA - MOVING SHOT 	

				 		JESSICA
			I'm ashamed. I was bringing you
			to be killed.

						LOGAN
			Where? Sanctuary? Can you take
			me there?	

						JESSICA 
			Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. 
			But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

						LOGAN (a beat) 
			All right. But why? I didn't kill the 
			Runner.

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			Yes, but they won't know that...or care. 
			They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, 
			now...

						LOGAN (wry laugh) 
			That's nothing...there's a Sandman
			behind us, too and there'll be
			more soon. Take me to them.

						JESSICA (torn) 
			I - I can't.

						LOGAN
			Then - why don't you leave me - go
			to them - explain

						JESSICA 
			No. Not that either.

Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:

						LOGAN
			All right. New You 483. I'll find
			out myself.

139X1		INT. - SANDMAN READY ROOM - FRANCIS

Distracted...ignoring the greetings of Sandmen who are monitoring
the city.

139X2		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Walking past the GIANT LIFECLOCKS into the debriefing area.

The scanners begin moving.

Moments later the scanner stops...the word:

		IDENTIFY	

appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into
the groove.

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table.

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:

		REJECT

flashes on and off on the SCREEN.

Sandmen come running into the Area.

						SANDMAN
			What happened?!

Francis hesitates....then....quickly, as if changing his mind,
taking the items off the table:	
		
						FRANCIS
			Can you beat it....I've got the damn
			wrong bag.

						SANDMAN 
			You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 
			Francis.

						FRANCIS (starting out) 
			Yeah....

140		EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:

141		MED. ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind.

142		INT. - NEW YOU #483

The waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and
female...are checking their faces (and bodies).

There are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for
changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop.

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner.

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk.

The receptionist looks at Logan...ignoring Jessica.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Hello, Sandman.

						LOGAN 
			Hello.

						RECEPTIONIST 
			Do you want to see Doc?

Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.

						RECEPTIONIST	
			We don't get many Sandmen. I think
			we've only had one other since I've
			been here.

						LOGAN (brusquely) 
			A Sandman can get as sick of his face 
			as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

						RECEPTIONIST (smiling) 
			I like your face. Would you mind if Doc 
			took a picture? I'd Like him to give 
			your face to somebody else.

						LOGAN
			It's all right with me. Is he here?

						RECEPTIONIST
			My name's Holly...Holly 13. In
			ancient times they said my number
			was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?

						LOGAN
			No - Look, I'm in a hurry.

						HOLLY
			Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			Is this your first time?

Logan and Jessica nod.

						WOMAN CUSTOMER (smiling) 
			This is my third...
					(a beat) 
			... I did it when I turned yellow ...
			and green.
					(showing her palm) 
			I turned red yesterday.

						LOGAN (looking) 
			Beautiful work. This man do them all?

						WOMAN CUSTOMER 
			No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you 
			seen any of his work?

						LOGAN	
			Just one. 
		
						HOLLY
			Doc's ready, Sandman.
	
Logan and Jessica stand. They follow Holly into a large, shining,
stainless steel room where we see:
	
143		MED. ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old, exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica. 
	
						DOC
			It's a real privilege, Sandman.

						LOGAN
			Thanks.
					(slightest beat)
			I thought you'd be older. I ex-
			pected a Red.

						DOC (showing his palm;
					the flower crystal is Red)
			I am.

						LOGAN
			Your own work?

						DOC (with pride)
			And I did it myself right on there.

144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.
	
						DOC
			I designed it myself.
					(slightest beat)
			What'll it be ...a face job or
			a full-body job?

						LOGAN 
			Just the face.

						DOC 
			Fine....Holly will get you ready. 
			You're in good hands, believe me.

Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:

						DOC 
			Holly works here because she gets a 
			lift out of watching the Table...
					(smiles)
			and other things. I'll be back in a 
			minute.

						HOLLY
			He's going to sterilize himself.

						LOGAN  
			Do I have to undress?

						HOLLY 
			Not for your face.

Logan follows Holly to the Table. (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency).

						DOC	
			You shouldn't have brought him here.	

						JESSICA;
			I didn't bring him -- what's
			the difference. He's blinking.
			He wants to run.
		
						DOC
			Run!? He's a Sandman.

						JESSICA
			I tell you he's running. I know.
		
						DOC
			Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd
			gone somewhere else.
					(a beat, a shrug)
			All right. He gets a face.
		
144X1		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY

Logan lies down.

The Table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him.

						HOLLY
					(leaning - close to 
					Logan) 
			I like dark hair. Have him give you 
			dark hair.

						DOC'S VOICE		
			All set?			
			
						HOLLY
			Um huh. Would you take a picture
			of him, Doc? I'd like you to give
			his face to somebody else.

						DOC 
			Why not?

Doc pushes a button...there is a tiny FLASH.

						DOC
			Do you have anything special in mind?

						LOGAN
			I don't care...Just get it over
			with.

						DOC (smiling) 
			Hurry...hurry...hurry.

						HOLLY (whispering) 
			Dark hair.

						LOGAN
			Holly'd like dark hair.
			
						DOC
			Holly'd like a lot of things.
					(studying Logan's face)
			We can start by narrowing the
			cheekbones.
			
Doc presses buttons on the control board. Jessica, who is standing
next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.		
					
						DOC 
					(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello
					(listening)
			Yes
					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

						DOC
			Pay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

						DOC
			With this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in
			one...watch now...

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

						DOC 
			But here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN 	

His face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright
face with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's
happening.

144X3		BACK TO DOC 

who is playing the console as he speaks.

						DOC			
			Perfect depth adjustment on this			
			one, Sandman. The beam will cut	
			through that uniform and just
			exactly through the skin beneath--
			absolute precision. Watch now
	
And the machine does its stuff, slashing through Logan's tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip.

						DOC
			Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms,
			Sandman, but otherwise it does
			everything, doesn't it? Just
			imagine what would happen to you
			if the healing stopped functioning.
		
And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
		
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

						HOLLY
			No! You're scrambling the table.
			He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
	
						DOC
			Damn right! It was a trap. They
			know!
	
						LOGAN
			No - I'm Running!

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY.

Jessica tries to turn the machine off...Doc starts to wrestle with
her as:

145-145X4		INTERCUT: CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN 

Moving.

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower.

Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks.

The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.

146-148		QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY	

Watching intently as:
	
149-150		CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood.  A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly.

151		ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his belly....trying to flatten himself
into the Table.

152-153	CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his face....followed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts.
	
154		CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excited....flushed....as:

155		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downward....and hover three inches
above his neck....and keep lowering ....HUMMING loudly....and one
inadvertently frees Logan's right arm.

156		CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun.

157		CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM.

As dozens of laser beams slash toward Logan....he twists away....and
breaks off....jumping off the Table.

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy.	

In an instant he has knocked Logan's gun away....and as Logan looks
down at it....we see it lying on the floor completely frozen.

Slowly, Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand.

						LOGAN (out-of-breath)
			What I told you is the....

Abruptly, Doc lunges toward Logan...missing him as Logan ducks away.

As Doc turns to attack....Logan smashes his elbows into Doc's chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table.

157X1	CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING, as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces. Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc, but Jessica, recovering,
pulls her down and the two struggle.

157X2	CLOSE ON - DOC

In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.

157X3	LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from
Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance.
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:

158-
162XI 	OUT

163		FRANCIS

Entering...gun in hand.

164		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they face Francis.

165		FULL ANGLE - FRANCIS LOGAN AND JESSICA

						FRANCIS (frowning)
			What's going on, Logan?!

						LOGAN
			It has nothing to do with you.

						FRANCIS 
					(choking but still loyal)
			What are you talking about?! I saw you 
			let a Runner go? 
					(up a notch)
			I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan
jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he
and Jessica run out.

166 		OUT

166X1		FRANCIS

Enraged, finds his gun on the floor and, before rising, gets off a
shot at them as they disappear. Then leaping to his feet, dashing
off in pursuit.

167		ARCADE TRACKING	

Logan and Jessica running through Arcade.
	
167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.

						JESSICA
			Follow me, Logan. Stay close.

As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind...
spots them and follows.

168-
173 		OUT

174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop.

175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA
	
As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and
stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and
laughing:

						WANTON
			I have an empty one, Sandman

Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and
Jessica with it.

176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON	

As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to
pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica.

177-
179		SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off.

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold
and multiform -- everybody doing it.

180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons.

181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other.

183		FRANCIS

Hunting both.

184		WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them.

Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides
shut again.
			
185		FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down
again as the orgy continues.

186-
186X1 	OUT

186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY	

After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in
the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall.

						LOGAN
			Are you taking me to them?

						JESSICA 
			Yes.
					(beat)
			I don't know what else to do -- with
			him following us.
					(she hesitates) 
			Why do you keep running from your--

						LOGAN
			Because he's my friend -
					(a beat) 
			and I don't want to be killed by him - 
			or anyone.

						JESSICA 
			He's good, isn't he?

						LOGAN
			Will he find us and kill us?
			Yes...or one of the others.
					(a beat) 
			You know there's only one place 
			to go now...

						 JESSICA (hopelessly) 
			They won't believe us.

						LOGAN	
					(beat)		
			I'd rather take my chances with
			them...than with Francis.

						JESSICA
			They won¹t listen.
			
						LOGAN (interrupting)
			You think Sandmen will?
					(before she can answer)
			There's no other way for me,

						JESSICA 
			We'll convince them.

They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she
turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off.

						JESSICA 
			Yes, Logan.
					(turning to him blindly)
			I'm glad they didn't change your
			face.
	
Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They
continue down into the darkness.
	
Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard.

187 		OUT
		
187X1	FRANCIS
	
At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows
they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches.

188-200 	OUT

200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA	

They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness.

						JESSICA (softly) 
			Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.
					(they walk) 
			Now to the right. It's narrow here, 
			you'll have to get behind me.

						LOGAN (whispering) 
			How will they know we're coming?

						JESSICA (whispering)	
			They're watching us now. They'll	
			let us in when they're sure.	

200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT)
			
As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a
signal.

200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action.

200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard:

						VOICE (scratchy, 
					filtered) 
			Sandman, put your hands on your head. 
					(he does)
			Clasp your fingers together. Now turn 
			your hands over. Palms up. 
					(beat) 
			In a moment a light will shine in your 
			eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, 
			then you, Sandman. You will have to 
			stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. 
			Do you agree?

Logan nods.

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves
forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends
awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out.

201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan
is unable to draw his gun.

						VOICE
			Hold still, Sandman, or die where
			you are.

						2ND VOICE
			Is she the one?
	
						OTHER VOICES (like angry
					stage whispers)
			She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both.
			Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher.
			Sandman murderer.

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off.

202-204 	OUT

205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE	

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points,
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn.
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches.

						LOGAN 
			I'm a runner. She brought me here because 
			I begged her to help me.

He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.

						VOICE
			He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.

						2ND VOICE
			You don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-

						LOGAN	
			Yes I have.		
					(beat)	
			Now it's my turn. And I want to
			live.

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.

206		LOGAN	

Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.

						HOLLY 
			Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

						VOICE (gentle)
			Holly--Holly. Remember the code.
			The code, please Holly...

						HOLLY (hysteria)	
			They smashed everything and I barely
			got away.
					(beat)
			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.	
			
						HOLLY	
			It's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.

						JESSICA
			No, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!
	
						HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.
			He was in a hurry. Just a face job.
			Dark hair, I said. Then he killed
			Doc and you grabbed me--and the
			machine blew up and I ran...I ran
	
	 					JESSICA
			Holly. Holly! Please...The other
			Sandman. Remember the one who came
			after--

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately) 
			...and he was hunting the first one, 
			this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This 
			one was running, the other one was 
			hunting him...

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.
					(to Logan) 
			He was after you. I remember. You're 
			running!

207-208 	OUT

208X1	ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken, wary.

						LOGAN 
			May we move?

A long beat. Then--

						VOICE
			I saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.

						VOICE 
			You two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

						LOGAN
			I don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.

						VOICE 
			It doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.

						LOGAN
			I Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:

						VOICE 
			Someone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.

						LOGAN 
					(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.

						JESSICA
			Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.

						VOICE1
			Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. 
			With you.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.
			
						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?

						LOGAN
			Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
			
JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.
			
						LOGAN
			Come on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
			
Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.

209 		OUT

209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

As the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

209X2	LOGAN 

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room.

210		ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis, quartering the room like a hound, searching, searching,
stopping as he sees

211		FRANCIS P.O.V.
	
The crystal blinking red, eerie in the darkness.

						FRANCIS 
					(believing the	
					blinking crystal is Jessica's)	
			Logan. I know you're in here. 
 			What've you done...gone crazy over a 
			Runner?
					(whispering) 
			Nobody knows except me. You know I 
			won't say anything. I should have 
			turned you in but I couldn't. Leave 
			her. Come on out with me. It'll look 
			like you're part of the group that 
			hit this nest.
					(pleading) 
			Logan...you're a Sandman!
					(slightest beat)
			Logan...now...now...Logan...

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

212		LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK
	
As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
	
With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE.

						VOICE	
			Runner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.

214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
	
214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.

Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

						LOGAN 
			Wait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

						JESSICA
			There's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE	

now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

217X1	WITH FRANCIS	

As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing
	
128		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS	

A. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.

						JESSICA
			How do we know this is the right
			way?

						LOGAN
			It's the only way.
			
D. POV an alley way full of machinery. Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...
HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.

They speculate.

						JESSICA
			What do you suppose this was...?

						LOGAN
			Some kind of breeding pens...I
			suppose...They say people used
			to breed animal s, fish, anything
					(at her disbelieving look)
			To eat, of course.
			
						JESSICA
			Ycch.
					(shudders)
			To kill things and then eat them.
			It must have been a savage world.
			
Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.
			
G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.

225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT	

moving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.

						JESSICA
			It's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

226		LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

227		FRANCIS

looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

228		LOGAN AND JESSICA	

Logan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient
machinery GROANS.
		
They turn and run as they HEAR:
	
						FRANCIS (distorted;
					echo; etcetera)
			LOGAN N N N.
		
229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHT

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

230		CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

232		INT. - THE SHAFT 	

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.
		
Logan slumps to the floor.

233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.

						LOGAN	
			It's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.

						JESSICA 
			Wait.

He halts.

						JESSICA (cont'd)	
			I don't know what's going to happen	
			to us Logan but --	
					(a beat)
			Are you glad you didn't kill him?

						LOGAN 
			It doesn't make any difference anymore.

						JESSICA 
			You're really one of us now, aren't you?

						LOGAN 
			You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?
					(Jessica nods)
			Why did you stay with me?

						JESSICA (feelingly) 
			I wanted to...
				(Logan puts his arms
				around her) 
			...And you...what made you kill Sandmen?

						LOGAN
			I had to. I did kill...for the
			first time in my life I killed.

						JESSICA 
			Because you felt like a Runner, 
			didn't you.

						LOGAN 
			I guess so...I know I felt something 
			I never felt before...and I didn't 
			like it...not a bit.
					(after another long beat) 
			I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary 
			better be worth it. That's the last 
			place for me to live now.

						JESSICA 
			For us.

Logan mouths "Us"...a strange word...and why not... in the last
minutes he has done strange things.

234-236 	OUT
		
236x1	INT. - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are.

236x2	ANGLE

Before them a vase, dim, ice-shrouded storage area, row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness, their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost. To the
side, a bright light.
		
236x3	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walk toward the light.

236x4	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

We see a huge, high-domed cavern ringed and ornamented with
extraordinary ice sculptures-They are everywhere: Otters, fish, a
tusked walrus---overhead a flight of birds.

236x5	ANOTHER ANGLE

As they look in wonder:

						VOICE
			Overwhelming, isn't it?

Logan and Jessica turn and see:

237-238	OUT

239		FULL ANGLE - BOX	

Box is half-man...half-metal.

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables.
One hand is a cutting tool. His head is half-flesh...half-metal. his
legs are a chrome pedestal.

						BOX		
			Are you too startled? Am I too	
			removed from your ken?	
					(slightest beat)
			I'm neither machine nor man...but
			a perfect fusion of the two...and
			better than either.
					(with great pride)
			No human sculptor could match this
			greatness...don't you agree?

						LOGAN
			All right - what are you?
	
						BOX (laughs)
			Your turn.
	
						JESSICA
			It's incredibly beautiful.

						BOX	
			Ah, but wait for the winds. Then	
			my birds sing. My walrus breathes.	
			My palace chimes and bells. And the
			deep grottoes whisper my name...Box
			Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...

						LOGAN (after a beat)
			We're hungry	do you have anything
			to eat?
	
						BOX
			Anything to eat?

Box starts to laugh...He is roaring with laughter as:

						JESSICA (quietly)
			We're human and we're hungry.

						BOX (still laughing) 
			I know...I know.

						LOGAN
			This place is a link to Sanctuary,
			isn't it?

Box looks totally confused.

						LOGAN (angrily) 
			How do you think we got here??!!

						BOX
			You walked in. I saw you. Don't
			you remember?

Logan contains his anger.

						LOGAN (beginning 
					again; quietly) 
			Where do you think we came from?

						BOX 
			From? From? From?

						LOGAN	
			We were sent here and you know it.
			Others have been sent here. Where
			are they? Hiding?
	
Box looks around the cavern:
	
						BOX (mischievously)
			Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.

						LOGAN
			Where do we go?!	
					(up a notch)			
			Where do we go from here??!!

We hear a NOISE outside.

						BOX 
			Is that the wind?
					(smiling)
			Not yet...
					(slightest beat) 
			You must hear my birds sing.

						LOGAN 
			You know about Sanctuary! I know 
			you do! You have to help us! You 
			don't have a choice! It isn't your 
			decision!! Tell us.

						BOX
			Never a pair. I have never had a
			pair.

						LOGAN
			Where do you send them?

						BOX
			You're a beautiful pair.

						JESSICA 
			Please.

						BOX 
			I've never seen humans whom I thought 
			worthy of being here...
					(a beat) 
			I'd like to sculpt you.
					(looking around) 
			Where would I put you?
					(smiling) 
			I know...you'd be the base of the 
			column. You'd hold up my world!

						LOGAN (exasperated) 
			Answer the question!

						BOX 
			Do you know how long all this will 
			last? Not thirty years...or thirty 
			thousand years...but thirty thousand 
			thousand years...and you'll be part 
			of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And 
			you'll be here...the two of you... 
			eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.

						LOGAN (to Jessica)	
			There must be somebody else up here.	
			I can't believe that he's--	

						BOX (interrupting;
					his voice tone changing;
					very lucid)
			Let me sculpt you and I will show
			you where the others have gone.
	
						LOGAN
			That's better.
					(slightest beat)
			How do you want us?

						BOX
			Nude. Imagine, a pair.

						LOGAN (starting to 
					take off his clothes; 
					as Jessica hesitates, 
					Logan smiles)
			It'll be all right...

240-241	JESSICA 

Undresses.

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs.

						BOX
			Up there.

Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:

						LOGAN
			How do you want us?

						BOX (beat)
			Up there.

Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight.

Logan takes Jessica into his arms.

						BOX
			Enchanting. Is that what humans do?

By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings.

						BOX'S VOICE	
			Superb!	

242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern.

As he works furiously...at Incredible speed:


243		LOGAN AND JESSICA

...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue
to hold one another.

244-245	OUT

246		CLOSE - ON BOX

						BOX (stepping back) 
			Done...behold...!

247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and
passionately.

Their mood is broken by:

						BOX'S VOICE
			Done...Done...Done...

Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:

248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE

Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with
emotion.

249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX

There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture.

						JESSICA (squeezing	
					Logan's hand)	
			It's glorious 

Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress.

						LOGAN
			All right. Now you keep your
			bargain.

						BOX (rapt by his
					work) 
			Wait for the wind! Wait and hear
			the birds sing over you!

						LOGAN (only interested
					in getting out)
			We're ready.

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern.

250		INT. - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica.

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide.

It stretches back as far as the eye can see.

The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear.

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:

251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN

Standing in erect positions.

At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works
of sculpture.

But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear
ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been
frozen.

252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.

253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN	
		IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands.
	
Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number
above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the
voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing
Runners.

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box.

254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him.

						LOGAN (stupefied) 
			How did they get in here?

						BOX
			Regular storage procedure...the
			same as the other food... The
			other food stopped coming and they
			started.
	
						LOGAN
			What other food?

						BOX
			Fish and plankton, sea greens and
			protein from the sea.
					(pointing to the frosted
					ice wall)
			It's all here - ready - fresh as
			harvest day. Fish and plankton,			
			sea greens and protein from the
			sea...And then it stopped coming
			and they (gesture) came instead.
			So I store them here. I'm ready.
			And you're ready. It's my Job -
			protein, plankton, grass from the
			sea

Logan pulls out his gun.

						LOGAN	
			Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll	
			destroy you..I'll kill you!

Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then:

						BOX (calmly)
			Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand
			you facing one another.
		
Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan.

Box is now like an armed vehicle.

Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame.

						BOX (advancing)
			Resign yourself.

255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail.

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and:

256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.

257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as:

258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them.

259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall.

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving
his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or
button which might open it.

The entire time he never takes his eyes off:

260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY.

						BOX (chilling tone) 
			I make such a small, quick incision ...
			you can hardly feel it.

261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above
them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables.

262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX
	
Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down
alongside her.

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as:

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling.

There is an EXPLOSION.

						BOX (looking up; 
					screaming) 
			No! The coils!

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures.

						BOX (still screaming)	
			All my work!' All my work!!	

As Logan and Jessica stand:

263-270	OUT
			
270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS

Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases.

270x2	LOGAN

Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and
walls.

270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE	
		
Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern.
			
270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE	
	
Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over.
			
270x5	FULL SHOT	

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing.

270x6	BOX

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin, as the lights dim and
flicker out.

270X7	ANGLE

The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again
and again like great spears and wedges 

270X8	BOX
	
Buried in his work, still feebly moving, then still as the roaring
ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
	
270X9	LOGAN AND JESSICA
 
Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave.

270X10	FULL SHOT	
	
The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in, going out of focus. Silence.
Then:

SOUND: Ice melting, water running.

270X11	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Stir in the dimness, amazed to be alive.

SOUND: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water.

As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again. They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall. Water rains across the opening.

Logan and Jessica make their way to it, step out.

271-272	OUT

273		EXT. - HIGH LEDGE

Water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt.

They are blinded by:

274		SUNSHINE: A HUGE RISING SUN	

As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes...then realizing that the
dazzling light will not go away:

Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.

						JESSICA 		
			Is there something on fire!!	 

Logan shakes his head...he doesn't know.

As Logan looks up at the sun.
			
						LOGAN
			It seems to be moving away.
			Come on...

274X1	ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge.

274X2	LOWER - AN AREA OF BOULDERS	

Suddenly, a FAIRLY STRONG WIND starts blowing.

						JESSICA (frightened) 
			What's that?

						LOGAN 
			It feels like breath. It makes 
			everything move. Your hair is moving.

						JESSICA (smiling) 
			And yours.

They reach the level below and pause, look around.

						LOGAN
			Jessica -- we must be outside!

She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they
set out again.

275-276	OUT

276X1	INT. - CAVE - CLOSE ON FRANCIS

Picking his way through the ruined cave, puzzled.

277-287X1	
OUT

288		EXT . - FOREST AREA

As Logan and Jessica reach it.

They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment...then
continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched,
etcetera.

A swarm of insects attack...Logan and Jessica fight them off:

						JESSICA (starting to panic)
			I hate outside! I hate it!

						LOGAN (holding her; 
					comforting tone)
			We'll be all right...
					(a beat)
			We will...

The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in
the grass...startling them for a moment.
		
288XA1	FRANCIS
Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the
unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica
did.
		
288XB1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA

They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them
and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth...Jesslca
grabs hold of his hand.

						JESSICA
			Don't!

						LOGAN
			Sooner or later, we'll have to try
			something

Logan eats the berries...as Jessica watches intently.

After a beat

						LOGAN
			They're good.

Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished: 

						JESSICA
			It's getting dark and cold.	
			I'm tired.		

						LOGAN 
			Why don't we rest here? We know we can 
			eat these.

They sit on the ground.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

288X1	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA - NIGHT	

Sitting on the ground.

Jessica is shivering. Logan has his arms around her trying to keep
her warm. 

						JESSICA 
			Where do you think that heat-ball went?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA
			Do you think everything's going to
			turn to ice?

						LOGAN
 			I doubt it.
	
						JESSICA
			Don't ever let go.

						LOGAN
			I won't.
	
After a long beat:

						LOGAN
			It all seemed to make sense until
			Box.

						JESSICA
			Do you think he was telling the
			Truth?

Logan shrugs.

						JESSICA (trying to 
					convince herself) 
			Maybe we're the first ones to get 
			through... 
					(hopeful tone) 
			Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... 
			another protected place. It couldn't 
			be outside.

						LOGAN (grunts) 
			How would anyone know? Even if we find 
			it -- we can never go back.

At her stricken look...Logan touches her in a caring way.

						LOGAN
			You're right...it must be near
			now. We'll find it.

						JESSICA (yawning;		
					closing her eyes; resting	
					on his shoulder)	
			Thirty thousand years didn't last
			very long, did they?
	
288X2	EXT. - BARREN TERRAIN - NIGHT - FRANCIS
	
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun
drawn.

Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.

Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun...blasting
the rabbit to smithereens.

He is breathing hard (fear)...and looking around...gun in hand.

288X3	EXT. - FOREST AREA - DAY - LOGAN AND JESSICA

walking in the hot sun...grimy...thirsty.

288X4	EXT. - FOREST AREA - FRANCIS

His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very
cautiously.

He reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the
ground.

He picks a few off the bush...is ravenous...but finally...too
frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any.

As he angrily crushes the berries in his hand... then wipes his hand
on his trousers:

288X5	EXT. - FOREST AREA - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Seeing shimmering in the distance. They walk toward it.

288X6-
288X8	TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

Reaching...

289		FULL ANGLE - A BROOK

They rush to it...drink...then undress...swim...and as they embrace
in the water:

						JESSICA
			Logan!!!Look!!
					(Logan turns around)
			No...your palm...look!!! 	

Logan looks at his palm...the blinking crystal is clear.

He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm... the same.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			What does it mean?
	
						LOGAN (trying to
					assimilate its meaning
					himself)
			The Lifeclocks have no power outside. 

Jessica takes Logan's palm and kisses it.

						JESSICA (with laughter)
			You can have any woman in the city.
			What do you really want?

						LOGAN (straight)
			You know, Jessica.

						JESSICA. (a beat)
			...But I still have the choice...?

						LOGAN
			Of course.

						JESSICA
			Then the answer's Yes...

They embrace there in the water...
			
290 		OUT

						LOGAN

Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.

			on them. I wonder what they are?

						JESSICA
			"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife".
			What can all that mean?
		
Just then their attention is focused by a distant SOUND as of
SHOUTING -- a man's voice. Jessica stops.
		
						JESSICA
			Francis?
		
Logan shakes his head. They EXIT cemetery toward capitol.
		
301X17	LONG SHOT - CAPITOL (MATTE COMPOSITE)

Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building.

301X18	TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Walking up the steps...many of which are cracked.

They are proceeding with great caution...as they enter the Capitol
Building.

301X19	INT. - CAPITOL ROTUNDA - LONG SHOT - (MATTE COMPOSITE)
		
Logan and Jessica enter the ancient room. They stop and look around.

301X20	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

SOUND: HAMMERING NOISE -- irregular. It stops after a bit.

They walk to the door and open it cautiously.

They EXIT right.

301X21	INT. - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SENATE
	
Logan and Jessica walking down corridor, left to right.
	
The SOUND continues.
		
301X22	INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

Logan and Jessica as Logan opens the aged door.

301X22A	CLOSEUP - A CAT SQUALLING OUT INTO CAMERA

301X23	CLOSEUP - LOGAN AND JESSICA	

React, then they enter Senate and stop and look.

301X24	INT. - SENATE - OVER LOGAN AND JESSICA'S BACK - A WHITE
		HAIRED MAN OF S SIXTY-PLUS	

There are HUNDREDS OF CATS...and THOUSANDS OF BOOKS all over the
place.

						JESSICA (frowning; 
					whispering)
			Look at his face...and his hair... 
					(grimacing)
			Is that what it is to grow old?

						LOGAN (still stunned)
			It could be...

There are a COUPLE OF CATS on the man's lap as he turns and faces
Logan and Jessica...when he HEARS them move closer.

The man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance
of Logan and Jessica.

						LOGAN
			How old are you?		

						MAN
			As old as I am I suppose...who
			knows ?

						LOGAN 
			Your hair is white.

						MAN		
			It wasn't always. I remember when		
			it wasn't. But it wasn't your	
			color either.
					(looking at Jessica) 
			...or yours. I have my color somewhere.

						JESSICA
			Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?

						MAN 
			Oh, no...

						JESSICA 
			Could I touch them?

						MAN
			Oh, my...please try.

Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.

						JESSICA 
			What's your name?

						MAN
			I've forgotten. It's been so
			long since I've used it.
	
Logan and Jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come
upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.
	
						MAN
			But all of my cats have names.
	
						LOGAN
			Is that what they're called--
			cats?

						OLD MAN
			Yes, cats, of course. What else
			could they be? Cats. Of course
			each one has his own name too.
	
						JESSICA
			But there are so many of them.
			Do you know each one separately.
		
						OLD MAN
			Yes indeed, everyone. Actually,
			they all have three.
					(reciting)
			"The naming of cats is a difficult
			matter. It isn't just one of your
			holiday games. You may think at	
			first I'm mad as a hatter when I	
			tell you a cat must have THREE
			DIFFERENT NAMES."
					(a beat)
			An ordinary name and a fancy name.
			That's two. Do you want to guess
			what the third one is?
		
Logan and Jessica are silent.

						OLD MAN (reciting again)	
			"But above and beyond there's	
			still one name left over,	
			And that is the name that you
			never will guess;
			The name that no human research
			can discover -- -
			But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and
			will never confess."
					(reaching down and
					stroking another cat)
			Will you, my pet?
		
One of the cats jumps off his lap.

						OLD MAN (reciting)
			"Why did you go little fourpaws?
			You forgot to shut your big eyes."
					(the man closes his
					eyes for a moment; then:)
			"I have a Gumble Cat in mind!"
		
As the man opens his eyes:
	
						LOGAN
			How long have you been living
			here?
	
						OLD MAN
			For as long as I can remember.
	
						LOGAN
			What kind of place is this?
	
						OLD MAN
			Just a place, I suppose...who
			knows?

The man looks puzzled.

						LOGAN
			How did you get here?

						OLD MAN
			I have always been here...

						LOGAN			
			Are there any other humans?	
	
						OLD MAN
			Gracious...no.

						LOGAN 
			Have any other people ever passed 
			through?

The man shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN 
			But there may be a few around somewhere.

						LOGAN 
			What makes you think so?

						OLD MAN 
			My parents thought so. Mother and 
			Father. You know?

						LOGAN (astonished) 
			Mother and -- ? You knew your mother 
			and father?

The man nods.

						JESSICA 
			And...and how were you grown? Inside
			your mother?

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						JESSICA 
			Are you sure?

						OLD MAN 
			Mother and Father said so... you know?

						LOGAN 
			Where are they?

						OLD MAN
			Dead...they're dead...and buried.

						JESSICA (not knowing
					what it is)
			Buried???

Logan wheels...as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING
SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider:

302		CLOSE ON A CAT

Coming through the opening - did he push it?

303		CLOSE ON THE MAN

						OLD MAN (pleased; 
					reciting) 
			"Gus is the cat at the theatre door. 
			His name, as I ought to have told 
			you before, Is really Asparagus. 
			That's such a fuss To pronounce, 
			that we usually call him just Gus."

306		WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN AND JESSICA	

						OLD MAN
			May I see your hand again?

Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them,
looks from one to another with delight.
		
						OLD MAN
			They're beautiful. May I have
			one too please?
		
						LOGAN
			No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
			
						OLD MAN (offended)
			It isn't fair. I'll give you one
			of my favorite cats...a Jellicle
			cat.
					(reciting)
			"Jellicle cats have cheerful faces,
			Jellicle cats have bright black eyes;
			They like to practice their airs and graces
			And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."


						LOGAN	
			I'm sorry but I don't have anything to 
			give you.	
		
As the man continues to look petulant:

						JESSICA (simply; 
					sincerely)
			That's the truth.

Jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.

						JESSICA
			Here you can have this.

The man seems pleased.
	
						OLD MAN
			What kind of jewel is this?

						JESSICA
			I don't know.
	
						OLD MAN
			You're both full of secrets like
			Macavity.	
					(looking at the ring)
			Did you steal this?
	
						JESSICA
			No.
		
						OLD MAN 
					(reciting)
			"Macavity, Macavity, there's no
			one like Macavity,
			There never was a cat of such
			deceitfulness and suavity."
	
						LOGAN
			What's beyond this place - do you
			know?
	
						OLD MAN
			No, no, no
		
						LOGAN
			Did your Mother or Father ever
			mention another place?
	
						OLD MAN
			Never, never, ever. Nothing.

After a pause:

						LOGAN	
			May we stay here for a while?	
			We'd like to rest.	

						OLD MAN
			Of course you can stay. This
			belongs to the people.

						JESSICA
			What belongs to the people?

						OLD MAN
			All this. All of it.
		
						JESSICA
			What people?
			
						OLD MAN
			I don't know...but it does.

The man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining
room.

						OLD MAN
			I'll be right back.
					(stopping)
			Oh, yes...about the cats...
			one rule is true:
					(reciting)
			"Don't speak till you are spoken to."
			
The man smiles and leaves.
		
305		LOGAN AND JESSICA 	

Logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down.

Jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it.

Logan is deep in thought.

Jessica looks up from the book.

						JESSICA (quietly)
			How curious people used to be --
			All these books...

Silence...until:

						LOGAN
			That sweet madman -- how could he
			Come to exist?
	
						JESSICA	
			He had a mother and father --	
			and he knew them.	

						LOGAN
			One in a million, I suppose

						LOGAN AND JESSICA (together; 
					smiling) 
			...Who knows? 

						JESSICA (after a beat) 
			We're going on, aren't we?

						LOGAN 
					(shaking his head) 
			There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.

Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:

						JESSICA 
			There's a Sanctuary...there is!

						LOGAN
			You want there to be one...that
			Doesn't...

						JESSICA (interrupting; 
					urgent tone) 
			There has to be! I know it exists! It 
			has to!!

						LOGAN (gently) 
			No, there doesn't. Not really --just so 
			many want it to exist...so many who 
			don't want to die...want it so much 
			that a place called Sanctuary becomes 
			"real". But it doesn't exist. It never 
			existed. Just the hope.

						JESSICA (becoming	
					hysterical)
			You're wrong!! It has to be!!
			It Just has to be!!

As Logan takes her in his arms...comforting her:

306		FULL ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MAN

The man returns with a portrait in hand.

						OLD MAN	
			Oh, my don't cry.

The man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of
himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair...which is rich
auburn.

						OLD MAN (gesturing) 
			There are larger pictures of other 
			people over there. I don't know who 
			they are. Perhaps they're family.

She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.

307		CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

Remaining near the podium. She is dejected. Logan's argument that
there is no Sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.

308 		OUT

308x1	THE CORNER - LOGAN AND THE OLD MAN

We see portraits of Presidents of the United States.

We can recognize all of them...with the exception of the dozen or so
that come after Ford.

As Logan looks at the portraits he recognizes Lincoln.

						LOGAN 
			That's the same fellow who's outside. 
			If he was so important - why isn't he 
			first?

The old man shakes his head.

309		INT - SENATE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON - JESSICA	

As Francis suddenly appears alongside her.

Jessica is terrified...speechless. Francis glances across the
chamber, sees Logan. When he speaks, it is softly but urgently.

						FRANCIS 
			What did you do to him?

Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.

						FRANCIS	
			Why? Why you?	
					(grabbing her)	
			Do you know you ruined him? Do
			you know that? Can you tell me
			why? Why you?
					(a beat)
			And now you've killed him, you
			know...

Francis starts to tear off her clothes...obviously to rape...but his
expression remains cold and without passion.

						JESSICA (screaming) 
			Logan!!!

As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
O.S.

310 		OUT

310x1	LOGAN

hears the scream, wheels -- sees nothing for a moment.

311		INT. - SENATE CHAMBER

						FRANCIS' VOICE 
			Here!!!!

Logan looks up...and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of
the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan,
holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.

						OLD MAN (cheerfully) 
			How nice...more company...

						FRANCIS (emotional; 
					disjointed thoughts) 
			We had such good times together... 
			I let you go! 
					(frenzied) 
			You didn't terminate a Runner and 
			I let you go!!
					(a beat)
			She did this to us! How could you
			let her?! An ordinary available??!!
					(with this he flings
					Jessica down and away.
					She lies there...stunned)
			And what about Logan-6 and Francis-8? 
					(a tear in his eye)
			....Why didn't you chink about them?!
					(up a notch)
			There's over two hundred years of
			Sandmen's blood in you, Logan....
			and now you'll spill it for a
			stinking Runner!!

312		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Holding up his right palm.

						LOGAN 
			Look at your palm, Francis.... 
			look! It's clear. Clear!

313		REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS

Looking at his palm....shocked...dropping his gun. It falls on the
CHAMBER FLOOR.

						FRANCIS 
			Why did you do that??!!

						LOGAN
			I didn't do anything, Francis!
			They've made us believe that....

						FRANCIS (interrupting; 
					wild) 
			Why did you do that???!!!

Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.

314		WIDE ANGLE - CATS

Scattering in all directions as:

315-319	CLOSE ACTION SHOTS - FRANCIS AND LOGAN

In hand to hand combat punching...Kicking...wrestling

320		INTERCUT WITH: JESSICA AND THE MAN REACTING

Jessica deeply disturbed...The man enjoying himself as if Logan and
Francis were putting on a show for him.

321-331	THE FIGHT- SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on Logan.

B. As Logan slumps to the floor and Francis cries to follow through
his advantage by crushing Logan's face with his foot:

C. Logan grabs Francis' foot and twists it...sending Francis reeling
backward.

D. Standing, Logan grabs a table and hurls it at Francis...who
ducks.

E. Francis sees a steel flagpole (with an American flag that has
sixty-one stars) and takes hold of it.

F. Francis moves toward Logan...with the menacing steel flagpole in
front of him.

G. Logan is wary...watching every movement of the steel pole.

H. Francis swings the steel pole twice...We can HEAR the WHISH-WHISH
as it cuts through the air...with Logan avoiding the blows.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

Logan touches Francis' hand and Francis grasps his wrist, holding
death off with the strong grip.

						FRANCIS (delirious)	
			That was the right shot--Look out	
			there, he's trying to break free		
			Watch it, Logan, steady, now!......

His eyes focus briefly and he sees Logan's palm-the crystal shining
clear and white. Francis is suddenly radiant.

						FRANCIS 
			Logan! You renewed!

And he is dead.	DIRECT CUT TO:
	
332		JESSICA AND THE MAN

The man walks over to Francis and bends down.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...he died...

333		CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Rubbing his face with the palms of his hands...clearly upset.

334		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JESSICA AND THE MAN

						OLD MAN
			We¹ll have to bury him.

						JESSICA
			What¹s that?

						OLD MAN
			They¹re put into the ground so
			they can be visited by the living...

Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears.  The man starts out.

						OLD MAN
			I¹ll make the arrangements.

						JESSICA (softly)
			At least it¹s over...

Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head...then:

						OLD MAN
			Are you ready to put him in?
	
						LOGAN
			Not yet.

						OLD MAN
			All right.

The man sits down.

Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body...trying to straighten him out
from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the
floor.

After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again.  He cradles Francis¹
head in his arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

335-338	OUT

						OLD MAN'S VOICE 
			"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there 
			in the fragrant silent night."

339X1	CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY

As they look down at Francis' body...in the open grave.

Jessica watches as Logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the
grave...starting to fill it.

339X2	JESSICA

quietly watching:

DISSOLVE TO:
		
339X3	INT. - SENATE - NEXT MORNING

On Logan sleeping - Jessica and Old Man in a spirited but soft
conversation in a far corner.

As Logan wakes he hears:

						OLD MAN
			Of course...that's settled then.
			But just you remember your promise...

						JESSICA 
			We'll remember. But that's a long time 
			off...

She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan
rises to her.

						LOGAN 
			What are we promising him? What can we 
			possibly give him?

						JESSICA 
			He asked if we would bury him when his 
			time comes.

						 LOGAN (beat)
			We can't. We're going back.

						JESSICA 
			To what?

						LOGAN		
			I'm going to try and tell people what 
			we've seen and--

						JESSICA (interrupting) 
			You're lying! You'll never have the 
			chance to tell anybody anything! 
			You'll be killed the moment you're seen!

						LOGAN 
			Do you expect me to let things go on 
			without trying to change them?!

						JESSICA 
			Things won't change...you know that! 
			We can live here together, Logan...
			have a life as long as his... together!

						LOGAN (showing his palm) 
			Things change!

						JESSICA
			You want to go back to kill, is that it?! 
			Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill 
			Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!

Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical.

						LOGAN (softly) 
			Jessica...listen to me...listen to me...
					(as she quiets down)
			The Lifeclocks made me kill
			Francis. They make people die or
			be killed every day. If I didn't
			try and destroy that...I couldn't
			live here or anywhere. Do you
			understand?

						JESSICA
			I want to be alive and with you,
			that's all I want.

Logan puts his arms around her.

						LOGAN 
			I know...I know...

The Old Man comes to them, wondering.

						LOGAN 
			We're leaving.

						 OLD MAN		
			What a pity. I was hoping you'd	
			be here to bury me.	

						JESSICA 
			Come with us.

						OLD MAN 
			Where are you going?

						LOGAN 
			To a city with thousands and thousands 
			of people.

						OLD MAN 
			Alive?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN 
			Thousands and thousands...as many as 
			my cats?

						LOGAN 
			More...many more.

						OLD MAN 
			And all alive you say?

Logan nods.

						OLD MAN
			Yes, I would like to see that. Is it 
			a long journey?

Again, Logan nods.

						OLD MAN (mumbling) 
			Thousands and thousands alive... oh, my...

340-349	OUT

350		HIGH ANGLE - GREENBELT AREA - SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

Logan, Jessica and the Old MAN are walking...with the Capitol
Building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b.g. of the
SHOT.	

351-361 	OUT

361X1	EXT. - FOREST AREA - AFTERNOON

The Old Man has picked Some wild vegetables...and hands a piece to
Logan and a piece to Jessica.

As they hesitate...the Old Man bites into it... heartily. 

As Logan and Jessica start eating it, too:

						OLD MAN (marveling tone) 
			Never see the sun or the moon... 
			I hope we get there soon...

361X1A	NIGHT - WOODED AREA - CLOSE	

On Logan, Jessica and the Old Man as they emerge from a small grove
of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						OLD MAN (weary but
					enthusiastic)
			Is that really it? It doesn't
			seem very far. Will we be there
			soon?

						LOGAN
			I promise. We '11 go on as soon
			as it's light.

						JESSICA (gently, 
					turning O.M. away) 
			But now I'm tired. Let's go back to 
			the fire...

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.

P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)

NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.

361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

As the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.

						OLD MAN 
			That's better than gold when it's cold.

						LOGAN		
			Thank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...

						OLD MAN
			My father was the husband and my
			mother was the wife. "Beloved" is	
			a word they used - to stay together.

						LOGAN 
			Stay? They lived together all their years?

						OLD MAN 
			Oh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading; 
					moved) 
			³Beloved son²... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that 
			feeling of love... They would live and 
			raise children together and be remembered. 
					(another beat) 
			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we 
			be that way?

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)

						JESSICA		
			And Sanctuary?		

						LOGAN 
			Sanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

						JESSICA (whispering)
			Beloved husband...

						LOGAN (kissing her)
			Beloved wife...

As they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.

362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAY

Walking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.

363 		OUT

364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN

Approaching. The wave power inlet in f.g. They

HEAR: THE ROAR OF THE WATER

As they approach cautiously...they see:

365		WAVE POWER INLET

Waves pounding over ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION...
DESCENDING TO A VORTEX.

						JESSICA
			What does that water do?

						LOGAN
			It's part of the hydrogalvanic
			system. The ocean tides are changed
			into energy somehow.

						JESSICA
			Is it inside the city?

						LOGAN
			Of course.
					(a beat)
			I don't know where...
					(frowning)
			I Just took them for granted. 
					(Logan takes Jessica's hand)
			It's our only chance.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:

366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATER

At the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:
		
						LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this
			way. I don't think you can make it.

						OLD MAN (sadly)
			Oh...I did so look forward to seeing
			all those people.

						LOGAN
			I'm sorry.

						OLD MAN
			Yes...

						LOGAN
			Can you make it back?

						OLD MAN
			Oh my...I'll try. 

						JESSICA (kissing the Old Man)
			Goodbye.

						OLD MAN
			Oh, my...

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.

367		THE OLD MAN

he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.

368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICA 

Emerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.

369-
369Xl 	OUT

369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

As the CROWD is pouring in:

						LOGAN'S VOICE
			No!! Don't go in there !!

The CROWD turns and looks up at:

369X2	LOGAN

On a high balcony in the Great Hall.

Looking down at them.

						LOGAN 
			You don't have to die!! No one has 
			to die at thirty!!! You don't have 
			to blink out on Lastday. There's no 
			renewal on Carrousel! You can live 
			longer and grow old... I've seen it.
			She's seen it!! Believe me!!

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

						LOGAN (holding up
					his palm)
			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!

369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMEN

Trying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:

370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREA

It is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:
	
		PROBABILITY	
				
blinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.

371		CLOSE ANGLE - LOGAN IN THE CHAIR

A shaft of light glows on and he stiffens - bound by it.

372 		OUT

372X1-
372X3	FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE SCREEN

As around him in the air, a series of spectral greenish HEADS appear
-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.

378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING IN
		AGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.

ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADS

A. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS
					(Logan's voice)
			A Jewelry store. 

B. Logan himself - twisting in pain.

C. The word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.

D.						A SECOND HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			A creature called Box - all frozen, 
			all frozen.

E. Logan writhes in the chair.		
			
F. Again the word NEGATIVE appears on the SCREEN.	

G. 						A THIRD IDENTICAL HEAD
					(Logan's Voice)
			No...There is no Sanctuary.

H. The SCREEN seems to shimmer. It blinks.

I. A third time the word negative appears on the SCREEN.

J. 						A FOURTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary

K. The SCREEN'S glow increases...to an almost blinding light...
starting to frighten the Sandmen present.

L. At the same time, we see JESSICA coming out of her tranquilized
daze...fearful...still in the Sandmen's custody.

M.						A FIFTH HEAD
					(Logan's voice)
			An old man without a crystal...But
			there is no Sanctuary.

N. Now the SCREEN is starting to spark. Behind it we SEE the
intermittent glow of overheated electronic components.

O. And we see the word negative...once more on the SCREEN -- but
broken now.

P. 						A SIXTH HEAD 
					(Logan's voice)
			There is no Sanctuary.

Q. Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking...and we
can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.

R. On the SCREEN the word negative is beginning to shake...as the
SCREEN begins to shake.

379		FULL ANGLE - THE SIX HEADS

						LOGAN'S VOICE (emanating
					 from all of them)
			There is no Sanctuary. There is
			no Sanctuary.

The sign PROBABILITY bursts...the SIX HEADS of Logan go out.	 

The noise and the light coming out of the screen Increase, as it
begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame.

380-410 	OUT

410X1	ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

Straining twisting, as the light above him bursts, goes out in a
puff of smoke -- releasing him. Logan staggers to his feet in time
to meet:

410X2	SANDMEN

Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in
on Logan One holding Jessica.

410X3	LOGAN AND SANDMEN
	
Manages to get one of the Sandmen's guns, instantly blasting him
with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.

410X4	THE BATTLE

The electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.
Crouched, they make for the exit.

410X5	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE. SCREEN	

Sputtering its life out in strange predictive words....PROBABILITY
flashing on and off.... EQUILIBRIUM...DESTRUCT...EQUIL...NO
BALANCE...NO BALANCE...FAMINE... INACCEPTABLE ...NO BALANCE...etc.,
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges
which fill the great room.

410X6	SANDMEN

The battle is lost -- the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up
their wounded and get out as best they can.

410X7	INT. SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY

Sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of
fire behind them.

410X8	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

Sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects. Pushing through
passers-by herding everyone away from the scene.

People getting the hell out of there.

Ad Libs: Get away from here. The whole thing's going.

410X9	INT. LIFECLOCK ROOM

Through the smoke, etc. The Lifeclocks EXPLODE.

410X10	EXT. SANDMAN H.Q.

The building EXPLODES -- great geyser of flame shooting upward.

410X11	GREAT HALL

The sound of the explosion creates panic. Lights begin to flicker.
The great red crystal lights fitfully on and off. People are
panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.

410X12	CAROUSEL

As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.

410X13	GREAT HALL

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

410X14	ARCADE

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

410X15-
X21		PANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS

A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.


410X22	EXT. - DOMED CITY - FIRE FX AND CRACKING 

INTERCUT with above:

410X23	LOGAN AND JESSICA

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,
running O.S. past Maze Car Station.

410X24	LOGAN AND JESSICA
		
Running past Power Center.

411	EXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT

The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
	
We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.

          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR

          It came to me. My own.     My love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

SLOW MOTION: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to the
MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

                      BILBO
                (surprised)
            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight

mouth, Frodo runs off.

          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3

          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

                     FRODO
           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.

          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

                    GANDALF
          So am I, dear boy...so am I

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

          Bilbo Baggins!

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

                    BILBO
          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the
          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not
          some block headed Bracegirdle from
          Hardbottle!

                    GANDALF
          You will tell him, won't you?

          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at
          Gandalf sadly...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    BILBO
          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Ohhhh,

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT

BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above
Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding
branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

                    BILBO
          Whether it be turned on a spit or minced
          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

                    MERRY
              (urgent whisper)
          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin
          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK
          FUSE crackles with flame!

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
              (worried whisper)
          You're supposed to stick it in the
          ground!

                    PIPPIN
          It is in the ground.

Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     MERRY
          Outside!

                    PIPPIN
          It was your idea.

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!

                    BILBO
          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

ANGLE ON: FRODO

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    MERRY
          That was good!

                    PIPPIN
          Let's get another one!

LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.
Low angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!

MERRY AND PIPPIN

Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy
water...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and
sipping an ale. Cries of "SPEECH! SPEECH" erupt from the
party.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo stepping on a stool...he bows in gratitude at the
applause.

                       FRODO
          Speech!

                    BILBO
              (clearing throat)
          My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and
          Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs,
          Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and
          Proudfoots...

ANGLE ON: A HOBBIT WITH PARTICULARLY BIG FEET

                       ODO PROUDFOOT
          Proudfeet!

                    BILBO
          Today is my one hundred and eleventh
          birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one
          years is far too short a time to live
          among such excellent and admirable
          Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I don't know half of you half as well as
          I should like; and I like less than half
          of you as well as well as you deserve.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and
holds it behind his back.

          I have..things to do and I have put this
          off for far too long... CLOSE ON: BILBO'S
          knuckles turn white as he tightens his
          grip on the small object behind his back.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I regret to announce, this is the end. I
          am going now. I bid you all a very fond
          farewell!! Bilbo looks across at Frodo,
          hesitates... then...

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (whisper)
          Goodbye.

Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an
uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet.

ANGLE ON: FRODO

staring at the empty stool in disbelief.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away
as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End.
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand.

INT. BAG END -- NIGHT

The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a
plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He
finds Gandalf looming over him.

                    GANDALF
          I suppose you think that was terribly
          clever?

                    BILBO
          Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their
          faces?

                    GANDALF
          There are many magic rings in the world,
          Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    BILBO
          It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    GANDALF
          You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

                    BILBO
          I'm leaving everything to him.

                    GANDALF
          What about this ring of yours?   Is that
          staying too?

Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after
          all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?

                    GANDALF
          I think you should leave the Ring behind,
          Bilbo. Is that so hard?

                    BILBO
          Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it,
          I don't feel like parting with it. It's
          mine. I found it. It came to me!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN.

                    GANDALF
          There's no need to get angry.

                    BILBO
          Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's
          mine. My own, my precious.

CONTINUED:


                    GANDALF
          Precious? It's been called that before,
          but not by you.

                    BILBO
          So? What business is it of yours what I
          do with my own things? Bilbo's voice,
          shape and manner have suddenly changed.

                    GANDALF
          I think you've had that ring quite long
          enough.

                    BILBO
          You want it for yourself!

Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow
suddenly seems to fill the room

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some
          conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers
          from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a
          frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression
          softens.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          I am not trying to rob you. I am trying
          to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to
          Gandalf and hugs him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          All you long years we've been
          friends...trust me as you once did. Let
          it go!

                    BILBO
          You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go
          to Frodo.

Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          It's late, the road is long... yes, it is
          time.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo?

                    BILBO
          Hmmm?

          The ring is still in your pocket.

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     BILBO
          Oh, yes.

CLOSE ON: Bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. CLOSE ON:
The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.

Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.

                    BILBO
          I've thought up and ending for my
          book..."And he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    GANDALF
          I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    BILBO
          Goodbye, Gandalf.

                    GANDALF
          Goodbye Bilbo.

Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night,
softly singing: "The Road goes on and on."

              (softly)
          Until our next meeting.

Hum rises on the soundtrack. Gandalf is sitting in front of
the fire, with his pipe...staring into the flickering flames.

          Bilbo! Bilbo!

Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          He talked for so long about leaving...I
          didn't think he'd really do it.

          ...my own.

                     FRODO
          Gandalf?

Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's
fingers.

                    GANDALF
          Bilbo's ring.

Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's
          left you Bag End...

Gandalf holds out the envelope...Frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          ...along with all his possessions.

Gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   He hands it to Frodo.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          The ring is yours now. But it somewhere
          out of sight. Gandalf rises hurriedly and
          starts to gather his things.

                    FRODO
          Where are you going?

                    GANDALF
          I have some things I must see to.

                    FRODO
          What things?

                       GANDALF
          Questions.     Questions that need
          answering.

                    FRODO
          You've only just arrived!    I don't
          understand...

Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.

                    GANDALF
          Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it
          safe.

Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone
in the Bag End.

fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.

          Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite
          cool.

Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand...he reacts to its
weight.

Mordor?

In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One
ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."

          Sauron himself.

          Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.

                    GANDALF
          For sixty years the ring lay quiet in
          Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life,
          delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo.
          Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has
          awoken. It has heard its master's call.

emanates from the Ring.   Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing

                    GANDALF
          No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has
          endured. His life force is bound to the
          ring and the ring survived. Sauron has
          returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his
          fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the
          land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this
          ring to cover all the lands in the second
          darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it,
          all his thought is bent on it. For the
          ring yearns, above all else, to return to
          the hand of its master: they are one, the
          ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must
          never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up
          the Ring.

                    SARUMAN
          Sauron has regained much of his former
          strength. He cannot yet take physical
          form...but his spirit has lost none of
          its potency. Concealed within his
          fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all.
          His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
          and flesh. You know of what I speak,
          Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed
          in flame.

                    GANDALF
              (softly)
          The eye of Sauron.

                    SARUMAN
          He is gathering all evil to him.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Very soon he will have summoned an army
          great enough to launch an assault upon
          Middle earth.

                    GANDALF
          You know this? How?

                    SARUMAN
          I have seen it.

Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

                    GANDALF
          A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir.

                     SARUMAN
          Why?   Why should we fear to use it?

                    GANDALF
          They are not all accounted for, the lost
          seeing-stones...we do not know who else
          may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth
          back over the Palantir.

                    SARUMAN
          The hour is later than you think.
          Sauron's forces are already moving...the
          Nine have left Minas Morgul.

                    GANDALF
              (shocked)
          The nine!

                    SARUMAN
          They crossed the river Isen in
          Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.

                    GANDALF
              (alarmed)
          They have reached the Shire? Saruman
          shrugs...

                    SARUMAN
          They will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.

Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          You did not seriously think a Hobbit
          could contend with the will of Sauron?
          There are none who can.

Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman...a look of dawning horror.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
          Against the power of Mordor, there can be
          no victory. We must join with him,
          Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It
          would be wise, my friend.

                    GANDALF
              (deadly)
          Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?

At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his
feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING!
Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is
flung to the floor.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    SARUMAN
          I gave you the chance of aiding me
          willingly, but you have elected the way
          of pain.

Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of Saruman... Commanding two staffs, Saruman
sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. Rushing
POV: the roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera.

EXT. FARMER'S FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which
borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up...Frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     SAM
               (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns,
          surprised as Sam comes running towards
          him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (worried)
          I thought I lost you. Frodo looks at Sam
          suspiciously. Sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    FRODO
              (teasing)
          What are you talking about?

                    SAM
              (mumbling)
          It's just something Gandalf said...

                    FRODO
          What did he say?

                    SAM
          He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise
          Gamgee."
              (looks at Frodo intently)
          And I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (laughing)
          Sam...we're still in the Shire...what
          could possibly happen?

SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
Frodo flying. Frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by Pippin.

                     PIPPIN
          Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

                    MERRY
          Hello Frodo

Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    SAM
          What's the meaning of this!

                    MERRY
          Sam, hold this...

Merry gives Sam a large cabbage.

                    SAM
              (accusing)
          You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
Hedgerow...angry shouts from Farmer Maggot.

                    FARMER MAGGOT    (O.S.)
          Who's that in my field!     Get out of it!
          Get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          I'll show you...get out    of my corn.

Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with Frodo and Sam on their heels.

                    MERRY
              (looking behind him)
          I don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    PIPPIN
          And some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          And then the mushrooms the week before.

                    MERRY
          Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds!

EXT. WOODED ROAD -- DAY

Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down
a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. CLOSE ON: A winded Pippin,
his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings...

                    PIPPIN
          That was close.

Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly.

                    MERRY
              (groaning)
          Ow...I think I've broken something.

Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle,
out from his back pocket.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Oh.

                    SAM
              (turning on Merry and Pippin)
          Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.

                    MERRY
          What? That was just a detour...a
          shortcut.

                    SAM
          A shortcut to what?

Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of
the road.

                     PIPPIN
              (excited)
          Mushrooms!

CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy
undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the
mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are
on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling
down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...

                                                             41.



SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES...

                      FRODO
            I think we should get off the road.

A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some
evil and lonely creature.

                      FRODO (CONT'D)
                (more urgency)
            Get off the road!

Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble
down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES
is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into
view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black
horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The
RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits
very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the
hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an
elusive scent; his head turning from side to side.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly
slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering
suspiciously into the woods.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling
hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of
some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING
intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to
side like a bird of party.

CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...

QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A

BURST OF FLAME.

ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN

                      SAM
            Frodo?

Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the
ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far
side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly
slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken

          What was that?

Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring
lying in the palm of his hand.

EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT

Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the
trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground.

                      SAM
          Anything?

                      FRODO
          Nothing.

                    PIPPIN
          What is going on?

Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching
intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously.

                    MERRY
          The Black rider was looking for
          something...or someone...Frodo?

                      SAM
          Get down!

The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline.
The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their
breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs.

                    FRODO
          I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I
          must get to Bree.

Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep
trouble.

                    MERRY
          Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !

The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of
the forest TOWARD THEM!

                    MERRY (CONT'D)

          Get the ropes, Sam.

QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES...SNARLING HORSES...

Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the Fog...converging on
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and
Tumble onto the Ferry.

Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry.

CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF!

Sam and Merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. They pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! The Hobbits
cover their ears. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    FRODO
          How far to the nearest crossing?

          What do you want?

                    FRODO

The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing
them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight.

          Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more,
          out of the Shire by your talk. What
          business brings you to Bree?

                    FRODO

          Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.

          All right, young sir, I meant no offense.

The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree...the gatekeeper eyeing

          What do we do now?

INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT

Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG
FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam,
Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             46.
CONTINUED:


                    FRODO
          Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.

Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    PIPPIN
          What's that?

                    MERRY
          This, my friend, is a pint.

                    PIPPIN
          It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!

Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    SAM
          You've had a whole half already. Merry
          watches Pippin go.

A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at
Frodo, then quickly look away.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (tense)
          That fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur...

                    FRODO
          Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    BUTTERBUR
          He's one of them Rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. What his right name is, I never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          Strider.

                    FRODO
              (to himself)
          Strider.

BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE
RING.

                                                            47.



CLOSE ON: FRODO

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills
into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

                    PIPPIN
          Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's
          over there...

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    PIPPIN
              (loudly)
          Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    FRODO
          Pippin!

                    PIPPIN
          Steady on, Frodo!

Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to Frodo...

                                                      CLOSE ON:

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

EXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT

The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly
aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses
towards the distant lights of Bree.

INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT

Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into
excited babble.

                                        IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                      ANGLE ON:

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:
THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow
motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative
quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow
motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE
EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately
pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the
real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the
table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY!

INT. PRANCING PONY--CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Frodo is roughly pushed against the wall.    The Brooding

          yourself...Mr. Underhill

Frodo is pushed into the Hobbit's room by Strider.

                    FRODO
          What do you want?

                    STRIDER
          A little more caution from you...that is
          no trinket you carry.

                    FRODO
          I carry nothing.

CONTINUED:


                    STRIDER
          Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen
          if I wish, but to disappear entirely...
          that is a rare gift.

                    FRODO
          Who are you?

                    STRIDER
          Are you frightened?

                    FRODO
          Yes.

                    STRIDER
          Not nearly frightened enough. I know
          what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound
          of a noise in the corridor. Strider
          deftly draws his sword.

The door bursts open and Sam, Merry and Pippin appear on the
doorway. Sam is Squaring off with is fists, Merry brandishes
a candlestick, and Pippin a chair.

                    SAM
              (angry)
          Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!

STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his
lips.

                    STRIDER
          You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,
          but that alone won't save you...You can
          no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo.
          They're coming.

CRASH!!

The gate crashed down on the gatekeeper...as four RINGWRAITHS
ride into Bree!

STAB THE HOBBITS, in a Slashing, hacking frenzy.

Strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room.

INT. HOBBIT'S ROOM, PRANCING PONY -- NIGHT

Wide on: the RINGWRAITHS step back from the slashed beds in
triumph. CLOSE ON: a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal

shredded pillow is revealed! More Shrieks of rage. INSERT:

WIDE ON: Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on
Strider's bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window,
peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo
across the courtyard from the Hobbits room.

                    FRODO
          Where are they?

                    STRIDER
          They were once men. Strider glances

          Great Kings of men. Then Sauron the
          deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of
          Power. Blinded by their greed they took
          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

Strider looks from the window as the Ringwraiths gallop down
the Bree Streets. CLOSE ON: Strider turns back to the
Hobbits, his face lit faintly by the Glowing Embers of the
Fire.

                    STRIDER (CONT'D)
          They are the Nazgul, Ringwraiths, neither
          living or dead. At all times they feel
          the presence of the ring...drawn to the
          power of the one..they will never stop
          hunting you.

STRIDER, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy,
overgrown forest. Sam follows at the read leading "Bill", a
scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies.

          Where are you taking us?

                    STRIDER
          Into the wild.

Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of
the trees...

          How do, we know this Strider is a friend
          of Gandalf?

          You've already had it.

                    PIPPIN
          We've had one, yes...but what about
          Second Breakfast?

Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

                    MERRY
          I don't think he knows about second
          breakfast, Pip.

blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.

          No!

                                       IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks
upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:
Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.
With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off
his finger...

                                           IN THE REAL WORLD:

...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (horrified)
          Frodo!

Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech
fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the Weathertop
summit.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Mr. Frodo!!

Strider kneels before Frodo. He snatches up the Witch King's
Dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin,
blade.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Help him, Strider!

                     STRIDER
              (grim)
          He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The
          Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing
          into the air like smoke. Strider throws
          the hilt down in disgust...

                    STRIDER
          This is beyond my skill to heal.
              (urgently)
          He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts
          Frodo onto his shoulders.

EXT. WEATHERHILLS -- NIGHT

Strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing Frodo on his
back. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up. The
hobbits are carrying Flaming torches for protection.

                    STRIDER
          Hurry!

                    SAM
          We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo
          groans.

                    STRIDER
          Hold on, Frodo.

                     SAM
          He'll never make it! Close on:
          Frodo...head lolling about, barely
          conscious.

          Gandalf...Gandalf?

EXT. ISENGARD -- NIGHT

Low angle...looking up at ORTHANC...the tower of Isengard,
gleaming in the moonlight. The camera rises to reveal the
once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with
smoke and fire billowing out

of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt
of ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep
underground. The camera is rising...a small moth flutters
into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or
Orthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very
top of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. He
looks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTH
flutters close to Gandalf. His hand suddenly moves at
lighting speed and SNATCHES THE MOTH. Gandalf brings his hand
close to his face and opens it. The moth sits on the palm of
his hand as Gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue.
Close on: THE MOTH'S face... seemingly listening.

It suddenly flutters away. CAMERA FOLLOWS the moth off the
Orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down,
towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red
tunnel!

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- NIGHT

The dead trees of Isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. Saruman strides among the
ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand
before his master.

                    PIPPIN
          Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is
          getting shallow. Strider looks out into
          the darkness.

                    STRIDER
          No. He is passing into the shadow world,
          he will soon become a wraith like them.

A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.

                    MERRY
              (nervous)
          They're close.

Frodo gasps in sudden pain.

          Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam

          Athelas?

                       STRIDER
          Kingsfoil.

          He's fading...he's not gong to last. We
          must get him to my father. Strider
          quickly lifts Frodo...placing him on the
          horse.

                    ARWEN (CONT'D)

Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow
water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up
short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white
horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to
defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford.

                    WITCH KING
          Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws

Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water
flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had
burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing
white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in
terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing

                     SAM
          Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!!

                    GANDALF
          Sam has hardly left your side.

                    SAM
          We were worried about you--weren't we,
          Mr. Gandalf?

                    GANDALF
          By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're
          beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE
          HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's

bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.

                    ELROND
          Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
          Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with
          awe.

Buildings sitting in a Shangri-la like Valley below towering
cliffs and snow capped mountains.

          You have found your way to the last
          homely house east of the sea. The elves
          of Imladris have dwelt within this valley
          for three thousand years through few of
          my kin now remain. Frodo looks out from
          his balcony.

Frodo and Sam walk together. Suddenly, the voices of Merry
and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw
their arms around him.

                     MERRY
          Frodo!   Frodo!

Sam looks past Frodo smiling... a bent figure sits alone on a
bench, in the Sun. Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's
gaze...

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!

Close on: BILBO BAGGINS! He breaks in to a broad grin as
Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged
significantly since we last saw him.

                    BILBO
          Hello, Frodo, my lad!

                     FRODO
          Bilbo!

LATER... Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (reading)
          "There and back again: A Hobbit's tale"
          by Bilbo Baggins.

Bilbo smiles Proudly. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace
overlooking a Waterfall. Frodo looks at Page after page of
beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.

          This is wonderful.

                    BILBO
          I meant to go back...wander the paths of
          Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely
          Mountain again...but age, it seems, has
          finally caught up with me.

Frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the Shire.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          I miss the Shire...I spent all my
          childhood pretending I was off somewhere
          else...off with you, on one of your
          adventures...
              (Looks at Bilbo)
          But my own adventure, turned out to be
          quite different...I'm not like you,
          Bilbo.

                    BILBO
          My dear boy...

Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his
already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking
utensils, provisions, clothes.

                    SAM
          No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to
          reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket,
          watching Sam.

                    FRODO
          Packed already?

Sam looks up, startled.

                    SAM
              (slightly embarrassed)
          No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls
          to the edge of the Balcony.

                    FRODO
          I thought you wanted to see the Elves,
          Sam?

          More than anything.

                    SAM
          I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this
          far, to Rivendell...and I thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. Off home.

                    FRODO
          You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          ...we did what we set out to do. Frodo
          opens his hand, the Ring sits in his
          Palm.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am
          ready to go home.

Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony,

                    ELROND
          His strength returns.

                    GANDALF
          That wound will never fully heal. He will
          carry it the rest of his life.

                    ELROND
          And yet to have come so far still bearing
          the Ring...the hobbit has shown
          extraordinary resilience to its evil.

                    GANDALF
          It is a burden he should never have to
          had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.

                    ELROND
          Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's
          forces are massing in the east. His eye
          is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you
          tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of
          allies grows thin.

                    GANDALF
          His treachery runs deeper than you know.
          By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc
          with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of Isengard. An army that
          can move in Sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. Saruman is coming for
          the Ring.

Elrond turns and walks away...

                    ELROND
          This evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the Elves...We do not have the
          strength to fight both Mordor and
          Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

Gandalf turns and looks out the window.

Sounds of arrivals...Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through
Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This peril belongs to all Middle earth.
          They must decide how to end it. Not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. Elrond approaches Gandalf.

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          The time of the Elves is over. My people
          are leaving these shores. Who will you
          look to when we have gone? The dwarves?
          They hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. They care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    GANDALF
          It is in Men that we must place our hope.

                    ELROND
          Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is
          failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          It is because of men    the Ring survives.

FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off
Sauron's finger. Elrond reacts.

                    ELROND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was there, Gandalf...I was there three
          thousand years ago when Isildur took the
          ring.

FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT,

ENTRANCED.

                       ELROND

             failed.

             I let Isildur into the heart of Mount

Elrond turns to Gandalf.

             It should have ended that day, but evil
             was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the
             Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
             There's no strength left in the world of
             Men. They're scattered, divided,
             leaderless.

Strider watches from the shadows...as Boromir strolls through

Fresco on the wall...depicting Isildur defeating Sauron.
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of
Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet awe)
          The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut
          the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir
          picks up the sword and gently touches the
          Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood
          appears on Boromir's finger...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Still sharp.

Boromir senses Strider's presence...he looks from the blade
to Strider, as if sensing a connection.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          But no more than a broken heirloom.

          stands upon the brink of destruction.

          has no other master. Boromir turns and
          looks at Strider, coolly.

                    BOROMIR
          And what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.
LEGOLAS stands...

                    LEGOLAS
          This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,
          son of Arathorn. You owe him your
          allegiance.

Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.

                    BOROMIR
              (quiet disbelief)
          Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

                    LEGOLAS
          And heir to the throne of Gondor.

                    ARAGORN
              (Elvish: with subtitles)
          Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

                    BOROMIR
          Gondor needs no king.

                    GANDALF
          Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    ELROND
          You have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears.
Gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    GIMLI
          Then...what are we waiting for?

Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the
ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    ELROND
          The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son
          of Gloin, by any craft that we

                    ELROND (CONT'D)
          here possess. The ring was made in the
          fires of Mount Doom...only there can it
          be unmade. It must be taken deep into
          Mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. One of you
          must do this.

Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    BOROMIR
          One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          Orcs. There is evil there that does not
          sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful.
          It is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. It
          is folly.

                    LEGOLAS
          Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has
          said? The ring must be destroyed.

                    GIMLI
          And I suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    BOROMIR
          And if we fail, what then? What happens
          when Sauron takes back what is his?

Gimli leaps to his feet!

                    GIMLI
          I will be dead before I see the Ring in
          the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT
          erupts around the room. CLOSE ON:
          FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in
          slow

motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory
fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows
louder in his head.

                    GIMLI (CONT'D)
              (shouting)
          Never trust an Elf!

CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow
across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.

                    GANDALF
          Do you not understand? While we    bicker
          among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows!
          No one will escape it. You will   all be
          destroyed, your homes burnt and   your
          families put to the sword!

CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of
his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears
his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in
a strong, clear voice.

                    FRODO
          I will take it...I will take it...I will
          take the Ring to Mordor.

Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded
faces.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (quietly)
          Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf
          rises to his feet.

                    GANDALF
          I will help you bear this burden, Frodo
          Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.

                    ARAGORN
          If, by my life or death, I can protect
          you, I will.
              (kneels before Frodo)
          ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps
          forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.

          And you have my bow.

                    GIMLI
          And my axe.

Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo.

                    BOROMIR
          You carry the fate of us all, little one.

Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          If this is indeed the will of the
          Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle
earth stand at his side.

                    SAM
              (unseen)
          Here!

A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush!

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me.

                    ELROND
          No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to
          separate you...even when he is summoned
          to a secret council and you are not.

Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush!

                    MERRY
          Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to
          send us home tied up in a sack to stop
          us.

                    PIPPIN
          Anyway...you need people of intelligence
          on this sort of
          mission...quest...thing...

                    MERRY
          Well, that rules you out, Pip.

ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP

                    ELROND

          Nine companions ... so be it.

          You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"

          Great.   Where are we going?

INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN

Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold
and bright.

                    BILBO
          My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

                    FRODO
          It's so light!

                    BILBO
          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on
the Chain around his neck.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (entranced)
          Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo
          moves toward him.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I should very much like to hold it again,
          one last time. Bilbo reaches forward,
          eyes locked on the ring.

CONTINUED:


Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Oh!

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
              (sad)
          I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you,
          my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry
          this burden. I'm sorry for everything.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their
left.

                    GANDALF (V.O.)
          We must hold to his course west of the
          misty Mountains for forty days. If our
          luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still
          be open to us. From there, our road
          turns east, to Mordor.

                    PIPPIN
          Thanks.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf....

                    GIMLI
          If anyone were to ask for my opinion,
          which I note they have not, I would say
          we are taking the long way round.
          Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of
          Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a
          royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks
          that is a bad idea.

                    GANDALF
          No, Gimli. I would not take the road
          through Moria unless I had no other
          choice.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

                    SAM
          What is that?

                    GIMLI
          Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.

                    BOROMIR

          little cover

there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at
Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark
shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is
heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the
south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.

                    GANDALF
              (worried)
          Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is
          being watched.

Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing
towards a high mountain pass.

The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring
falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the
snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches
Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     ARAGORN
          Boromir?

                    BOROMIR
          It is a strange fate that we should
          suffer so much fear and doubt over so
          small a thing...such a little thing.

                    ARAGORN

Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum

above them. Frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! The Fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
LEGOLAS pulls Gandalf to safety. Aragorn shields Frodo and
Sam as snow piles around them. Within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. Boromir
and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled
out Shivering and Fearful.

                    BOROMIR
              (urgent)
          We must get off the mountain! Make for
          the gap of Rohan and take the West road
          to my city.

                    ARAGORN
          The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to
          Isengard.

                    GIMLI
          We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us
          go under it. Let us go through the mines
          of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on
          his face.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
          Moria. You fear to go into those mines,
          don't you? The dwarves delved too
          greedily and too deep.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You know what they awoke in, the darkness
          of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.

                    GANDALF
          Let the ringbearer decide.

CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily
upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's
arms.

                      GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Frodo?

Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.

                    FRODO
          We will go through the mines. Gandalf
          slowly nods.

                      GANDALF
          So be it.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark
lake...directly below great looming cliffs.

                    GIMLI
              (in awe)
          The walls of Moria!

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and
greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between
the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of
luminous silver running through the stone.

                     GANDALF
          Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and
          moonlight.

A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow
Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing
ancient letters and symbols.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          It reads, "The door of Durin, Lord of
          Moria. Speak, friend, and enter."

                    MERRY
          What do you suppose that means?

                    GANDALF
              (confident)
          It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
          speak the password and the doors will
          open.

Gandalf raises his arms...

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
              (incanting)
          Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, Frodo
shivers... and the door stands fast!

                                                         LATER:

GANDALF CONTINUES...

Mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. Sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as Aragorn un-
saddles Bill the pony. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to Bill
the Pony.

                    ARAGORN
              (whispering)
          Mines are no place for a Pony, even one
          so brave as Bill.

                       SAM
          Bye, Bill.

                    ARAGORN
          Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he
          knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on
          the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE
          ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the
          darkness.

                    SAM
          Goodbye, Bill.

SPLASH! Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Black Rippling rings slowly fan out. Pippin is about to
throw another stone, but Aragorn grabs his arm.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             86.
CONTINUED:


                    ARAGORN
              (ominous)
          Do not disturb the water.

Aragorn watches anxiously as the Ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with Boromir.

Aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. Gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside Frodo. Close on: Frodo peers at
the Elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    FRODO
              (quietly)
          It's a riddle...

Gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
              (explaining)
          Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the
          Elvish for friend?

                    GANDALF
          Oh...mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness,
something in the water stirs....

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria...a
Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

                    GIMLI
          So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          This, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, Balin...and they call this a
          Mine...
              (snorting)
          A mine!

A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf    Skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           87.
CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR
              (grimly)
          This is no mine...it's a tomb!

                    GIMLI
              (in horror)
          Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a
          crude arrow out of a skeleton.

                     LEGOLAS
          Goblins!

The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the
Entrance.

                    BOROMIR
          We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should
          never have come here.

EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

                    GANDALF
          Into the mines!

                     BOROMIR
          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT

With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy
Glow across the old wizards face.

                    GANDALF
              (ominous)
          We now have but one choice...we must face
          the long dark of Moria. Be on your
          guard...there are older and fouler things
          than the Orcs in the deep places of the
          world.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. NEW CHAMBER, MORIA -- NIGHT

WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above
deep mine workings.

                    GANDALF
          Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to
          the other side. Let us hope that our
          presence will go unnoticed.

INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN -- NIGHT

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK -- NIGHT

The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into
dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.

                    GANDALF
          I have no memory of this place.

LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf
sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of
him. He appears to be in some kind of trance.

CLOSE ON: FRODO

He turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind
them.

                    PIPPIN
          Are we lost?

                    MERRY
          No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh,
          Gandalf's thinking.

                    PIPPIN
          Merry!

                    MERRY
          What?

                    PIPPIN
          I'm hungry.

Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the
darkness. Frodo is nervous...he approaches Gandalf.

                    FRO DO
              (whispers)
          There's something down there.

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          It's Gollum.

                    FRODO
          Gollum!

                    GANDALF
          He's been following us for three days.

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

                    FRODO
              (disbelieving)
          He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?

                    GANDALF
          Escaped...or was set loose. And now the
          Ring has drawn him here...he will never
          be rid of his need for it. He hates and
          loves the ring, as he hates and loves
          himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.
          Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before
          the ring came to him, before it drove him
          mad.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is
large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

                    FRODO
             (grim)
         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

                   GANDALF
         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

                   FRODO
         I wish the ring had never come to me...I
         wish none of this had happened.

                   GANDALF
         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points
         at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship
         scramble to their feet.

                   MERRY
             (relieved)
         He's remembered!

                   GANDALF
         No, but the air doesn't smell so foul
         down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc,
         always follow your nose!
             (laughs)
         Ye s...

                                                               91.



INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

                    GALADRIEL
          Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf
          taps his staff...for a brief moment a
          light

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

                    GANDALF
          Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city
          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

                    SAM
          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

                    GANDALF
          Gimli!!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

                    GIMLI
          No...no...oh, no!

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.

            "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of
            Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had
            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

                      LEGOLAS
                (urgent whisper to Argorn)
            We must move on, we cannot linger.

                      GANDALF
                (reading)
            "They have taken the Bridge and the
            second hall: we have barred the
            gates...but cannot hold them for
            long...the ground shakes...drums in the
            deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves
            in the dark. Will no- one save us? They
            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

                      GANDALF
                (angry)
            Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next
            time and rid us of your stupidity!

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths
below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of
Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts
nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

                       SAM
                (worried)
            Mr. Frodo!

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's
Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing
blade!

                     LEGOLAS
          Orcs !

                    ARAGORN
              (to the hobbits)
          Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir
catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

                    BOROMIR
          They have a cave troll!

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the
tomb.

                    GIMLI
              (yelling)
          Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in
          Moria who still draws breath!

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,
and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

                    SAM
          I think I'm getting the hang of this.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest
with his spear.

                     FRODO
          Aragorn!   Aragorn!

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip
and slammed against the wall.

                    ARAGORN
              (shocked yell)
          Frodo!!

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,
bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas
fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits
looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge
breath.

                    SAM
          He's alive!

                    FRODO
          I'm alright. I'm not hurt.

                    ARAGORN
          You should be dead. That spear would've
          skewered a wild boar!

                    GANDALF
          I think there's more to this hobbit than
          meets the eye.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll
Spear did not pierce the mithril."

                    GIMLI
          Mithril! You are full of surprises,
          Master Baggins.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!
Gandalf turns to the others.

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start
scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army
that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills
the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the
pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back
Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the
darkness.

                    BOROMIR
          What is this new devilry?

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the
hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

                    GANDALF
              (quietly)
          A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great
40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a
blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP
of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a
dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his
staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

                    GANDALF
          Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is
          near.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Do as I say; swords are no more use here.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up
Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,
spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:
Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

                    GIMLI
          Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes
          through the wall and spreads its vast
          wings.

              (yelling)
          Over the bridge! Fly!

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb
or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the
last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the
Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks
back in horror:

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)

          I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
          wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark
          fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and
draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow
bridge.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          Go back to the shadow! The BALROG slashes
          at Gandalf with its Sword of

the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of
white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge
breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away
into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the
great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:
in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As
the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow
motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's
knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to
hand on by his fingertips

wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls
are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the
trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

                    CELEBORN
          Eight there are, yet nine there were set
          out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is
          Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with

          fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope

          I have not the heart to tell you. For me,
          the grief is still too near. Boromir is
          sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.
Aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    BOROMIR
          I will find no rest here. I heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of Gondor, and she
          said to me: "Even now, there

          My father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          He looks to me to make things right...and
          I would do it, I would see the glory of
          Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it,
          Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                      GALADRIEL
            Even the wisest cannot tell for the
            mirror shows many things...things that
            were ..things that are...and some things
            that have not yet come to pass.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...

                                                          103.



CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    FRODO
              (joyous)
          Gandalf!

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision
shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    GALADRIEL
          I know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. It is the future,
          Frodo. It is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at
Galadriel.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          The fellowship is breaking. It has
          already begun. He will try to take the
          ring. You know of whom I speak. One by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    FRODO (V.O.)
          If you ask it of me, I will give you the
          One Ring.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         104.
CONTINUED:


                    GALADRIEL
          You offer it to me freely...I do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's
eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
          In place of the Dark Lord, you would have
          a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous as the
          Sea! Stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! Frodo takes a step away from
          Galadriel...

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    GALADRIEL (CONT'D)
              (gently)
          I pass the test.
              (laughs)
          I will diminish and go into the west and
          remain Galadriel. Frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    FRODO
          I cannot do this alone...

                    GALADRIEL
          You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. This task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

                    FRODO
          Then I know what I must do. It's
          just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel
          kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    GALADRIEL
          Even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                         105.



INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY

Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean
intelligence.

                    SARUMAN (V.O.)
              (smiles)
          They were Elves once. Taken by the Dark
          Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a
          ruined and terrible form of life. And
          now...perfected. My fighting Uruk-Hai.
          Whom do you serve?

                    LURTZ
              (gutteral rasp)
          Saruman.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg
guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-
HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy
ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared
on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200
fully armed URUK-HAI.

                    SARUMAN
          Hunt them down. Do not stop until they
          are found. You do not know pain. You do
          not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.
          Saruman turns to Lurtz.

                    SARUMAN (CONT'D)
              (coldly)
          One of the Halflings carries something of
          great value...bring him to me...alive and
          unspoiled...kill the others.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

                    GALADRIEL
          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            106.
CONTINUED:


As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    ARAGORN
              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            107.
CONTINUED:


Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    ARAGORN
          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          Mordor from the North.

                    GIMLI
              (gloomy)
          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    ARAGORN
          That is our Road...I suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          Master Dwarf.

                    GIMLI
              (indignant)
          Recover my...

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

                    LEGOLAS
          We should leave now.

                    ARAGORN
          No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    LEGOLAS
          It is not the Eastern shore that worries
          me.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          A shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. Something draws near, I can
          feel it.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           108.
CONTINUED:


Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.
Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at Gimli's feet...

                    MERRY
          Where's Frodo?

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

                    BOROMIR
              (quietly)
          None of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Let me help you. There are other ways,
          Frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    FRODO
          I know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     BOROMIR
          Warning?   Against what?

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    FRODO
          There is no other way.

                    BOROMIR
          I ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          If you would but lend me the ring...

                    FRODO
          No. . .

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

                    BOROMIR
          Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.

                     FRODO
              (wary)
          You are not yourself.

                    BOROMIR
          What chance do you think you have? They
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

Frodo turns to leave.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          You fool! It is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          It should be mine. Give it to me! Give
          me the ring.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    FRODO DISAPPEARS
          Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    BOROMIR
          I see your mind...you will take the ring
          to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to
          your death and the death of us all.

            Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings!
            Boromir stumbles and falls. His body
            shakes as if in the Throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      BOROMIR (CONT'D)
                (Disoriented)
            Frodo! Frodo! What have I done. Please,

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

                                          IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy
shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down
the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

                                                            111.



AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

                       ARAGORN
          Frodo?

                     FRODO
              (numb)
          It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves
          towards Frodo...

                    ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Where is the ring?

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the
movement.

                       FRODO
          Stay away!

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo...I swore to protect you.

                    FRODO
          Can you protect me from yourself?

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Would you destroy it?

                    ARAGORN
              (kneeling to Frodo)
          I would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of Mordor.

                    FRODO
          I know...Look after the others,
          especially Sam...he will not understand.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

                     ARAGORN
              (urgent)
          Go, Frodo!

Frodo hesitates.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (yells)
          Run! Run!!

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto
Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       SAM
          Mr. Frodo!

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
URUKS.

                     LURTZ
          Find the Halflings ... find the
          halflings!

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

          Frodo!

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    MERRY (CONT'D)
          Hide here, quick!

                       PIPPIN
          Come on...

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    PIPPIN (CONT'D)
          What's he doing?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

                    MERRY
              (softly)
          He's leaving.

                        PIPPIN
          No!

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at
his arm.

                        MERRY
          Pippin!

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards
the lake.

                    LEGOLAS
          The horn of Gondor!

                        ARAGORN
          Boromir!

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling
URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear
guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he
tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

                        BOROMIR
          Run!   Run!

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's
chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

                        MERRY & PIPPIN
          Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir!

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn
charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven
in two.

                    BOROMIR
              (painful gasp)
          They took the little ones...

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow
          of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
              (panicked)
          Frodo...where is Frodo?

                    ARAGORN
          I let Frodo go.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

                    BOROMIR
          Then you did what I could not.   I tried
          to take the ring from him.

                    ARAGORN
          The ring is beyond our reach now.

                    BOROMIR
          Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed
          you all.

                    ARAGORN
          No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You
          have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to
          bind Boromir's wound.

                    BOROMIR
          Leave it! It is over...the world of Men
          will fall and all will come to darkness
          and my city to ruin..Aragorn..

                    ARAGORN
          I do not know what strength is in my
          blood, but I swear to you... I will not
          let the White City fall, nor your people
          fail...

                    BOROMIR
          Our people...our people...

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's
fingers tighten around the hilt.

                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
          I would have followed you, my
          brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn
          lays Boromir down. He is dead.

                    ARAGORN
          Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends
          and Kisses Boromir's forehead.

                     ARAGORN (CONT'D)
           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        SAM
           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     FRODO (V.O.)
           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

                     GANDALF (V.O.)
           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

                     SAM
               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

                        FRODO
           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.

CONTINUED:


                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    SAM
          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

                    FRODO
          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       FRODO (CONT'D)
                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     SAM
          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

                    FRODO
              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LEGOLAS
          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
          You mean not to follow them...

                    ARAGORN
          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    GIMLI
          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    ARAGORN
          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

                       GIMLI
          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

                    FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    SAM
          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

                     FRODO
          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

                    FRODO (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're with me.

WIDE ON: THE TWO HOBBITS SETTING OFF TOWARD MORDOR.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        GOLLUM
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

CLOUD.

             It must be getting late.

                        FRODO
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        GOLLUM
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        GOLLUM
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                       SAM
            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY

WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the
wining, torturous path ... clambering through BRACKEN and
over JAGGED ROCKS.

                       GOLLUM
            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
            to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
            Shhh.

GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN ...opens before them . . .

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

                       PIPPIN
             I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       MERRY
             Only, you've never done a hard days work.

MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

                        GANDALF

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the
SIGHT before them . . .

                       GIMLI
             You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        PIPPIN
                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             The salted pork is particularly good.

                        GIMLI
                  (suddenly interested)
             Salted pork?

             Hobbits!

                     MERRY
           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .

                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light . . .

ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his
ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e PA LAN TIR !

            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN . . . troubled.

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING

WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPI; LONG TABLES

                       THEODEN
            Tonight we remember those who gave their
            blood to defend this country. Hail the
            victorious dead!

ANGLE ON: Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards
ARAGORN . . . As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet.

                       EOWYN

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

             You are both honourable men.

                        THEODEN
             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

                       T HE ODE N ( co nt' d)
             Don't listen to me - you are young, and
             tonight is for you.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.

ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the
TABLES . . . both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.

             Oh, you can search - up and down
             As many lands as can be found
             But you'll never find a beer so brown
             As the one we drink in our home town
             You can keep your fancy ales
             You can drink them by the flagon
             But the only brew, for the brave and true,
             Comes from the Green Dragon!

ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN
steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

          No news of Frodo?

                     GANDALF
          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

                     ARAGORN
               (gently)
          What does your heart tell you?

                     GANDALF
               (with a small smile)
          That Frodo is alive.
               (to himself)
          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

                     SME AGO L (c ont' d)
          No!

                  (hissed whisper)
             Shhh! Quiet!

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

             No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty
             Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -

           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

                      MERRY
           (whispers)
           What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF
on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.                    ,

                        GANDALF
             Fool of a Took!

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

                        MERRY
             Pippin!

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

                        PIPPIN

          Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN . . .

             If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
             must be ready for war!

THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

           those who did not come to ours?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                      THEODEN (cont'd)
           What do we owe Gondor?

                      ARAGORN

           No!

           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .

PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,
dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

             It's the tree.           ,
                  (hurrying after GANDALF)
             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                  (quietly)
             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

                         DENETHOR
                  (bitter)
             Perhaps you come to explain this?

             Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and
             me . . . he fell, defending us from many
             foes.

CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

                  (hurried whisper)
             Pippin!

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .

                        PIPPIN
             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!
                  (a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR)
             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

            in this fight. Send word to Theoden of
            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
           of Lordship.

                       GANDALF
                (stung)
           Authority is not given to you to deny the

                 (explosive)
            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial

          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape

self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR-
VERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE ... Directly in
FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES.

             The secret stairs . . . climb!

SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD . . . as if some
FORCE, other than his own will, is at work! He lurches
towards the BRIDGE . . . towards MINAS MORGUL!

                        SAM
             No, Mr Frodo!

             What's it doing?

                  (disorientated)
             They're calling me!

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,
as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS: A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of
BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD.

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against
their ears, as out of the CITY comes a RENDING SCREECH . . .
SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the
range of hearing. The terrible CRY ends, falling back through
a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD . . . across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL
- the WITCH KING - suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on
his FELL-BEAST!

                        GANDALF V/0
             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated
             the west through many ages . . . It is a
             hatred that flows from the depths of time,
             across the deeps of the Sea.

The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his
ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM - a shadow into shadow.

             Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to
             be done. Another opportunity for one of the
             Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand
on PIPPIN'S shoulder.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)

                      FARAMIR
            In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf -
            they are taking the road to the Morgul
            Vale.

                       GANDALF
                 (shocked realisation)
            . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF, deeply troubled.

                       PIPPIN
            What does that mean? What's wrong?

                        GANDALF
                 (urgent)
            Faramir . . . Tell me everything.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER ·
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM
            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
            fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE . . . he has reached a
SMALL LEDGE.

                      GOLLUM
           Come, Master.

CLOSE ON: FRODO tries to CLAMBER UP onto the LEDGE . . . as he
does, the RING slips out of his SHIRT and DANGLES in FULL
VIEW of GOLLUM!

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM rears back in shock . . . tenses like a CAT,
EYES WIDENING.

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
                  (dreamlike)
             Come to Smeagol.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He
doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING !

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS . . . closing in on the RING   ...

ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS
DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                        SAM
                  (alarmed yell)
             Mr Frodo!

STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM
pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

                       GOLLUM
             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with
their heavy pale lids.

           Master carries heavy burden . . . Smeagol
           knows . . . Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one
           cannot know. Smeagol look after Master.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his
ear:

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
                  (rasping whisper)
           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it
           in   his eye. Very soon he will ask you for
           it   - you will see . . . the Fat One will take
           it   from you.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looking at SAM . . . his hand strays to his
NECK, closing tight around the RING.

             I do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.

                        FARAMIR
             What would you have me do?

                       DENETHOR
             I will not yield the River and Pelennor
             unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.

                        FARAMIR
             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a
             Captain here who still has the courage to
             do his Lord's will?

CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.



                        FARAMIR
                  (quietly)
             You wish now that our places had been

                       FARAMIR
            Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do
            what I can in his stead.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - DAWN

AERIAL SHOT: . . . HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE
next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD
. .. Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over
the cliff.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S EYES flick open . . . GOLLUM spins around,
caught off guard . . .

             What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?

                        SMEAGOL
                  (prevaricating)
             Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so
             polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh
             yes, my Precious, very nice.

                        SAM
             Alright, alright - you just startled me is
             all.
                  (peering over the cliff's edge)

                  (sly)
             Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
             moving on.

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

          Faramir! Your father's will has turned to

          rashly!

                     FARAMIR
               (deadened)
          Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes . . . he calls after
him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.

                     GANDALF
          Your father loves you, Faramir!
               (quietly)

INT. TOWER HALL, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

FAST PUSH IN . . . to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                      DENETHOR
           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
             my Lord.

                        ROHAN MARSHALL (0.S.)
             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

                        DENETHOR
                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying - no

CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS . . .

LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE ...

                        LEGOLAS
                  (uneasy)
             The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;.

             They grow nervous in the shadow of the
             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS
             It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door
             under the mountain.

             That mountain is evil . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed
... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes
nervously . . .

STRAP.

                        EOWYN
             There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In
his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD ...

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

                        MERRY
             Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are

                        EOWYN
             To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

             I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could

As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers ...
At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to

             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

RIBBON of WATER .

             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in

          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

 ARAGORN                   (gentle)
             It is but a shadow and a thought that you

determined to go ALONE.

 ARAGORN              Not this time ... This time you must stay,

ANGLE ON: THEODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES of
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

 GAMLING           Lord Aragorn!

 ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.           Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

 GAMLING           He leaves because there is no hope.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN as he moves forward.

 THEODEN           He leaves because he must.

 GAMLING           Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
          armies of Mordor.

 THEODEN           No, we cannot . . .
               (surveying his frightened Men)
          But we will meet them in battle,

ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR . . .

 THEODEN                 (gentle)
           I have left instruction: the people are to
           follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
           seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
           defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ...
She speaks without emotion.

 EOWYN            What other duty would you have me do, my
           Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND . . .

 THEODEN                (quiet)
           Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
           not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . .

 GIMLI              What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?

 LEGOLAS              One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES. ' 
EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY 
ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER
WALL of ROCK towers . . .

 GIMLI                (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

 LEGOLAS                (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY. 
 ARAGORN           Brego!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.

LEGOLAS quickly follows . . . swallowed by the DARKNESS.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR. 
 GIMLI              Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

EXT. DUNHARROW ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

MOVE ... fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN 
ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his SIDE.

 THEODEN           We must ride light and swift. It's a long
          road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
          the end with the strength to fight.

ANGLE ON: MERRY . . . preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING . . . he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

 MERRY              All my friends have gone to battle. I would
             be ashamed to be left behind!

 THEODEN              It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.
             None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.

 MERRY              But . . . I want to fight!

 THEODEN              I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS. 
SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE! 
CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER . . .
Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is . . .

. . . EOWYN, disguised as a MAN!

 EOWYN                 (grimly)

 MERRY            My Lady!

GANDALF intercepts the BEAST, striking him with his STAFF ...

 GANDALF                   (urgency)
             This is no place for a Hobbit!

GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC
with EASE ... BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF
... PIPPIN instinctively slashes his SWORD at him.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns on PIPPIN, smiling despite himself.

AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of mountain-
stone . . . and in the SHADOWS at the base of the TOWERING ROCK
lies a TUNNEL.

FRODO reacts to the FOUL STENCH coming out of the BLACK HOLE.

 FRODO                   (exhausted)
             What is this place?

 GOLLUM              Master must go inside the tunnel.

 FRODO              Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL sensing his PLAN unravelling. Everything
depends on FRODO going inside the TUNNEL

 SMEAGOL              It's the only way.
                  (GOLLUM;- slyly)

 FRODO              It's sticky . . . What is it?

GOLLUM is nowhere to be seen ... only his voice echoes back
down the LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.

 GOLLUM O.S.              You will see . . . Oh, yes . . . You will see.

... SUDDENLY, as if the ground has given way beneath him, SAM
is slipping and sliding dangerously OUT OF CONTROL.

unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if froma distant-;,,
memory . . .

 GALADRIEL V/0            I give you the light of Earendil - our most
           beloved star. May it be a light for you in

CLOSE ON: FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him
. . . he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL - his GIFT from GALADRIEL -
he holds it aloft.

 FRODO                 (stronger)

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing
to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW
TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

slashes through the WEB ... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB
gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS::.. . . .

himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the
SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE . . .

             wouldn't hurt Master.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT. 
                        SMEAGOL (cont'd)
             Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
             was the Precious - the Precious made us to
             do it.

FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases
GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

             destroy it for both our sakes.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS
to the bottom of the RAVINE ...

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

LOW CLOUDS! 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI and PIPPIN watch as . . .
ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the
HIDEOUS GHOULS ... 
 KING OF THE DEAD             Release us.

 GIMLI                  (quietly)
            Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these
            lads - despite the fact, they're dead!

 KING OF THE DEAD             You gave us your word.

 ARAGORN             I hold your oath fulfilled . . . Go. Be at
            peace.

ANGLE ON: The ARMY OF THE DEAD slowly DISSOLVE INTO DUST, and

PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the
devastation ... his eyes full of SADNESS ... they suddenly
fix on something.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN running through the RUIN of the BATTLE . . .
towards a SMALL FIGURE slumped on the ground ...

 PIPPIN              Merry ...?

MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN ... HORROR and SHOCK erasing
all other memories from MERRY'S mind ... tears fall down
PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND . . .

                         PIPPIN (cont'd)
             Merry . . . it's me, it's Pippin . . .

TILT UP . . . to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and
SHAGRAT, arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG
is snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

 SHAGRAT              Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
             mine.

 GORBAG              It's going to the Great Eye, along with
             everything else . . .

ANGLE ON . . . FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED
down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

... The RING HAS GONE!

 SHAGRAT              I don't take orders from stinking Morgul
             rats!

GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST ...

 GORBAG                   (angry yell)

on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!

SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their
wits - he slays THREE ... YELLING:

 SAM                 (yelling . . . 1st URUK-HAI)             ·

 FRODO                 (despairing)

SAM pulls the RING from his pocket ...

                         SAM (cont'd)
             I thought I ' d lost you . . . so I took it -
             only for safe-keeping.

CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM amazed . . . his eyes drop to the

 FRODO              Give it to me.

SAM seems strangely reluctant . . . ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of

 SAM            Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

 SAM            We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.

ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of
FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there .

 FRODO            There are so many of them . . . So many.
           We'll never get through unseen.

THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE ... BARAD-DUR
. . . A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN ...

                      FRODO (cont'd)
               (terror)
           It's him - the Eye.

The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

 SAM              We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's
             nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL . . . seemingly
alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

 GANDALF              Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

 ARAGORN              If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried . . .

 GANDALF           It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

 GIMLI           Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

 GANDALF           Because ten thousand Ores now stand between
          Frodo and Mount Doom.

             I have sent him to his death.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly . . .

 ARAGORN              No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

 GANDALF              How?

 ARAGORN              Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

 EOMER              We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

 ARAGORN              Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
             his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
             upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
             moves .

 LEGOLAS              A diversion . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN . . .

 GANDALF                   (doubtful)
             Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
             take the bait!

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a

             be sowing the summer barley in the lower

 FRODO                   (weak whisper)
             No, Sam. I can't recall    the taste of food;
             nor the sound of water;     nor the touch of
             grass . . . I'm naked in   the dark.
                  (rising panic)
             There's no veil between    me and the wheel of
             fire. I can see it with    my waking eyes.

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS - EARLY MORNING 
LYRICAL MUSIC OVER ... 
A COLD WINTER'S MORNING ... Out of the FOG rattles a SMALL
COVERED WAGON; GANDALF is at the REINS.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN are waiting on PONIES
for the WAGON . . . all are wearing their GREY ELVEN ROBES.

 FRODO V/0            Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
           end - that each of us must come and go in
           the telling. His part in this tale was now
           over. There would be no more journeys for
           Bilbo. Save one.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF arrives in his CART . . .

 DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WEST FARTHING - DAY 
WIDE ON: The WAGON trundles along at a SEDATE PACE.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY
PONY. 
 BILBO O.S.                 (frail)
           Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

 FRODO O.S.            To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
           accorded you a special honour. A place on
           the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

INT. WAGON - DAY 
CLOSE ON: FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON . . . his ARM around
his UNCLE BILBO.

BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING . . . his head
slumped.

CONTINUED: 

BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN . . . with effort he raises his head


 BILBO                   (frail)
             Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
             ring of mine ... the one I gave you?

 FRODO                   (quietly)
             Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.

 BILBO                   (frail)
             Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
             one last time.                                   ·

BILBO nods back to sleep ... FRODO rests his head against
him.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE GREY HAVENS - DUSK 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, walking arm-in-arm with BILBO through a
beautiful ELVEN BOAT-HOUSE ... GANDALF follows with MERRY,
PIPPIN and SAM.

CLOSE ON: As BILBO looks up, he is STUNG by the BEAUTY before
hm . . .
 i

 BILBO              Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never·seen
             before.

TRACKING: Passing under a beautiful ELVEN ARCHWAY . . .

. . . to reveal a WHITE SHIP, ready to depart from a WHITE
STONE DOCK. 
ANGLE ON: ELROND, CELEBORN and GALADRIEL are waiting for
them.

The SETTING SUN slowly dropping behind the SEA ... visible
between the HEADLANDS of a beautiful INLET.

CONTINUED: 

The lighting is beautiful . . . S U N streams through the sails,
casting an ethereal glow on THE GROUP as they walk onto the
DOCK. 
BILBO bows in acknowledgement to ELROND, CELEBORN and
GALADRIEL, who return his GREETING.

 GALADRIEL              The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
             time has come for the Dominion of Men.

 ELROND                   (ELVISH: with subtitles)
             I Aear can ven na mar.

             T he Sea calls us ho me.


ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH
YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER . . . He sets off down the PATH TOWARD
his HOSTS . . .

 BILBO              I think I'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND . . .

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up . . . GALADRIEL is watching him. She
SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT . . .

GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN - who are all
looking TEARFUL.

 GANDALF              Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

CONTINUED: (2) 

CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

 SAM                 (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

 FRODO                 (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

 SAM                 (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

 FRODO            The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the
departing SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already
preparing to leave.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. NO.3 BAGSHOT ROW - MORNING 
ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house . . .

A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

 SAM             Elanor!

He hugs his daughter . . .

 FRODO V/0             My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

 SAM             Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged
with a little SADNESS . . .

SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT . . .
the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.

 FADE TO BLACK.                                    Final Revision - October, 2003 151.

                           [TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]



                         [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains 
                         as voices drift in from the background.]
 
                         
                                     GANDALF
                         You cannot pass!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder 
                         of the Flame of Anor!
 
                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain 
                         side.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark 
                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] 
                         YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh!

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains 
                         him.]
 
                                     BOROMIR
                         No! No!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         Fly, you fools!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into 
                         the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
 
                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and 
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     SAM
                         What is it, Mr. Frodo?

                                     FRODO
                         Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
 
                         
                         [Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky 
                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we dont want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place were trying to get to. 
                         Its just where we cant get. Lets 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.
 
                                     FRODO
                         He didnt mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Its getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         What food have we got left?

                                     SAM
                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
                         but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, 
                         does it Sam?
 
                         [Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously 
                         towards Mordor.]

                         Those rain clouds might.

                         [They continue trekking through difficult 
                         terrain, often huddling underneath their 
                         cloaks.]
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks around] This looks strangely 
                         familiar.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Exasperated] Its because weve been 
                         here before! Were going in circles.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant 
                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         Were not alone.
 
                                     [NIGHTTIME
                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         The thieves! The thieves! The filthy 
                         little thieves! Where is it? Where isss 
                         it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. 
                         [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse 
                         them! We hates them! Its ours, it is... 
                         and we wantssss it!
 
                         [Gollum reaches out his hand towards 
                         the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring 
                         up, grab hold of Gollums arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. Gollums cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around Sams neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen 
                         it before, havent you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or Ill cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors 
                         going to hear this racket! Lets just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     SAM
                         Its no more than you deserve!

                                     FRODO
                         Maybe he does deserve to die, but now 
                         that I see him, I do pity him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Begging] We be nice to them if they 
                         be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears 
                         to do what you wants. We swears.
 
                                     FRODO
                         Theres no promise you can make that 
                         I can trust.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We swears to serve the master of the 
                         preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.

                         The Ring is treacherous. It will hold 
                         you to your word.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.

                         I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, 
                         frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] 
                         Get down! I said, down!
 
                         [Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum 
                         tries to get away from him. He crashes 
                         onto the ground, choking.]
 
                                     FRODO

                         Hes trying to trick us! We let him 
                         go hell throttle us in our sleep!
 
                         
                         [Gollum lies panting and holding his 
                         throat. He backs away, frightened, as 
                         Frodo approaches him.]
 
                                     FRODO

                         [nods again] Yes...

                         [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope 
                         noose off Gollums neck. Gollum seems 
                         surprised and relieved.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         You will lead us to the Black Gate.
 
                         
                         [Gollum scrambles off in the direction 
                         of Morannon and the hobbits follow in 
                         his wake.]
 


                         [A band of Uruk-hai marches across the 
                         plain, with two hobbits bound to the 
                         backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries 
                         to call to Merry, who is unconscious 
                         with a gash on his right brow.]

                         struggles to reach his Elven brooch 
                         with his teeth. He then tears it off 
                         his cloak and drops it onto the ground.

                         remains unbroken and visible on the

                         and ear pressed to the ground, listening

                         up.] They must have caught our scent. 
                         Hurry! [He runs off.]

                         what bare rock can tell. [Runs after 
                         his companions.]

                         Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick

                         huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now 
                         has the strength to stand against the 
                         armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand 
                         against the might of Sauron and Saruman 
                         and the union of the two towers?

                         Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule 
                         this Middle-earth.

                         The old world will burn in the fires 
                         of industry. The forests will fall. 
                         A new order will rise. We will drive 
                         the machine of war with the sword and 
                         the spear and the iron fists of the 
                         Orc. We have only to remove those who 
                         oppose us.

                         Trees! Climb a tree!

                         [Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up 
                         a tree each.]
 
                                     MERRY
                         [Looks around and then sighs in relief.] 
                         He's gone.
 
                         [Suddenly, Merry is pulled by his legs 
                         and falls to the ground. Grishnákh leans 
                         over him with his menacing blade. Merry 
                         tries to kick him off but to no avail.]

                         [Pippin looks down in horror but as 
                         he turns his head, he spots a pair of 
                         gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the 
                         tree hes clinging to. The tree starts 
                         to move and groan.]

                         Argh!!

                         [Pippin loses his grip in fright and 
                         grabs at the air futilely as he falls. 
                         The tree catches him before he hits 
                         the ground.]

                         [Suddenly he senses something behind 
                         him and as he looks up, the tree stomps 
                         and squashes him onto the forest floor.]

                         [Merry tries to run away but is scooped 
                         by the tree.]

                         slowly through the forest.]

                         Side? I am on nobodys side because 
                         nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody 
                         cares for the woods anymore.

                         Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. 
                         Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens 
                         his hold on the hobbits and squeezes 
                         them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] 
                         They come with fire, they come with 
                         axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, 
                         burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse 
                         them!

                         [Treebeard drops them on the ground 
                         and the hobbits look up at the White 
                         Wizard.]
 


                         [Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach 
                         the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor 
                         is now closer.]

                         you.
 
                         [Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks 
                         past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]

                         Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting 
                         a wide berth between him and Sam.]

                         swamp!

                         will take you on safe paths through 
                         the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go 
                         quickly.
 
                         [Gollum looks back and gestures for 
                         the hobbits to follow.]

                         I found it, I did. The way through the 
                         marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't 
                         know it. They go round for miles and 
                         miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick 
                         as shadows we must be.

                         miles as far as the eye can see. The 
                         hobbits and Gollum appear as little 
                         specks. As the three pick their way 
                         gingerly though the marshes, they see 
                         faces floating in the water, still, 
                         rotting and pale, and flickering flames 
                         on the swamps.]

                         and orcses. A great battle long ago. 
                         [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead 
                         Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. 
                         This way. Dont follow the lights.

                         the dead ones and light little candles 
                         of their own.

                         in Elven armour. He stares at it intently, 
                         until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo 
                         falls face-down into the water.]

                         [Frodo is in the water and sees many 
                         faces of the dead, no longer still but 
                         screaming and grasping, their rotten 
                         robes and hair flowing about their gruesome 
                         faces. Their hands are reaching for 
                         him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind. 
                         Frodo sputters and gasps for air as 
                         Gollum pulls him out of the water.]

                         his hand and stroking it, mesmerized.

                         quickly puts the Ring back inside his 
                         shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching 
                         away from him, stroking the centre of

                         cry, the Balrog falls from the peak

                         the rock underneath him gives way and 
                         he falls.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sam, no!

                                     SAM
                         Argh!!

                         [Frodo goes after Sam.]

                         Master!

                         [Two Easterling soldiers see streams 
                         of dust coming down the cliff made by 
                         Sam and Frodo. They move away from the 
                         troop to investigate. Frodo reaches 
                         Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the 
                         Easterlings move closer and closer, 
                         Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself 
                         and Sam. The soldiers are now directly 
                         in front of Sam, but their eyes see 
                         nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer 
                         from underneath the cloak. The soldiers 
                         soon leave and after a moment, Frodo 
                         throws back the cloak and pulls Sam 
                         out.]

                         I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these 
                         Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

                         catch you! Dont take it to him! He 
                         wants the preciousss. Always hes looking 
                         for it! And the preciousss is wanting 
                         to go back to him. But we mustnt let 
                         him have it.

                         another way. More secret. A dark way.

                         Are you saying theres another way into 
                         Mordor?

                         Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, 
                         and then a tunnel.
                          [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate 
                         closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm 
                         and burying his face in his cloak.]

                         Mr. Frodo, no.

                                     FRODO
                         Hes been true to his word.

                                     SAM
                         [Whispers] No!

                                     FRODO
                         Lead the way, Sméagol.

                         Good Sméagol always helps.

                         [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares 
                         after him in disbelief.]
 
                         [On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes 
                         into view.]

                         Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
                         There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, 
                         whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans 
                         hold over King Théoden is now very strong.

                         [Théoden just sits and stares ahead, 
                         his eyes clouded and unseeing.]

                         Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] 
                         Will you do nothing?

                         [At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the 
                         dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his 
                         hand. Gríma appears at the door.]

                         Oh, he he must have died sometime in 
                         the night. What a tragedy for the king 
                         to lose his only son and heir.
 
                         [He sits on the bed and puts a hand 
                         on Éowyns shoulder.]

                         I understand his passing is hard to 
                         accept, especially now that your brother 
                         has deserted you.

                         to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who 
                         knows what you have spoken to the darkness. 
                         In bitter watches of the night, when 
                         all your life seems to shrink, the walls 
                         of your bower closing in about you, 
                         like a hutch to trammel some wild thing 
                         in.

                         down to her throat.]

                         So fair, so cold, like a morning of 
                         pale spring still clinging to winter's 
                         chill.

                         she looks away into the distance. A 
                         flag comes off its pole and is carried 
                         by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming 
                         towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the 
                         entrance to Edoras, the flag floats 
                         down to land near him. Edoras is silent 
                         and somber. Everyone is dressed in black 
                         and staring at the newcomers in wary 
                         silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall 
                         and sees a lady in white standing on 
                         the steps. He looks around at more somber 
                         people.]

                         but the lady has disappeared. The company 
                         climbs up the stairs to the hall and 
                         is met by guards.]

                         for the others to surrender their weapons. 
                         Aragon hands over his sword and knives. 
                         Legolas gives a little twirl to his 
                         knives before handing them over to the 
                         guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]

                         Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You 
                         would not part an old man from his walking

                         gestures that they follow him into the 
                         hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink 
                         and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas 
                         arm.]

                         towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in

                         and appearance, haha that theyre often 
                         mistaken for Dwarf men.

                         I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was 
                         a dream, Arwen, nothing more.

                         and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while 
                         the latter is half-dragged by the warg. 
                         In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off 
                         and he rips the Evenstar pendant from 
                         Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn

                         his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.

                         himself and is dragged closer and closer 
                         to the edge of a cliff at great speed.

                         He fell...

                         [Éowyn is shaken and raises teary eyes 
                         to Théoden. The latter looks down and 
                         then walks away, confirming her unasked 
                         question.]

                         Bar the gate, and set a watch on the 
                         surround.

                         What of those who cannot fight, my lord? 
                         The women and children?

                         the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's 
                         arm would have grown long indeed if 
                         he thinks he can reach us here.

                         Helms Deep has one weakness. Its outer 
                         wall is solid rock but for a small culvert 
                         at its base which is little more than 
                         a drain.
 
                         [Camera turns to Gríma and Saruman at 
                         Orthanc. Saruman is pouring some dark 
                         dry substances into a vessel. Gríma 
                         is holding a lit candle in his hand.]

                         How? How can fire undo stone? What kind 
                         of device could bring down the wall?
 
                         
                         [As he steps closer to the vessel, Saruman 
                         takes hold of Grímas hand and pushes 
                         the candle away from the vessel firmly.]
 
                         
                                     SARUMAN
                         If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep 
                         will fall.
 
                         [He walks away towards the balcony.]

                         [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, 
                         it would take a number beyond reckoning, 
                         thousands to storm the keep.
 
                                     SARUMAN
                         Tens of thousands.

                                     GRÍMA
                         But, my lord, there is no such force.
 
                         
                         [Both of them came onto the balcony 
                         of the tower. Gríma suddenly sees and 
                         hears the enormous armies laid out below 
                         in neat rows and is astounded and awed.

                         candle aloft as he gapes at the vast 
                         army below. A horn is sounded, announcing 
                         the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer 
                         is heard from the army. Saruman raises 
                         a hand.]
 
                                     SARUMAN
                         A new power is rising. Its victory is 
                         at hand!

                         with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms 
                         Deep! Leave none alive!

                         balcony over the incredible size of 
                         Sarumans army, past Uruk-hai, spears, 
                         and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The 
                         camera focuses back on Saruman who then 
                         raises his hands in the air]

                         Uruk-hai army began their march to Helms

                         these days.

                         walk in my woods. But now he has a mind 
                         of metal and wheels. He no longer cares 
                         for growing things.

                         heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up 
                         of Galadriel] The quest will claim his 
                         life. You know this. You have foreseen 
                         it. It is the risk we all took.

                         In the gathering dark, the will of the 
                         Ring grows strong. It works hard now 
                         to find its way back into the hands 
                         of men.

                         an army. Easterlings and Southrons are 
                         passing through the Black Gate.

                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp

                         his men to shoot. At the last moment,

                         No, not its business. Leave us alone!
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy 
                         little hobbitses. They stole it from 
                         us.
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         [Whimpers] No... No!

                                     FARAMIR
                         What did they steal?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] 
                         Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth 
                         and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
 


                         [Back in their holding area, Sam and 
                         Frodo are alone.]
 
                                     SAM
                         We have to get out of here. You go. 
                         Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, 
                         Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. 
                         Disappear.
 
                                     FRODO
                         I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried 
                         to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings 
                         taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell 
                         find me. Hell see.
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo...

                         [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is 
                         the answer to all the riddles. Here 
                         in the wild I have you. Two halflings 
                         and a host of men at my call. The Ring 
                         of power within my grasp.
 
                         [Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's 
                         neck with the tip of his sword.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
                         to show his quality.
 
                         [Frodo is backed up fearfully against 
                         the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo 
                         falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs 
                         the Ring in his hand and jerks himself 
                         away.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

                                     SAM
                         Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you 
                         understand? Hes got to destroy it. 
                         Thats where were going. Into Mordor. 
                         To the mountain of fire.
 
                         [Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then 
                         Damrod enters.]
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Osgiliath is under attack. They call 
                         for reinforcements.
 
                                     SAM
                         Please. Its such a burden. Will you 
                         not help him?
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Captain?

                                     FARAMIR
                         Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to 
                         Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
 
                         [Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



                         [Aragorn is riding towards Helms Deep. 
                         On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai 
                         army marching with great speed. He quickly 
                         makes haste towards Helms Deep and 
                         soon sees the refuge.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, 
                         Brego, mellon nîn. (Well done, Brego, 
                         my friend)
 
                         [He rides into Helms Deep to the amazement 
                         of all.]

                         Hes alive!

                                     GIMLI
                         [Pushing his way through the crowd.] 
                         Where is he? Where is he? Get out of 
                         the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees 
                         Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the 
                         canniest and the most reckless man I 
                         ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless 
                         you, laddie!
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Gimli, where is the king?

                         [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn 
                         makes his way in, he runs into Legolas 
                         who stands waiting.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         Le ab-dollen. (Youre late.) [They smile. 
                         Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns 
                         wounds.] You look terrible.
 
                         [To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and 
                         smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas 
                         takes Aragorns hand and gives the Evenstar 
                         pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar 
                         and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]
 
                         
                                     ARAGORN

                         [Éowyn looks on and smiles even as tears 
                         fill her eyes.]
 
                         [Aragorn is in the keep, conferring 
                         with Théoden]

                         A great host, you say?

                                     ARAGORN

                         How many?

                                     ARAGORN
                         Ten thousand strong at least.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Ten thousand?!

                                     ARAGORN
                         It is an army bred for a single purpose: 
                         to destroy the world of men. They will 
                         be here by nightfall.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
 
                         
                         [Along the passage behind the Deeping 
                         Wall.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         [to Gamling] I want every man and strong 
                         lad able to bear arms to be ready for 
                         battle by nightfall.
 
                         [Gamling nods and goes off. Théoden 
                         stands at the gate of Helms Deep, speaking 
                         to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         We will cover the causeway and the gate 
                         from above. No army has ever breached 
                         the Deeping Wall or set foot inside 
                         the Hornburg.
 
                                     GIMLI
                         This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
                         These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick 
                         and their shields broad.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. 
                         I know how to defend my own keep.
 
                         
                         [Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a 
                         hand on Gimlis shoulder as he follows 
                         Aragorn and Théoden back in.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         They will break upon this fortress like 
                         water on rock. Sarumans hordes will 
                         pillage and burn, weve seen it before. 
                         Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. 
                         Within these walls, we will outlast 
                         them.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         They do not come to destroy Rohans 
                         crops or villages. They come to destroy 
                         its people. Down to the last child.
 
                         
                                     THÉODEN
                         [Draws close to Aragorn] What would 
                         you have me do? Look at my men. Their 
                         courage hangs by a thread. If this is 
                         to be our end, then I would have them 
                         make such an end as to be worthy of 
                         remembrance.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Send out riders, my lord. You must call 
                         for aid.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We 
                         are not so lucky in our friends as you. 
                         The old alliances are dead.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Gondor will answer.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold 
                         fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies 
                         closed in around us? Where was Gon 
                          No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.

                         caves.

                         We need more time to lay provisions 
                         for a siege, lord 

                         [Cutting him off] There is no time. 
                         War is upon us!

                         of carrion crows circle overhead.]

                         carrying Merry and Pippin. He comes 
                         to a clearing and stops.]

                         wars of men and wizards for a very long 
                         time. But now something is about to 
                         happen that has not happened for an

                         A gathering of what?

                         [Merry and Pippin turns round as they 
                         hear movement from the forest around 
                         them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard 
                         gathering.]

                         good. Many have come. Now we must decide 
                         if the Ents will go to war.

                         weapons are being distributed. Aragorn 
                         picks up a battered sword, looks at 
                         it and tosses it back.]

                         Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened. 
                         I can see it in their eyes. [The men 
                         around them fell silent. Legolas speaks 
                         to Aragorn.] Boe a hûn: neled herain

                         [The villagers are handed their weapons. 
                         An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed 
                         boy. Another stares at the axe that 
                         he is handed with frightened eyes. Another 
                         child wearing oversized chain mail takes 
                         up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside 
                         the main hall of the keep, his back 
                         to the entrance where a bright white 
                         light is streaming through.]

                         and the rider? Where is the horn that 
                         was blowing? They have passed like rain 
                         on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.

                         on the steps. He sees a young lad in 
                         armour holding a sword looking around 
                         nervously.]

                         Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men 
                         are saying that we will not live out 
                         the night. They say that it is hopeless..
 
                         
                         [Aragorn gives the battered sword a 
                         few swings.]

                         This is a good sword, Haleth, son of 
                         Háma.
 
                         [He hands the sword back to Haleth and 
                         leans close to him, putting a hand on

                         There is always hope.



                         [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his 
                         battle gear. His sword is handed to 
                         him as he reaches for it. He nods and 
                         accepts the sword from Legolas.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         We have trusted you this far. You have 
                         not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
                         wrong to despair.

                         Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing 
                         to forgive, Legolas.)
 
                         [They smile and clap one another on 
                         the shoulders. They look at Gimli as 
                         he walks up to them, struggling with 
                         his chain mail.]

                         lands with its length right to the floor.]

                         [Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles. 
                         Just then, a horn sounds in the background]

                         That is no Orc horn. [They run out to 
                         the battlements.]

                         are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers 
                         look upon them in wonderment and delight 
                         as they pass.]

                         I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. 
                         An alliance once existed between Elves 
                         and men. Long ago we fought and died 
                         together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, 
                         and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.

                         and closer. The women and children in 
                         the caves hear the sounds overhead and 
                         are frightened. Mothers draw their children

                         his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai

                         being carried away, kicking and struggling

                          THE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.]

                         With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai 
                         and looks down as his wound in seeming 
                         disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from 
                         behind him unnoticed and slices him 
                         on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he 
                         looks around him and sees his kin fallen 
                         among dead Uruk-hai.]

                         up the steps to Haldirs side and catches 
                         him and he collapses. Haldir's head 
                         rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. 
                         Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then 
                         with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and 
                         swings down to the ground, killing as 
                         he goes.]

                         a lance in his shoulder, blocked by 
                         his armour. Grimacing in pain, Théoden 
                         continues to stab at the Uruk until

                         on, little Shirelings. I always like 
                         going south. Somehow it feels like going

                         emerges in front of him. Frodo stares 
                         at the Nazgûl, fixated. Feeling the 
                         call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir 
                         watches the unfolding tableau from below. 
                         As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his 
                         finger and the Nazgûl flies closer and 
                         closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo 
                         over. Faramir releases an arrow and 
                         shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam 
                         roll down the stairs. As they come to 
                         a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam 
                         in a death grip, yells and points Sting 
                         at his throat, his eyes livid with madness 
                         and anger that someone would try to 
                         take the Ring away.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Aaarrgghh!!!

                                     SAM
                         [With tears running down his face] Its 
                         me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your 
                         Sam?
 
                         [The madness fades and recognition returns 
                         to Frodos eyes. He realises what he 
                         nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling 
                         backwards, he collapses against a wall 
                         and Sting falls to the ground with a 
                         clang. Sam gets up slowly.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Slowly and with despair] I cant do 
                         this, Sam.
 
                                     SAM
                         [Getting up slowly] I know. Its all 
                         wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be 
                         here. But we are. [He stands and leans 
                         against a wall, looking out into the 
                         distance.] Its like in the great stories, 
                         Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. 
                         Full of darkness and danger they were. 
                         And sometimes you didnt want to know 
                         the end. Because how could the end be 
                         happy? [Images of the riders winning 
                         the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helms 
                         Deep] How could the world go back to 
                         the way it was when so much bad had 
                         happened?

                         his sword with a victorious cry]

                         But in the end, its only a passing 
                         thing, this shadow. [The women and children

                         crying tears of relief.] Even darkness 
                         must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard

                         balcony, Saruman stumbles back into

                         it will shine out the clearer. Those 
                         were the stories that stayed with you. 
                         That meant something, even if you were 
                         too small to understand why. But I think, 
                         Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
                         Folk in those stories had lots of chances 
                         of turning back only they didnt. They 
                         kept going because they were holding 
                         on to something.
 
                                     FRODO
                         What are we holding on to, Sam?

                         Frodo. And its worth fighting for.

                         shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir

                         Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth 
                         is about to begin. All our hopes now 
                         lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere 
                         in the wilderness.

                         I wonder if people will ever say, lets 
                         hear about Frodo and the Ring. And 
                         theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite 
                         stories. Frodo was really courageous,

                          Samwise the Brave. I want to hear 
                         more about Sam.

           FADE IN ON:
                         
          THE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving.

          Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS --
          takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center
          of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork

          Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort.
                         
          MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children
          locked in a large empty room. They start leading them
          out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN:

          SHACKLED BOY. Unbuckling his pants.
                         
          The Man pales. Realizing the American understands what
          he was about to do, backing away, BEGGING IN PASHTUN:

          Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand
          and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And
          Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.
                         
          Omar lowers his arm. Goes upstairs, dragging his bear.

          Clay turns. Approaches the cell. Looks down into it...
          it's clear from Clay's face that it's SOMETHING HORRIFIC.

          A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK

          Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER

          Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as
          the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last

          A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching
          as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and
          forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler:

           You kill a friendly Afghan warlord,
           probably lose us the support of
           half the tribes in the region, and
           your alibi is "MAX?"

           There is no specific Max.

          Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him.
                         
                          WADE
           "Max" is catch-all for exactly
           what you've been accused of.

           We didn't kill those kids, Wade.
          Wade studies him. Finally:
                         
                          WADE
           I believe you.
                         
          Fennel sighs.
                         
                          FENNEL
           Stay here. We'll be back.
                         
          They watch Wade and Fennel leave. Now alone. SILENCE.
          After a bit, Pooch looks down. Under a little table...

           never even saw the guy, Clay-
                         
                          CLAY
           We heard his voice. Guy with a
           voice is a guy with a throat. And
           if he's got a throat...
                         
                          ROQUE
                          (IN DISBELIEF)
           We're hiding out in the parking
           lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You
           actually think we're in any position
           to take on some shadowy CIA super-
           spook?
                         
                          CLAY
                          ROQUE-
                         
                          ROQUE
           No, it's a stellar plan - we can
           use this as our base of ops!
           (gestures to the
                          PLAYGROUND)
           Pooch can run the motor pool out
           of the ball pit and Jensen can set
           up communications by the slide!
                         
          Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other...
                         
                          CLAY
           Go.
          Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the
          cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...
                         
          EXT. MOTEL SIX -- AFTERNOON
                         
          Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still
          between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:
                         
                          ROQUE
           I was there too. I remember. But
           he won. We lost.
                          (PAUSE)
           Maybe it's time for a new game.
           23.
                         
          With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at
          his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food...
                         
          INT. BUSTER'S BOOZE & BURGERS
                         
          Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky-
          tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor.
                         
          A YOUNG WOMAN enters - she's hot, feels familiar. Clay
          eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several GUYS.
                         
           PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE GUY
           Yabba Dabba Doo...
                         
          She catches Clay's eye. Rolls her eyes. Clay's paying
          more attention to his T-Bone than the girl. She slides
          up next to him. Her name's AISHA.
                         
                          AISHA
           Men.
                         
          Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women
          instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           How's the steak?
                         
                          CLAY
           Meaty.
                         
          She's still watching him. It's getting annoying.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Want a bite?
                          AISHA
           I don't eat red meat.
                         
                          CLAY
           Why not?
                         
                          AISHA
           Slows me down.
                         
                          CLAY
           Okay.
                         
          Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention,
          we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're
          not sure if Clay does.
           24.
                         
                          AISHA
           You got nice arms.
                         
                          CLAY
           (turning to her)
           I know you?
                         
                          AISHA
           Relax, slugger... I like arms.
           That's all.
                         
                          CLAY
           Do I not look relaxed?
                         
                          AISHA
           No.
                          (PAUSE)
           Think we can change that?
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
          INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL. - GOLD COAST MOTEL - LATER
                         
          Clay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out
          the sparse accommodations.
                         
                          AISHA
                          (DEADPAN)
           Wow, it's everything a girl could
           dream of. Got a bathroom?
                         
                          CLAY
           No, I specifically requested the
           only hotel room in the world that
           doesn't have a bathroom.
                          AISHA
           You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a
           "no" here?
                         
          Clay points to the bathroom.
                         
          INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - GOLD COAST - BEDROOM / BATHROOM
                         
          Aisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss.
                         
                          AISHA
           So what brings you to Florida?
                         
          Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his
          hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up.
           25.
                         
                          CLAY
           Convention.
                         
           AISHA (O.S.)
           Convention for what?
                         
          Shit. Clay looks around. Weakly:
                         
                          CLAY
           ...Air conditioners.
                         
          IN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror.
          Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity...
                         
                          AISHA
           They have whole conventions devoted
           to air conditioners?
                         
          IN THE BEDROOM
                         
                          CLAY
           You'd be surprised.
                         
          Aisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose.
                         
                          AISHA
           Bet I would. Where were we?
                         
          They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay.
                         
                          CLAY
           You were about to tell me how much
           you enjoy spending time at the dog
           track...
          Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...
                         
                          AISHA
           Saw me there did you?
                         
          Clay strokes her cheek...
                         
                          CLAY
           Uh-huh...
                         
                          AISHA
           Didn't see me at the McDonald's
           though...
                         
          Their lips, inches from touching...
           26.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           I have a proposition for you...
                         
          WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up
          and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his
          forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE.
          Both breathing hard. Staring at one another:
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           Just hear me out. I don't want to
           hurt you.
                         
                          CLAY
           You're not going to.
                         
                          AISHA
           Yes, I am.
                         
          He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY
          VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists
          SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES.
                         
          She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him.
          This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as
          the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors...
                         
          They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're
          GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE --
                         
          AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight
          against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME.
          Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM:
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           Room's on fire.
                          CLAY
           Noticed. What do you want?
                         
                          AISHA
           Your life. Back.
                         
          Clay spits blood and sucks air.
                         
                          CLAY
           You want to clarify that?
                         
                          AISHA
           Max. I can help you.
           27.
                         
          This clearly has effect on Clay - Substantial Effect.
          Clay stares up at Aisha. FLAMES ALL AROUND THEM...
                         
                          CLAY
           I'm listening.
                         
          EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL STREETS -- NIGHT
                         
          Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL.
                         
                          CLAY
           How'd you find me?
                         
                          AISHA
           It's not too tough if you know
           where to look. You guys aren't
           exactly subtle.
                         
          A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,
          as if to illustrate her point.
                         
                          CLAY
           How'd you know I was alive?
                         
                          AISHA
           Counted the number of teeth found
           in the safehouse debris in Karachi.
           Not nearly enough for five men.
                         
                          CLAY
           Who else knows?
                         
                          AISHA
           That you're alive? Just me.
                          CLAY
           So what's to stop me from putting
           a bullet in your head?
                         
                          AISHA
           You want Max and I can tell you
           how to get him.
                         
                          CLAY
           Max is up to something big, isn't
           he? Agency wouldn't have sent you
           otherwise.
                         
          She gives a little smile.
           28.
                         
                          AISHA
           Nice try, but I'm working alone
           here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't
           need your help. Ready for the
           important part?
                         
          Clay nods.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           There is a plane.
                         
                          CLAY
           Okay.
                         
                          AISHA
           This plane contains a truck.
                          CLAY
           Okay.
                         
                          AISHA
           This truck contains a cargo.
                         
                          CLAY
           Right.
                         
                          AISHA
           This cargo is very important.
                         
                          CLAY
           Is this a riddle?
                         
                          AISHA
                          (FORCED SMILE)
           This cargo belongs to Max. You
           steal the cargo, Max comes looking
           for it, you grab Max.
                         
                          CLAY
           What a brilliant plan, and oh, so
           simple too. What's the cargo?
                         
          Aisha just smiles.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Right. So you want me to steal
           some super secret cargo known only

           it comes straight from the poppy
           fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.

           He used you to kill Fadhil and
           take over his operation, that's
           right. What did you think you

           scientific genius. Granted his
           weight signaled that he had certain
           impulse control issues, but that's
           no reason to throw his fat ass out
           a fifty story window.

           What if it doesn't? What if we
           never get face to face with him.
           Are you gonna be able to live with
           that? Ever?
                         
          Clay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally:
                         
                          POOCH
           Hell, let's just say it out loud...
                          (PAUSE)
           We do this, we're declaring war on
           the Central Intelligence Agency.
                         
          Silence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner:
           50.
                         
                          COUGAR
           They started it.
                         
                          SMASH TO:
                         
          EXT. NEW ORLEANS -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY
                         
          SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between
          buildings, past the islands slamming into
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS
                         
          A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT-
          LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO.
                         
          A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles,
          surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine
          guns, frag grenades, body armor.
                         
          BY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends,
          talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman.
                         
                          FENNEL
           As of this moment, the truck is
           designated an extraterritorial
           zone of immunity. Under no
           circumstances whatsoever are you
           or your men to allow the package
           to leave the truck before it's
           secure in the compound - to do so
           would be considered an act of
           treason and punishable as such.
                         
                          LIDDY
           Understood and acknowledged, sir.
          As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...
                         
                          WADE
           Ten men ride with the package and
           another ten ride chase.
                         
          Ten rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van.

          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY
                         
          The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private
          airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR...
           51.
                         
          INT. TOWN CAR - SAME
                         
          Clay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by.
          Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck
          passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER...
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's
          ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the
          lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker.
                         
          INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Target is westbound. Heading for
           the bridge...
                         
          Clay fires up the Town Car and follows.
                         
          AERIAL -- LOOKING DOWN as the armored cars head towards
          the city. TILT UP to reveal the CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION --
          eight suspended lanes spanning the Mighty Mississippi...
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION
                         
          HIGH ANGLE -- Looking down at the bridge traffic. Sliding
          into frame, buckle-harnessed and very armed --
                         COUGAR
                         
          TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE
          SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL
          RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.
                         
          As the FIRST SWAT TRUCK reaches the center of the BRIDGE --
                         
           CLAY (O.S.)
           Take em'.
                         
          Cougar FIRES --
                         
          And everything begins happening very fast.
           52.
                         
          The SWAT TRUCK'S nearside front wheel EXPLODES, blown
          clear off the axle mount --
                         
          The wheel spins away, bounces wild, smashes a windshield --
                         
          INT. SWAT TRUCK -- FRONT CAB -- DAY

                          SWAT DRIVER
           Shit, I'm losing it!
                         
          The Truck SLEWS sideways -- PLOWS into a car! The Driver
          SLAMS the truck in reverse, FLOORS IT --
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY
          Cougar FIRES AGAIN -- the other front wheel DETONATES,
          and the truck's nose SLAMS down on the asphalt GRINDING
          SPARKS! Going nowhere fast...
                         
          THE CHASE VAN
                         
          Screeches to a hard stop behind. SECURITY CREW OUT --
          WEAPONS RAISED -- taking up DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. Ice
          cold professionals.

          EXT. TOWN CAR
                         
          Now at the entrance to the bridge. Roque smiles as he
          hefts an MGL-40 GRENADE LAUNCHER. FIRING...
                         
          BY THE CONVOY
                         
          THICK TEAR GAS EXPLODES in dark blues, billowing across
          traffic. SECURITY MEN CHOKE, lost in the SMOKE...
                         
                          WADE

          COUGAR pumps a round into the EMPTY CHASE VAN -- Armor-
          glass BLASTING APART, showering the roadway -- Fennel
          DIVES for cover, PANICKING -- Lifts the radio to his lips:
                         
                          FENNEL
           Code RED! We are under attack!
           Need Chopper Support right now!
                         
          ROQUE fires another TEAR GAS GRENADE into the melee --
          CIVILIANS running and screaming -- TOTAL PANDEMONIUM --
                         
           CONTROL (V.O.)
           Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!
                         
          As the CHASE VAN is BLOWN APART behind them! Fennel trying
          to orient through smoke and gas. Then, a NEW SOUND...
          DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...
                         
          The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous
          twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!
                         
          It bellies in low, the boarding ramp already lowering...
                         
          Wade crouch-runs to the SWAT TRUCK, HAMMERING the rear
                         DOORS --
                         
                          WADE
           Cavalry's here!
                         
          The doors BURST OPEN and the SWAT Team CRASH-ROLLS the
          precious CARGO CRATE towards the Chinook's boarding ramp --
                         
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           Move! Point cover! Go, go!
          INT./EXT. CHINOOK HELICOPTER -- DAY
                         
          SWAT Guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle
          the crate into the Chinook's WINDOWLESS HOLD. The ramp
          RISING as Fennel dives onboard as well...
                         
          BY THE CONVOY
                         
          Wade makes a "take off" sign to the Chinook pilot who
          flips him a salute as THE CHINOOK LIFTS INTO THE AIR...
                         
          The ramp closing. The team and cargo safely aboard...
           54.
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- UPPER SUPERSTRUCTURE
                         
          Passing Cougar's sniper-harness, which now HANGS EMPTY.
          Twisting in the wind.
                         
          As we hear the rotors fade into the distance...
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY
                         
          Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase
          van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles:
                         
           CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)
           This is Chopper Support--we are
           inbound your position, ETA five
           minutes! Hang in there!
          As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face
          and he stares up into the sky...
                         
          INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY
                         
          The SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They
          think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit
          door handle... He can't turn it.
                         
                          FENNEL
           What the hell? It's welded shut!

          INT. CHINOOK COCKPIT -- DAY
          We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in
          the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal --
                         
          It's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot. Both grinning as
          they hear the protestations from behind them...
                         
                          FADE TO:
                         
          EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EVENING
                         
          The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and
          crickets harmonize. Clay waits with Jensen and Roque.
          THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above...
           55.
                         
          INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING
                         
          Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and
          personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each
          other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather
          themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off.
                         
                          FENNEL
           We're down, okay! You go the second
           the ramp lowers! Hit them hard,

          EXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING
                         
          Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER
          HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE
          RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:
                         
                          AISHA
           Open the valve.
                         
          TIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open...

           These guys are about to get the
           surprise of their lives...
                         
          Cut off as a CLEAR LIQUID begins to rain down on them
          from the SPRINKLER SYSTEM...
                         
                          FENNEL (CONT'D)
           What the hell they trying to do,
           drown us?
                          SOLDIER 1
           Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!
                         
          Their EYES GO WIDE...
                         
          HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched
          soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the
          fumes...
                         
          CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple
          rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel
          blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless:
           56.
                         
                          FENNEL
           Eat the ground, or they blow your

           I don't think so.
                         
                          FENNEL
           First and only warning, Clay!
                         
          Clay calmly LIGHTS A CIGARETTE. TIGHT ON THE BURNING
          CHERRY: The soldiers, wide eyed...
                         
                          CLAY
           Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think
           about it.
          AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died.
                         
          GASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&K
          G36 assault rifle... Clay takes a long smooth drag.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Things'll kill you.
                         
          A beat... and then the fight just goes out of the SWAT
          Team. They DROP THEIR GUNS and RAISE THEIR HANDS...
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Good boys. Now, let's see what

          outside the Chinook. The others, going with him...
                         
          EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- NIGHT
                         
          The Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a

                          CLAY
           I say we hit Goliath headquarters.

                          CLAY

           does, we steal it and trade it for
           immunity.
                         
          Roque stares at him.
                         
                          ROQUE

                          CLAY

          He stalks away. Roque glowers. Heads the other direction.

          The Sergeant rises, and we follow him through the station
          towards the front doors. Moving faster and more nervously
          as the NOISE OUTSIDE GROWS. Finally stepping out into

          The street where a CROWD has gathered. Lookie-loos with
          camcorders. The Sergeant pushes through them to find
                         
          FENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD.
                         
          A SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America!

          The Company?
                         
                          MAX
          Won't give it to us willingly...
                          (THINKING)
          You get that six man team together
          like I asked?
                         
                          WADE
          Yeah.
                         
                          MAX
          Change of plans. Kill them.
                         
                          WADE
          Kill them?
                         
                          MAX
          Or fire them, whichever's easier.
                         
                          WADE
          Honestly? Firing them.
                         
                          MAX
          Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy.
          What I need- wait. Did you give
          them intel on Clay's people?
                         
                          WADE
          Well, yeah.
                         
                          MAX
          Aaaand we're back to killing them.
                         
                          WADE
                          (ANNOYED)
          Fine, I'll kill them - what are we
          doing instead?
           71.
                         
                          MAX
           Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are
           you related to them?
                         
                          WADE
           Actually, one of them, yes.
                         
                          MAX
           By blood?
                         
                          WADE
           (he's had it)
           A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill
           him, what are we doing?
                         
                          MAX
           It's not what we're doing, it's
           what Clay is going to do for us...
                         
                          WADE
           And that is?
                         
                          MAX
                          (GRINNING)

          INT. OUTSIDE HOUSTON - BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOF - NIGHT
                         
          Clay. Sitting on his bed. Shirt off. Going over
          schematics - GOLIATH WORLD HEADQUARTERS. A KNOCK on Clay's
          door. He gets up, checks the eye hole. Opens it. AISHA.
                         
                          CLAY
           I was just going over the plan.
                         
          She looks at him. Sexual. Predatory.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           You want to go over the plan?
                         
          She steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Let's go over the plan...

                          AISHA
           So, what really happened to you in
           Afghanistan?
                         
          Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo...
          And shakes his head.
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SOFTLY)
           That's not for you.
                         
          She traces her fingers over it...
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Why do you want Max dead?
                         
          Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.
                         
                          AISHA
           He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
                         
                          CLAY
           No.
                         
          A beat. She looks at him.
                         
                          AISHA
           When you tell me about Afghanistan?
           I'll tell you about Max.
                         
                          CLAY
           Fine. It's hot. There's lots of
           sand. Your turn.
                         
          Aisha smiles at this. Shaking her head.
                         
                          AISHA
           Why were you alone when I found
           you?
                         
          That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.
                         
                          CLAY
           The guys got sick of it.
                         
                          AISHA
           Sick of what?

                          CLAY
           Of hearing about Max. Of hearing
           me say we had to do something when
           there wasn't anything to do. They
           wanted to be around their families.
           Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a
           wife and daughters.
                         
                          AISHA
           And he hasn't told them he is alive?
                         
                          CLAY
           Would you? The people you loved
           the most, would you put them in
           that kind of danger?
          Aisha, side-stepping the question:
                         
                          AISHA
           So Roque has no one.
                         
                          CLAY
           He's got me.
                         
                          AISHA
           And you have...
                         
                          CLAY
           Enough hate to get us both through
           the day. He stuck with me when no
           one else would. And I ain't the
           easiest guy to stick with.
                         
          Aisha studies him.
                          AISHA
           If you two really fought, he would
           kill you, I think.
                         
                          CLAY
           You think.
                         
                          AISHA
           I'm almost sure of it.
                         
                          CLAY
           Why?

                          AISHA
           Because you care what happens to
           the others. You wouldn't put them
           at risk to save yourself.
                         
                          CLAY
           And you think that's a weakness.
                         
                          AISHA
           I know it is. Law of the jungle.
                         
                          CLAY
           We're not in the jungle.
                         
          She looks at him.
                          AISHA

          Idling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel,
          Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and
          Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Well, that's just great.
                         
          That's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in
          the family truckster.
                         
                          POOCH

           Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
                         
          Pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his
          arms. Clay sighs. Looks over to Roque. A beat. Then:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Sorry I hit you.
                         
                          POOCH
           Good. Roque?
                         
          A longer beat...
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Roque?

                          ROQUE
           Sorry I threatened to cut your
           head off.
                         
                          POOCH
           Verrrry good. Now don't you two
           feel better?

          Jensen enters the reception area singing. Moves to the
          receptionist desk. A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST answering phones.

          The Receptionist looks up. She's on the phone, distracted:
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Excuse me one moment-

          The Receptionist looks up at Jensen, not particularly
          amused. She points towards the elevators.

          They comply. Jensen looks down at them. Smiles. Then
          slowly turns looking out the FLOOR TO CEILING GLASS

           When we first went over in 2001,
           Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted
           to do the yellow ribbon thing,

           the stores had been cleaned out.

           No doubt. And Tina's four at the
           time, and what she can't understand
           is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow.
           So Jolene sings her the song, right?
           To show her where the idea comes
           from. And when she's all done,
           Tina, four years old, looks my
           wife dead in her eye and says
           "that's the dumbest song I ever

           Wade. Port of New York, for their
           big final awesome stand against
           the forces of evil where they die.
                         
          He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps...
                         
          INT. HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          ...where the TWO INDIAN SCIENTISTS wait. The Indian THUG

                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           Do you have the money?
                         
                          MAX
           Jesus, always with the money! So
           impersonal! How are you? How
           have you been?
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           I recently attended the funeral of
           my best friend who you had thrown
           out a window. How have you been?
                         
                          MAX
           Can't complain. I'm thinking of
           getting satellite radio in my car...
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           I think you're a freak. Too much
           Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy
           football.
                         
          Max smiles and spreads his arms...
                         
                          MAX
           Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           We have your ordinance. You have
           twenty four hours to get the money.
                         
          Max looks over to Wade.
                         
                          MAX
           Time to go make a withdrawal...
           92.
                         
          As he turns back to the plane...
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           New change of plan. You stay.
                         
                          MAX
           I've got to go get your money.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           He'll get your money. You stay
           right here.
                         
          A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist.
                         
                          MAX
           God, are you short.
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           Twenty three hours, fifty nine
           minutes...
                         
          Max looks at Wade.
                         
                          MAX
           Get it done.
                         
          Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade
          boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time,
          looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things
          as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           How much do you weigh? Seriously.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           I do not think you are funny.
                         
                          MAX
           Where the hell is my bomb?
                         
          The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up. A
          HEAVY TARPED BOMB LIKE PACKAGE strapped to the back.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           You do not get it till I get the
           money.
                         
                          MAX
           For a guy who's all about
           transcending materialism, you talk
           about money so much!
           93.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will
           cut your mouth out of your face.
                         
                          MAX
           Fine...
                         
          INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE -- NIGHT
                         
          After business hours. A WINDOW SMASHES. Roque climbs
          inside. Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others,
          who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table.
                         
                          POOCH
           She burned us, Clay.

           The whole op is compromised-
                         
                          CLAY
           I know.

                          (RE: JENSEN)
           Cougar?
          Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN
          DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.
                         
                          JENSEN
           What's that for?
                         
          Cougar SHOVES IT BETWEEN JENSEN'S TEETH as an answer...
                         
                          POOCH
           So we split up again. Right?
                         
          Clay doesn't respond...
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Right?

                          ROQUE
           Pooch...
                         
                          POOCH
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows,
           Max knows! It's over!
                         
          His words echo through the room.
                         
          JENSEN SCREAMS through the dowel as Cougar sews him up...
                         
          This is how low they've sunk. Clay finally looks up.
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SLOWLY)
           Okay. We split up. Some of us
           should go international. I'll do
           that if nobody else wants to-
                         
                          ROQUE
           So we just run again?
                         
          Clay turns to him.
                         
                          CLAY
           There's nothing else we can do...
                         
          Silence. Then:
                         
                          ROQUE
           There's something we can do.
                         
          A beat.
                          CLAY
           Excuse me?
                         
                          ROQUE
           Three years is enough. If there's
           a drive at that port that we can
           use to get clear-
                         
                          CLAY
           What part of "he knows we're coming
           for it" do you not get? They're
           gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec
           is gonna waiting for us...
           95.
                         
                          ROQUE
           So figure out a way around them;
           you're good at that shit, Clay!
                         
          He turns, addressing all of them:
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           We run now, we're gonna be running
           forever. This is our one chance
           to get our lives back...
                          (TO CLAY)
           To steal them back. And I'm
           prepared to do anything to any one
           to make that happen.
                         
          He looks Clay dead in the eye.
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           Never play a longshot, you're never
           gonna win.
                         
          A long beat. Clay, not breaking his look with Roque:
                         
                          CLAY
           Pooch, what's the minimum time to
           scout the patrols, get an accurate
           head count on-site at the Port?
                         
                          POOCH
           48 hours, but Aisha knows that-
                         
                          CLAY
           So we hit them in twelve.
                         
          Roque smiles. Pooch blinks.
                          POOCH
           Twelve hours from now? You mean--
           you want us to go in blind?
                         
                          ROQUE
           Last thing they'll expect...
                         
                          POOCH
           Yeah, cause it's dumb.
                         
                          CLAY
           Jensen's already got the layout,
           and Cougar can spot on site. Right?
                         
          Cougar nods. He's in.
           96.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)

                          JENSEN
           Yeah, cause gettin' shot is
           awesome, I'm totally up for doing
           it again...
                         
          He gives a weak thumbs-up. In. All that's left is
                         
                          CLAY
           Pooch?
                         
          Pooch, struggling with the decision...
                         
                          POOCH
           Last time we went in blind on an

                          CLAY
           So?
                         
          A beat. Pooch looks up.
                         
                          POOCH
           So let's go get it back.

          ESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN
          HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile
          from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque.
          THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS:
                         
          GOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing
          for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a
          bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb
          sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.
                         
                          CLAY
           You ready?
                         
          A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks
          back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have
          something on his mind.

           I'm ready.
                         
          Clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat
          towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY
          LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it...
                         
          INT. SECURITY LAUNCH - NEW YORK HARBOR
                         
          Clay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind.
          Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from
          behind with TASERS, then strip off their outer gear,
          revealing PAR-SEC UNIFORMS.

          EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - PERIMETER STREET
                         
          A block off the front gate. A blacked out Chevy van.
          Pooch sits behind the wheel. Ready for exfiltration.
                         
                          POOCH

          EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - SHORELINE
                         
          A drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it.
          We PUSH IN HARD, reveal a small opening cut in the cage
          it -- THROUGH the opening -- FIRE 70 FEET into the pipe --
          through a second opening -- down another long pipe and
                         
          SLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal.
          Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards.

          Clay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending

          A huge shipping room with hundreds of crates. We push in
          on a LARGE WOODEN CRATE. The side of the crate STARTS TO
          FLEX... and SPLINTERS as Jensen breaks out of his box!
                         
                          JENSEN

          leaning up against the door.

          Jensen opens the door. Clay and Roque quickly move in.

          Jensen nods. Knows how important his job is. Heading
          for a ladder. Clay and Roque begin to set CHARGES

           Roque.
                         
          Head wounds bleed bad. The crowbar caused a mother of a

           After the truck. I got tired of

          Clay stares at him.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)

           gonna get to be soldiers again?
           (leans down; softly)
           We lost the moment we went off
           mission. This is just the logical
           conclusion of that playing out.
           You didn't want to hear it.

           You just wanted your revenge.
           Your face-to-face with the big bad
           wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's
           the way of the world...
                         
          Roque straightens back up, shaking his head:
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           Guys like us don't beat guys like
           him.
                         
          In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE
          SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following,
          a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:
                          CLAY
           Kill me now... Maybe you live
           through this.
                         
                          WADE
           Oh, we're not gonna kill you.
           Someone's gotta get away with the
           cash. Your crew? I'm definitely
           wasting them. But you?
                         
          He nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH
          CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile...
                         
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           You're about to steal a billion

           Intelligence Agency.
                         
          Clay stares at daggers at both of them.
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           It's for our replacement nuke.
           When a billion goes missing, people
           tend to ask who took it.
                          (CHUCKLING)
           Max really does love to frame you...
                         
          Several Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay:
                         
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           Take him away. Drop him in Newark.
                          (TO ROQUE)
           I'll see you at Turner Airfield.
           104.
                         
          The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing
          him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque:
                         
                          ROQUE
           Wait.
                         
          They stop. Roque looks at his old friend.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry it had to end this way.
                         
          Clay stares back at him.
                         
                          CLAY
           You're going to die very badly.
          The guards hustle Clay out the door...
                         
          EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY
                         
          PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards
          the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
          up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
          opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:
                         
          They've lost.

           Roque.
                         
          Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.
                         
          Gone.
          The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
          WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
          end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.
                         
                          LEAD GUARD
           On your knees.
                         
          Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in
          BOTH LEGS!
                         
          Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and
          Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch
          looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:
                         
                          POOCH
           Get on with it...
           105.
                         
          The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding
          his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...
                         
                          LEAD GUARD
           That's a nice hat.
                         
          He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
          the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
          again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
          colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.
                         
          The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.
          Levelling the rifle at his head...
                         
           LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)
           Don't really care of there's a
           hole in it. One wash, good as...
                          (NOTICING)
           What are you smiling at?
                         
          Cougar's nods past him...
                         
          As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...
                         
                         AISHA
                         
          As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP
          BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament
          style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
          FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...
                         
          And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as
                         
          THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight
          for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...
          KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...
                         
          INT. TRUCK (MOVING)
                         
          The Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by

          EXT. BY THE WAREHOUSE
                         
          Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with
          legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
           106.
                         
          WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him
          cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
          VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
          rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
          fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
           Can you stand?
                         
                          POOCH
           I've been shot in both legs, what
           kind of dumbass question is that?
                         
                          JENSEN
           Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're
           not the only one who's been shot
           recently, you know!
                         
          He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...
                         
          AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of
          AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when
                         
          A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
          hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
          figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
          Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's
                         
          CLAY. They stare at each other...
                         
          Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill my father?
          Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
                         
                          JENSEN
           Clay?
                         
                          CLAY
           Kind of in the middle of something

                          JENSEN
           There was no drive and Roque's
           gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and
           Pooch could bleed out-
                         
          Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill him?
                         
          Clay, about to respond when:
           COUGAR (O.S.)
           I did.
                         
          They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.
                         
                          COUGAR (CONT'D)
           He asked us. It was mercy. But
           you're his family, so I understand.
                         
          And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.
                         
          SURRENDERING...
                         
                          COUGAR (CONT'D)
           But only me.
                         
          Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
          equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
          Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...
                         
          A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...
                         
          In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.
                         
          The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
          BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
          his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!
                         
          Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
          face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.
                         
                          AISHA
           Wear it. Remember him.
           108.
                         
          Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Okay, excellent, very tribal--We
           need to go.
                         
          As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new
          Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar
          hightail it back to where Pooch lies.
                         
                          CLAY

           someone forgot to tell me...
                         
          Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.
          Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.
          PUSH IN on Clay's face for:
                         
                          CLAY
           Let's go.
                         
          And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,
          Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full
          on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...
                         
          They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the

          Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go.
          Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road.
                         
                         FINALLY:

           Way it always goes.
                         
          Clay looks at him.

                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Guess we should just head home.

           have homes.
                         
          Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows
          what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel:
                         
                          COUGAR
           Where to, Colonel?

           I'm out.
                         
          He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.

          INT. HANGAR -- NIGHT
          Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Yoo-hoo! Wade!
           (a'la the Warriors)
           Come out and plaaaayyy-
                         
          The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as
          Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
                          (INTO RADIO)
           Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...
                         
          He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived
          in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...
           112.
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
           I think I just found our way out
           of here...
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP
          of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...
                         
          Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...
                         
          Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!
                         
          IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING
          KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...
                          ROQUE
           Gotta admit, I always wondered how
           this would play out.
                         
                          CLAY
           Aisha thinks you kill me.
                         
                          ROQUE
           It's a distinct possibility...
                         
          They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           You don't have a knife?
                         
                          CLAY
           Don't need one.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Bit of as longshot for you...
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SMILING)
           No. It's not.
                         
          Roque LUNGES AT HIM...
                         
          But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
          into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...
                         
          For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But
          not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.
           113.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Now I really am gonna cut your
           head off...
                         
          He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...
                         
          The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see
          Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
          in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.
                         
          Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...
                         
          Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
          it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
          TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
          Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!
                         
          Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:
                         
          Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
          which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
          manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
          apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
          him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
          WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!
                         
          And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.
                         
          Which seems to make Clay happy.
                         
          So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.
                         
          Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...
          TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT
          EAGLE levelled at Clay.
                         
                          CLAY
                          SHIT-
                         
          The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's
          abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING
          OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the
          brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep
          Clay from rolling off the hood...
           114.
                         
                         THE PLANE
                         
          TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's
          final run to get up to speed...
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course
          when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay
          turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Rifle...
                         
          Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...
          VISUALIZE THIS --
                         
          AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
                         
          AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed
          at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.
                         
          And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.
          The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.
                         
          She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
          lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.
                         
          She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the
          LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS
          Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,
          causing the bike to
                         
          CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...
                         
          ...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE
          of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.
                         
          Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the
          escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...
                         
          ...as Roque dies very badly.
                         
          WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA
          DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.
           115.
                         
          ON THE GROUND
                         
          Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares
          at the sight before him. Only one word for it.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Outstanding.
                         
          Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Not to rain on everyone's we killed
           all the bad guys parade, but we
           should probably get gone - legless
           Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up
           for us in the Hangar.
           (off Pooch's look)
           It's a cool name-
                         
          From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL
          PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and
          Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:
                         
                          CLAY

           We good?
                         
          TIGHT ON CLAY realizing who he's talking to.
                          CLAY
           Not by a longshot. You're not
           having a real great day, Max.

                          CLAY
           Just a voice on the phone.
                         
                          MAX
           Where's Wade?
                         
                          CLAY
           Working on the engines.
           116.
                         
          A beat as it hits Max.
                         
                          MAX
           Clay.

           It's Colonel.
                         
          In the distance, SIRENS.
                         
                          MAX
           Colonel, yes. Well done.
                         
                          CLAY
           Thank you.
                          MAX
           I understand you've always wanted
           to meet face to face. I'm sure
           that could be arranged...
                         
          A beat. Then:
                         
                          CLAY
           I don't think the guys you're about
           to stiff for a billion dollars are
           going to allow that to happen.
           (looks to the others)
           We win. You lose. Goodbye.
                         
          He snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire.
          Turns to the others.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Lear jet?

          Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar start for the Hangar. Clay
          looks to Aisha. A moment between them.
                         
                          AISHA
           I wanted to find and punish those
           responsible for my father's death.
           Max, his men, everyone.
                         
                          CLAY
           That why you slept with me?
           117.
                         
                          AISHA
           That and the cardio.
                         
          Clay smiles.
                         
                          CLAY
           You coming?
                         
          A beat. She nods.
                         
                          AISHA
           I'm coming.
                         
                          CLAY
           Good cause there's no way I could
           walk it...
          She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they
          head for the Hangar. Together.
                         
          INT. NORTH INDIA -- HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          Max lowers the phone. Looking stunned. The Short
          Scientist has run out of patience.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTEST
           Time is up, Stretch.
                         
          Max looks at the Short Scientist.
                         
                          MAX
           Stretch. That's a good one.
                         
          But he doesn't look like he's very amused.
                          SHORT SCIENTEST
           Because you are so much taller
           than I.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, no, I get it...
                         
          Momentary pause. The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly
          gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.
          Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)

          WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound

          A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
          heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
          Opens it and looks out to see...
                         
          Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
                         
          She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies
                         
          A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
          steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
          Her breath hitches in her chest.
                         
          A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
                         
          And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
          knows what it means.
                         
          Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.
                         
          Someday.

                         In these days of wars and rumors of 
                         wars - haven't you ever dreamed of a 
                         place where there was peace and security, 
                         where living was not a struggle but 
                         a lasting delight?
                                      
                         The second page reads:
                                     
                         Of course you have. So has every man 
                         since Time began. Always the same dream. 
                         Sometimes he calls it Utopia - sometimes 
                         the Fountain of Youth - sometimes merely 
                         "that little chicken farm."

                         One man had such a dream and saw it 
                         come true. He was Robert Conway - England's 
                         "Man of the East" - soldier, diplomat, 
                         public hero

                         Our story starts in the war-torn Chinese 
                         city of Baskul, where Robert Conway 
                         has been sent to evacuate ninety white 
                         people before they are butchered in 
                         a local revolution.

                         The field is aflare with floodlights 
                         - on one side is an office building 
                         - on the other are hangars. The whole 
                         field is filled with Chinese refugees 
                         running around wildly. An Army transport 
                         is in front of the office building, 
                         motors going.

                         Showing in the distance, probably several 
                         miles away, the effect of a burning 
                         city, which is Baskul. Over the shot 
                         we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire. 
                         In the f.g., we see the silhouetted 
                         figures of Chinese running away from 
                         Baskul and toward the Camera, their 
                         personal packs on their backs.

                         Toward office building. Conway comes 
                         out of the building, followed by a small 
                         group of white people with frightened 
                         faces. They have to fight their way 
                         through a horde of milling Chinese.

                         As Conway and group finally reach the 
                         plane where Conway forces the white 
                         people in. In this he is aided by his 
                         brother, George, a young and vigorous 
                         Englishman. The pilot sticks his head 
                         out of the cockpit.

                         PILOT
                                     
                         Conway, we can't take more than seven!
 
                                                              
                         Conway pulls a passenger out and gives 
                         the pilot a signal to start.

                         All right. I'm sorry. There will be 
                         another plane in a minute. All right 
                         - go on.

                         Motors roar, and the plane starts to 
                         move, scattering those of the Chinese 
                         who were unfortunately too close to 
                         the ship. Conway and George rush back 
                         into the office building.

                         all lift their panicky faces to Conway 
                         and George as they enter. A barrage 
                         of questions are flung at them.

                         Are there any more planes? Do you think 
                         the bandits will come here? Please take 
                         my wife next, Mr. Conway!

                         in Chinese, ordering them out. Some

                         When they have all left, Conway opens

                         waits for the fuel to spill on the ground,

                         Conway emerges, followed by Gloria, 
                         and an American, Barnard. CAMERA FOLLOWS 
                         THEM to the ship just as the pilot, 
                         Fenner, is climbing down from cockpit.

                         George is pushing off Chinese.

                         When Conway and others approach, George 
                         helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway 
                         faces the mob, punching at those who 
                         try to wedge their way forward. Finally 
                         one of them manages to get his foot 
                         on the step, and Conway pushes him violently.

                         Who staggers back and falls, sprawling. 
                         As he hits the ground, he yells:

                         We meet Alexander P. Lovett.

                         Conway looks his surprise and lifts 
                         him off the ground.

                         Glaring off toward Conway, picks up 
                         a board and starts toward Conway.

                         George emerges in time to see the Chinese 
                         lift the board and about to clout Conway 
                         on the head. George moves quickly, puts 
                         out his left hand, wards off the blow 
                         and with his right he punches the Chinese, 
                         who reels out of the scene.
                                      
                         GEORGE

                         A shadowy figure materializes in the 
                         cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind. 
                         He shoves Fenner aside and takes his 
                         place.

                         Conway pushes George up and starts to 
                         mount himself. He looks off - and what 
                         he sees startles him.

                         Of what Conway sees. Several trucks 
                         loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms 
                         - come tearing up the road - come to 
                         a stop. Some fire toward plane - others 
                         are setting up machine guns. Droves 
                         of refugees scramble to cover.

                         Already present are Barnard, an American; 
                         Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, 
                         whom we saw dressed as a Chinese. Conway 
                         slams the door shut - looks off - then 
                         cries:

                         ahead, Fenner!
                                      
                         They all fall on their faces.

                         As the plane swings around - taxies 
                         crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied 
                         by gunfire of the bandits.

                         Conway rises and glances out of a window, 
                         warily.

                         There are murmurs of "Yes" - "I'm all

                         37. FULL SHOT
                                     
                         All is silent for a moment. Conway is 
                         writing on a small pad - which he rests 
                         on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging 
                         through a closet - rear of the cabin.
 
                                                              
                         38. MED. SHOT - GEORGE AND CONWAY
                                     
                         Conway still writes, undisturbed. George 
                         reaches into the closet and emerges 
                         with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights 
                         up.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (holds up bottle)
                                     
                         Hello! Look what I found!
                                     
                         He crosses to Conway.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Just what I needed too.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (looks up - smiling)
                                     
                         You?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. 
                         Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent 
                         to Shanghai just to take you back to 
                         England. You know what it means.
                                      
                         (hands him cup)
                                     
                         Here you are. Don't bother about those 
                         cables now. I want you to drink with 
                         me.
                                      
                         (holds his cup up)
                                     
                         Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway 
                         - England's new Foreign Secretary.
 
                                                              
                         Conway watches him, amused. George gulps 
                         down his drink.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (after a slight hesitation - downing 
                         his drink)
                                      
                         Hurray!
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!
 
                                                              
                         (dreamily)
                                     
                         People are going to point to me and 
                         say, "There goes George Conway - brother 
                         of the Foreign Secretary."
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
 
                                                              
                         Conway takes the bottle from him and 
                         pours himself a second drink.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         That's why they're sending for you, 
                         Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, 
                         it was bound to happen. They need you.
 
                                                              
                         Conway, with a poured drink in hand, 
                         laughs.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         All right, you can laugh if you want 
                         to. But who else can they get? Who else 
                         is there in all of England half the 
                         fighter, half the diplomat, who
                                      
                         ? 482 ?
                                     
                         has half your knowledge of the foreign 
                         situation? They can't stop you now, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         Conway moodily pours himself a third. 
                         He downs the drink as we
                                      
                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY
                                     
                         We find Conway, asleep in his seat, 
                         his head on his hands. George approaches 
                         and tenderly spreads a jacket over his 
                         shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.
 
                                                              
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (drunkenly)
                                     
                         Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report 
                         out yet?
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes, Bob.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Did you say we saved ninety white people?
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Hurray for us. Did you say that we left 
                         ten thousand natives down there to be 
                         annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. 
                         They don't count.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better try to get some sleep, 
                         Bob.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. 
                         Can't you just see me, Freshie, with 
                         all those other shrewd, little Foreign 
                         Secretaries?
                                      
                         (confidentially - screws up face)
                                     
                         You see, the trick is to see who can 
                         out-talk the other. Everybody wants 
                         something for nothing, and if you can't 
                         get it with smooth talk, you send an 
                         army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. 
                         I'm not going to have an army. I'm going 
                         to disband mine. I'm going to sink my 
                         battleships - I'm going to destroy every 
                         piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy 
                         approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen 
                         - what can we do for you?" So then the 
                         poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. 
                         And what will they think, Freshie? They'll 
                         think to themselves - "Something's wrong 
                         here. We've been duped. This is not 
                         according to form. These people seem 
                         to be quite friendly, and why should 
                         we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down 
                         their arms. You see how simple the whole 
                         thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked 
                         right in the pants
                                      
                         (pause - drily)
                                     
                         and I'll be slapped straight into the 
                         nearest insane asylum.
                                      
                         He starts to pour himself another drink.
 
                                                              
                         ? 483 ?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         You'd better not drink any more, Bob. 
                         You're not talking sense.
                                      
                         Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles 
                         cynically.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Don't worry, George. Nothing's going 
                         to happen. I'll fall right into line. 
                         I'll be the good little boy that everybody 
                         wants me to be. I'll be the best little 
                         Foreign Secretary we ever had, just 
                         because I haven't the nerve to be anything 
                         else.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Do try to sleep, Bob.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, 
                         sleep.
                                      
                         He grunts and squirms. George tucks 
                         him in.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         Did you ever notice the sunrise in China, 
                         George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful.
 
                                                              
                         He gets settled. George relaxes and, 
                         leaning back, shuts his eyes.
                                      
                         40. LONG SHOT OF CABIN
                                     
                         It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA 
                         MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches 
                         the glass panel leading to the cockpit. 
                         The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner 
                         we see a strange, Mongolian face - with 
                         sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays 
                         across his mouth.

                         Flying at high speed against a moonlit 
                         sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes, 
                         a mere speck, over the horizon.

                         The morning sun peeks over a mountain 
                         top. From the same direction, as if 
                         arriving with the sun, the ship looms 
                         up, and comes roaring toward us.

                         All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets 
                         on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens 
                         his eyes - and stretches. As he does 
                         so, he sees that Lovett is awake.

                         Good morning, Lovey.

                         I didn't care for 'sister' last night, 
                         and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. 
                         My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.

                         I see.

                         I see.

                         Well, it's a good morning, anyway.

                         I'm never conversational before I coffee.
 
                                                              
                         Barnard glances out of the window, looks 
                         around outside thoughtfully.
                                      
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? 
                         Say, we're supposed to be travelling 
                         east, aren't we?
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         Why, of course. Yes.
                                     
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling 
                         west.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         That's ridiculous.
                                     
                         BARNARD
                                     
                         Is it?

                         It certainly is.

                         Any child. I don't care where the child 
                         is - in the air, on the earth, or in 
                         the sea. If you face the rising sun, 
                         your right hand is the north, and your 
                         left hand is the south

                         I always get it twisted because I'm 
                         left-handed.

                         Well, you just reverse it. Your left

                         What difference does it make what 'hand' 
                         you are? The north is the north!

                         in the east, and we're going away from 
                         it.

                         - locates the sun in back of him - smiles 
                         - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending 
                         glance over at Barnard - then suddenly 
                         his face clouds - the whole thing dawns 
                         on him.

                         Of course. That's what I told them last 
                         night. You can't expect a man to sail 
                         around in the dark.[5]

                         He crosses to panel leading to cockpit, 
                         CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. When he gets there 
                         he knocks on the window.

                         George knocks again. From the cockpit 
                         side - the small shade suddenly snaps 
                         up - and George finds himself staring 
                         into the face of the mysterious pilot. 
                         He takes an instinctive step backward. 
                         The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE 
                         WIDENS as George keeps backing up until 
                         he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway 
                         and shakes his shoulder.
                                      
                         GEORGE

                         Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens 
                         his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout 
                         it, George speaks.
                                      
                         GEORGE

                         Fenner in the cockpit!
                                      
                         Conway looks at him, glances off toward 
                         the others, and back at George.

                         The bloke up there looks a Chinese, 
                         or a Mongolian, or something.

                         This interests Conway and he looks out 
                         of the window.

                         Then rising, he crosses to cockpit. 
                         The others watch him expectantly.

                         Conway pounds on the panel. The face 
                         of the pilot appears in sight. Conway 
                         tries to ask him something in Chinese. 
                         The pilot glares at them for a second, 
                         then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively 
                         they back away.

                         Gloria is apparently indifferent to 
                         their predicament. As Barnard watches 
                         her, a little bitter smile plays around 
                         her mouth.

                         startled.

                         running toward the plane.

                         looks off and is startled by something 
                         he sees. George follows his gaze, and 
                         a bewildered expression comes into his 
                         eyes, too.

                         natives have surrounded the plane and 
                         are closing in.

                         Conway and George both instinctively 
                         wheel around toward the opposite side. 
                         But from that direction too, a horde 
                         of natives dash toward them. Conway 
                         hesitates a second, and like a flash 
                         springs for the door. But he stops again, 
                         as he opens the door.

                         Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted,

                         teeth clenched, struggles against a 
                         desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly.

                         finally unable to control himself, emits 
                         a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his

                         Deathly silence. Gloria has her hands 
                         to her ears, rocking in pain. Suddenly 
                         her voice rents the air.

                         She jumps up and moves about frantically.

                         Take us down! I can't stand this pain 
                         any longer! Let me out of here I say!

                         She runs to one of the ship's doors 
                         and pounds on it with her fist, then 
                         tries to shove it open. A blast of frigid 
                         air throws her back. George and Conway 
                         manage to pry her off and pull her away. 
                         Sobbing pitifully, she lets Conway steer 
                         her back to her seat, where she bundles 
                         up in torturous pain. For a moment nothing 
                         is heard but her stifled moans.

                         Unexpectedly the cockpit panel opens, 
                         and the pilot tosses something out in 
                         Gloria's direction.

                         in despair. All of a sudden there is 
                         a loud, sputtering noise from the outside. 
                         They all react - listen for a moment 
                         - until the noise dies completely. Now 
                         nothing is heard - not even the motor.

                         they hand around cushions and blankets.

                         The occupants brace themselves for the 
                         jolt. The ship hits and bounces several 
                         times and finally stops. Its nose seems 
                         to bury itself in the ground. The people 
                         are lifted high into the air where they 
                         remain, suspended for a few seconds, 
                         terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by 
                         grinding, crackling sounds, the ship 
                         flops back and falls on its side. For 
                         a moment there is stark silence - while 
                         the people do not stir. A look of relief 
                         spreads over their faces.

                         "Okay - yeah - I think so." Meanwhile, 
                         Conway has opened the door. A swirling 
                         mass of snow greets them, so that they 
                         have to force their way out.

                         from the plane in the blinding snow. 
                         George quickly runs around to the other 
                         side. Conway crosses to the cockpit, 
                         and clambers aboard.

                         (sniffing)

                         Conway hops up beside the pilot. George 
                         follows suit.

                         Here George, take the gun. Hold the 
                         lights. I'm going to search him before 
                         he comes to.
                                      
                         (while searching)
                                     
                         We might find something interesting.
 
                                                              
                         (finds something)
                                     
                         Hello - what's this? A map!
                                     
                         (hands it to George)
                                     
                         He resumes his search enthusiastically. 
                         Suddenly he stops. The utter limpness 
                         of the pilot's body gives him pause. 
                         He lifts up his chin, stares into his 
                         face - pulls up his eyelid and then 
                         places a hand over his heart. He turns 
                         slowly toward George, who has been watching 
                         his brother intently.

                         George stares unbelievingly.

                         It must have happened the moment he 
                         hit the ground.
                                      
                         (a pause)
                                     
                         Let's take a look at this map.
                                     
                         Conway holds the map under the dashboard 
                         light. He studies it painstakingly, 
                         and his tense expression changes to 
                         one of deep concern. George's eyes are 
                         glued on him.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         What is it?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         See that spot?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Yes.
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         That's where we were this morning. He 
                         had it marked. Right on the border of 
                         Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. 
                         We must be a thousand miles beyond it 
                         - just a blank on the map.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         (afraid to ask)
                                     
                         What's it mean?
                                     
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         It means we're in unexplored country 
                         - country nobody ever reached.
                                      
                         George stares at him, wide-eyed, the 
                         gravity of their situation slowly penetrating 
                         his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts 
                         are interrupted by a knock on the panel, 
                         and he looks up.

                         We see the faces of Barnard and the 
                         others. We hear their voices inquiring 
                         - "Hey, Conway, what's happening?" - 
                         "What's up?" - "Where are we?" - "What'd 
                         you find out?"

                         Conway turns to George.

                         George, our chances of getting out of 
                         this are pretty slim. But it's up to 
                         us.
                                      
                         (a nod toward cabin)

                         As Conway enters, he is met by a volley 
                         of questions.

                         Everything's all right. The pilot won't 
                         trouble us any more. He's - he's dead.
 
                                                              
                         This is met by a series of exclamations.

                         the morning.

                         His terror-stricken eyes look dully 
                         before him. He stops in the doorway.

                         The storm will probably die down by 
                         then. My suggestion is that we better 
                         all try and get a good night's rest.

                         They all wheel around and face George.
 
                                                              
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Why don't you tell them we're a million 
                         miles from civilization, without a chance 
                         of getting out of here alive? It's slow 
                         starvation - that's what it is. It's 
                         a slow, horrible death!
                                      
                         When the significance of this outburst 
                         finally sinks into the chaotic minds 
                         of his listeners, they turn to Conway 
                         hopefully, certain he will refute it. 
                         But Conway looks beyond them at George. 
                         From his noncommittal silence, they 
                         realize that George's statement is the 
                         truth. They slip into their seats. The 
                         place is heavy with a fatalistic silence. 
                         George slowly crosses to his seat near 
                         Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes. 
                         Suddenly the air is rent with harsh, 
                         bitter laughter from Gloria. They all 
                         look up.

                         What a kick I'm going to get out of

                         She emits another outburst of semi-hysterical 
                         laughter.

                         Favoring Gloria. The bitterness of a

                         A year ago a doctor gave me six months 
                         to live. That was a year ago! I'm already 
                         six months to the good. I'm on velvet.[7] 
                         I haven't got a thing to lose

                         But you! - you, the noble animals of 
                         the human race, what a kick I'm going 
                         to get out of watching you squirm for 
                         a change.
                                      
                         (her voice cracks completely)
                                     
                         What a kick!
                                     
                         She flops into her seat and buries her 
                         head in her hands. For quite a while 
                         all we hear are her stifled sobs.

                         George throws sidelong glances at his 
                         brother, feeling his guilt.

                         Shooting from front of plane, taking 
                         in entire cabin. The only sound that 
                         comes in on the tragic quiet is the 
                         low moaning of the wind outside. A feeling 
                         of doom has descended upon the five 
                         people.

                         Shooting toward the mountains which 
                         seem to imprison the valley below. The 
                         snowstorm, treacherous in its fury, 
                         seems to threaten the valley with complete 
                         obliteration.

                         Of the plane, tilted over on its side. 
                         It is fully covered with snow. CAMERA 
                         PANS UP TO LOVETT AND BARNARD, shivering 
                         in their blankets as they pace worriedly.

                         George and Conway are missing. Lovett 
                         turns from the window.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         They've been gone for three hours.
 
                                                              
                         The others appear disinterested in this 
                         observation.

                         Left us here to rot. That's what they've 
                         done. Heroes of the newspapers!

                         Lovett sees something through the window.

                         George and Conway are seen walking briskly 
                         toward the plane, their few clothes 
                         a scant protection against the biting 
                         wind.

                         Here they come!
                                     
                         The others quickly glance up, just as 
                         Conway and George clamber aboard. Conway 
                         has a serious mien, but George is full 
                         of vigor and enthusiasm.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Hello, everybody.
                                     
                         He holds out his hat which he has been 
                         carrying, bottom side up.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, we found some food.
                                     
                         Barnard and Lovett rush to him.
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         No chance of our starving now.
                                     
                         When they see the contents of his hat, 
                         their faces fall.
                                      
                         LOVETT
                                     
                         What is it?

                         Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, 
                         have some. I've read of people lasting 
                         thirty days on this stuff.
                                      
                         They grab handfuls. He goes on:
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Listen, my brother and I have worked 
                         out a plan. If we use our heads, we 
                         should be able to keep alive for weeks, 
                         until he gets back.
                                      
                         LOVETT & BARNARD
                                     
                         Gets back? Where's he going?
                                     
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         He doesn't know. But he's starting out 
                         right away in the direction of India. 
                         Sooner or later he's bound to run into 
                         somebody - a tribe or something.

                         Throughout the previous scene he has 
                         been busily occupied making preparations. 
                         Out of the baggage hold he has brought 
                         some blankets and rope and has been 
                         wrapping his feet in them. As George 
                         speaks, he looks up and smiles.

                         Now here's the idea. We found a cave 
                         over by that small hill. After we bury 
                         the pilot, we're moving in. We can have 
                         a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised 
                         to see Bob back within a week.
                                      
                         Conway's smile dies on his face. We 
                         get a feeling he is attempting a futile 
                         journey, and is fully aware of it. He 
                         resumes the roping of his feet - his 
                         movements mechanical.

                         From their angle. In the distance, just 
                         appearing over the top of a hill, we 
                         see a caravan of natives approaching. 
                         They are not close enough to distinguish 
                         who or what they are, but that they 
                         are human beings is apparent.

                         Conway takes in the unbelievable sight. 
                         We hear the exultant exclamations of 
                         the others. Barnard and Lovett start 
                         out of the plane.

                         a trifle awe-stricken. Conway joins 
                         them. Gloria has stayed inside.

                         The approach of the caravan from the 
                         viewpoint of the group. It comprises 
                         some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins, 
                         fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the 
                         middle of the single file is Chang, 
                         an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward 
                         as their leader.

                         As Conway leaves his group and meets 
                         the oncoming party. He approaches Chang 
                         and bowing courteously, greets him in 
                         Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly 
                         and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English.

                         in the opposite direction

                         he was dead.

                         instructions to take care of the pilot.

                         have reached quite a height although 
                         the peak of the mountain they are ascending 
                         towers high above them. The cutting 
                         wind moans treacherously as it caroms 
                         off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops 
                         them.

                         narrow, treacherous footbridge and makes 
                         a slow, difficult crossing in heavy

                         Of the group. They round a curve and 
                         come upon a narrow crevice which opens 
                         up into a passageway. One by one they 
                         step through, assisted by the natives. 
                         On the other side, they sigh relievedly. 
                         Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill 
                         has lessened. They look up to inspect 
                         their surroundings and a startled look 
                         comes into their eyes.

                         What he sees leaves him transfixed. 
                         He stares unbelievingly before him for 
                         a long time.

                         A sight that is both magnificent and 
                         incredible. The eye-filling horizon 
                         before them throws out a softness and 
                         a warmth that is breathless. On the 
                         left is a group of colored pavilions 
                         that seem as if suspended on the mountainside. 
                         Down below, in the hazy distance, is 
                         a valley which gives one the impression 
                         of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending 
                         of soft colors. In every direction, 
                         wherever one might gaze, there is a 
                         feast of strange and heavenly beauty.

                         as he watches their astonished faces. 
                         Conway turns from the rare magnificence 
                         of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind 
                         and storm they had just encountered, 
                         and looks backward, in the direction 
                         from which they came to assure himself 
                         he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang, 
                         watching him, answers him before he 
                         can express his astonishment.

                         You see, we are sheltered by mountains

                         Barnard emerges from a room across the 
                         hall, and Lovett beckons to him. Both 
                         are attired in flowing robes not unlike 
                         the one worn by Chang.

                         It is in semi-darkness. The moon sends 
                         a stream of light through the windows. 
                         Outside we see the outline of towering 
                         mountains. Spread across the bed - her 
                         clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria 
                         - her face sunk deep in the pillows.

                         Gloria emits wracking coughs. After 
                         a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks 
                         are wet - her hair disheveled - her 
                         eyes bloodshot. We get an impression 
                         of someone who has suffered for hours. 
                         Finally, her coughing begins again - 
                         and unable to stand it, she rises and 
                         paces the floor - then she crosses to 
                         the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH HER - and into her eyes has come 
                         a grim, determined expression.

                         She is staring at the chasm below her.

                         you found everything satisfactory.

                         I'm glad you like it. It's made right 
                         here in the valley.

                         Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse 
                         us, we're very anxious to discuss ways 
                         and means of getting back home.

                         The first thing we want to do is to 
                         cable the Foreign Office. All of England 
                         is waiting to hear about my brother. 
                         There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready 
                         to take him back.

                         Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm 
                         afraid I can't help. Unfortunately, 
                         we have no wireless here. As a matter 
                         of fact, we have no means of communication 
                         with the outside world.
                                      
                         George stares at him suspiciously - 
                         and then turns to Conway for his reaction 
                         - but Conway is apparently disinterested 
                         in the whole conversation.

                         It's always been a source of deep regret, 
                         but the mountains surrounding us have 
                         made reception almost impossible.

                         In that event, we better make arrangements 
                         to get some porters immediately. Some 
                         means to get us back to civilization.

                         he goes, however, he turns to Conway.

                         Good night, Mr. Conway.
                                     
                         Conway, a little surprised at the distinction 
                         in his behalf, nods.

                         Chang exits. There is a hushed silence 
                         following Chang's departure.

                         That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. 
                         Conway, I don't like that man. He's 
                         too vague.

                         We didn't get much information out of 
                         him, did we Bob?

                         It seems to me we should be grateful. 
                         We were in a bad mess this morning.

                         After all, this is quite pleasant. Why 
                         not make ourselves comfortable until 
                         the porters do arrive?
                                      
                         While he was speaking, the muted strains 
                         of a violin float into the room. Conway 
                         rises.

                         a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards 
                         in the other room.

                         He disappears onto the balcony. George 
                         watches him go.

                         double solitaire.

                         Lovett detests the pet names, but follows. 
                         George thinks a moment - and crosses 
                         to balcony.

                         Conway is listening moodily to the soulful 
                         music. George wanders in beside him.

                         civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned 
                         at all.

                         At the moment, it seems to me we should 
                         be concerned about getting home. I'd 
                         give anything to be in London right

                         George, I've been putting things together. 
                         Do you notice the resemblance between 
                         those natives and the pilot? And why 
                         did those clothes materialize so conveniently 
                         when they met us at the plane? Chang 
                         himself just said that they never venture 
                         beyond that point. What brought them 
                         there? Unless it was to meet us?
                                      
                         GEORGE

                         Chang's first question was about the 
                         pilot.

                         There must be some connection between 
                         the plane and this place. They must 
                         have deliberately brought us here. Why, 
                         Bob? What reason could they have for 
                         doing a thing like that?

                         It is a huge room. The walls are lined

                         Conway has just finished browsing through 
                         one of the books.

                         A look of surprise spreads over Conway's 
                         face.

                         our general belief was in moderation. 
                         We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses

                         a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, 
                         envy, the desire to possess something 
                         owned by another. There can be no crime 
                         where there is a sufficiency of everything.

                         not be considered good manners to take 
                         a woman that another man wanted.

                         Chang smiles. Conway scarcely hears 
                         the last speech, for his attention has 
                         been caught by the playing of a piano. 
                         He stops to listen. Chang has walked 
                         out of scene.

                         Conway locates the direction whence 
                         the music comes, goes to a doorway where

                         He realizes Conway did not follow him 
                         and turns. When he sees Conway, his 
                         face clouds - and he starts toward him.

                         Conway watches someone through door

                         room, oddly shaped, and except for a 
                         piano, a harp and several chairs, is 
                         otherwise sparsely furnished. At the 
                         extreme end, the room is set off by 
                         an alcove of stained glass extending

                         At the piano we see an old man - and 
                         by his side is the girl Conway saw last 
                         night. They finish playing and both

                         sees Conway, off scene, and her face 
                         sobers - self-consciously.

                         Of course we have no money as you know 
                         it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal 
                         fortunes because, well, because there 
                         is no uncertain future here for which 
                         to accumulate it.

                         They have arrived in a small room, where 
                         they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl 
                         of large nuts, cracks one, and hands 
                         the nut to Conway. Then he does the 
                         same for himself. During the following 
                         scene, both are eating nuts from the 
                         bowl.

                         there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence 
                         somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did

                         A Belgian priest by the name of Father 
                         Perrault, the first European to find 
                         this place, and a very great man indeed. 
                         He is responsible for everything you 
                         see here. He built Shangri-La, taught 
                         our natives, and began our collection 
                         of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father 
                         Perrault.

                         Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I 
                         think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled 
                         into the Valley, half frozen to death. 
                         It was typical of the man that, one 
                         leg being frozen, and of course there 
                         being no doctors here, he amputated 
                         the leg himself.

                         Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had 
                         learned to understand their language, 
                         the natives told him he could have saved 
                         his leg. It would have healed without 
                         amputation.

                         Yes, yes. They were very sincere about 
                         it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect 
                         health is the rule here. They've never 
                         known anything different. So what was

                         be true for anyone else living here.

                         so in the case of Father Perrault himself. 
                         Do you know when he and the natives

                         Forgive me. I should have told you it 
                         is quite common here to live to a very 
                         ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain 
                         water, you might say. But we like to 
                         believe it is the absence of struggle 
                         in the way we live. In your countries, 
                         on the other hand, how often do you 
                         hear the expression, "He worried himself 
                         to death?" or, "This thing or that killed 
                         him?"

                         as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural 
                         death as by indirect suicide.

                         about it, they'll declare themselves 
                         in. But if I can mine that stuff, I'll 
                         throw a bombshell into Wall Street.

                         are you? Look, don't pay too much attention 
                         to what those doctors tell you. I've 
                         seen an awful lot of people fool them, 
                         and I've got a hunch that this place 
                         is going to be good for you. Honest,

                         kid, and snap out of it, and I'll cut 
                         you in on the gold deal. Look, I'm going

                         It is a bright, cheery morning. Conway 
                         is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings. 
                         He comes into the area where the horses 
                         are stabled. Two men are busily grooming 
                         the horses.

                         Suddenly, Conway is startled by the 
                         sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, 
                         is in time to see 'the girl' of the 
                         previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him 
                         on a horse - screaming delightedly. 
                         As she passes him, she waves.

                         but she is lost from sight. He wheels 
                         around several times - and unable to 
                         find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving 
                         up, he starts slowly back. After a few 
                         moments he is startled by her laughter, 
                         and glances around.

                         He has caught up to her tethered horse

                         She can apparently understand the squirrel's 
                         warning. She hurries to dive back into 
                         the water and swim to the other side. 
                         She comes up, spots Conway and watches 
                         him from hiding, behind some bushes.

                         Conway has discovered her clothing and 
                         is constructing a kind of scarecrow 
                         on a bush out of them. As a crowning 
                         touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, 
                         his eyes twinkling at his little joke. 
                         With one final glance over his shoulder, 
                         he turns to leave.

                         Conway is coming down the corridor. 
                         George comes out of door to dining room 
                         and starts forward. Conway walks along 
                         in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, 
                         a Cockney song.

                         silent, enters and drops in his seat. 
                         At the same moment, Gloria comes into 
                         the room.

                         turns suddenly and starts running. George 
                         levels his revolver and sends a stream 
                         of bullets after the fleeing servant, 
                         who miraculously manages to skate around

                         over his revolver arm - and with his 
                         right, he punches him flush on the jaw.

                         wanders over to Conway, who appears 
                         lost in thought.

                         Say Conway, is it true about us being 
                         kidnapped?
                                      
                         Conway shrugs.

                         Conway suddenly is aroused from his 
                         reverie by someone he sees off scene. 
                         He looks up alertly.

                         Chang enters scene, beaming charmingly.

                         As Chang enters. He bows courteously 
                         to the others, who stand in front of 
                         George's bed. Conway shuts the door 
                         and turns the key. He crosses to a door 
                         leading to another room - and locks 
                         this one, also. Chang watches him curiously. 
                         The others, including George, who is 
                         now alert, are puzzled and somewhat 
                         impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang.

                         Chang sits, his placidity unchanged. 
                         Conway pulls up a chair in front of 
                         him.

                         Mr. Chang, you have been very kind to 
                         us - and we appreciate it. But for some 
                         reason we are being held prisoners here, 
                         and we want to know why.

                         to Chang:

                         Personally, I don't mind at all. I'm 
                         enjoying every minute of it.

                         But my brother is not of the same opinion, 
                         nor are the others.

                         We want to know why we were kidnapped, 
                         why we are being kept here, but most 
                         important of all - do we get the porters, 
                         and when?
                                      
                         (much too suavely)
                                     
                         Until we get this information, my dear 
                         Mr. Chang, I am very much afraid we 
                         cannot permit you to leave this room.
 
                                                              
                         There is a pause while the eyes of all 
                         are centered on Chang's face.

                         adjusted to the darkness, he begins 
                         to sense the architecture and furnishings 
                         of the room. But as yet no sign of life. 
                         SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained 
                         and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather 
                         simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries 
                         drape the back walls. While the CAMERA 
                         FOLLOWS CONWAY'S GAZE, MOVING SLOWLY 
                         AROUND, a voice is heard.
                                      
                         HIGH LAMA'S VOICE
                                     
                         (soft and friendly)
                                     
                         Good evening, Mr. Conway.
                                     
                         CAMERA QUICKLY SWINGS OVER to the nethermost 
                         corner of the room where, scarcely visible, 
                         sits an old man of indeterminate age. 
                         In the gloom only the outlines of his 
                         pale and wrinkled face can be seen. 
                         It yields an effect of a fading antique 
                         portrait.

                         He stares, motionless, at the eerie 
                         vision.

                         Conway comes forward warily until he 
                         stands within a few feet of the old 
                         man, his eyes riveted upon him.

                         can do no one any harm.

                         As Conway, expressionless, sits down 
                         opposite the High Lama.

                         Personally, I've enjoyed your community 
                         very much. But my friends do not care 
                         for this mystery. They are determined 
                         to leave as soon as
                                      
                         While he has been speaking, his eyes 
                         have been gradually taking in the details 
                         of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS 
                         HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against 
                         the man's throne - then, looking down, 
                         to his legs, one of which appears to 
                         have been amputated.

                         You may not know it, but I've been an 
                         admirer of yours for a great many years.
 
                                                              
                         Conway evinces surprise.
                                     
                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder 
                         and public hero. I wanted to meet the 
                         Conway who in one of his books, said, 
                         "There are moments in every man's life 
                         when he glimpses the eternal."
                                      
                         The quotation captures Conway's interest 
                         - and his eyes widen.

                         That Conway seemed to belong here. In 
                         fact, it was suggested that someone 
                         be sent to bring him here.

                         That I be brought here? Who had that 
                         brilliant idea?

                         Yes. She has read your books and has 
                         a profound admiration for you, as have 
                         we all.

                         Of course I have suspected that our 
                         being here is no accident. Furthermore, 
                         I have a feeling that we're never supposed 
                         to leave. But that, for the moment, 
                         doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet 
                         that when it comes. What particularly 
                         interests me at present is, why was 
                         I brought here? What possible use can 
                         I be to an already thriving community?

                         We need men like you here, to be sure 
                         that our community will continue to 
                         thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La 
                         has much to give you. You are still, 
                         by the world's standards, a youngish 
                         man. Yet in the normal course of existence, 
                         you can expect twenty or thirty years 
                         of gradually diminishing activity. Here, 
                         however, in Shangri-La, by our standards 
                         your life has just begun, and may go 
                         on and on.

                         But to be candid, Father, a prolonged 
                         future doesn't excite me. It would have 
                         to have a point. I've sometimes doubted 
                         whether life itself has any. And if 
                         that is so, then long life must be even 
                         more pointless. No, I'd need a much 
                         more definite reason for going on and 
                         on.

                         We have reason. It is the entire meaning 
                         and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to 
                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw 
                         all the nations strengthening, not in 
                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and 
                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine 
                         power multiply until a single weaponed 
                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw 
                         a time when man, exulting in the technique 
                         of murder, would rage so hotly over 
                         the world that every book, every treasure, 
                         would be doomed to destruction. This 
                         vision was so vivid and so moving that 
                         I determined to gather together all 
                         the things of beauty and culture that 
                         I could and preserve them here against 
                         the doom toward which the world is rushing.
 
                                                              
                         (pause)
                                     
                         Look at the world today! Is there anything 
                         more pitiful? What madness there is, 
                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! 
                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity 
                         crashing headlong against each other, 
                         propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. 
                         The time must come, my friend, when 
                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality 
                         and the lust for power must perish by 
                         its own sword. Against that time is 
                         why I avoided death and am here, and 
                         why you were brought here. For when 
                         that day comes, the world must begin 
                         to look for a new life. And it is our 
                         hope that they may find it here. For 
                         here we shall be with their books

                         and their music and a way of life based 
                         on one simple rule: Be Kind.

                         When that day comes, it is our hope 
                         that the brotherly love of Shangri-La 
                         will spread throughout the world.

                         Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured 
                         each other, the Christian ethic may 
                         at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall 
                         inherit the earth.
                                      
                         A long silence ensues during which Conway, 
                         so engrossed is he in all he has just 
                         heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who 
                         has risen slowly and now stands before 
                         him. The Lama reaches down and gently 
                         touches him on the shoulder.

                         Conway kisses the High Lama's hand.

                         Conway slowly rises to his feet and 
                         turns to leave scene.

                         Conway comes through. He walks as if 
                         in a trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he 
                         continues on his way - bearing an expression

                         at the end of corridor leading to the 
                         garden. Lovett emerges from one of the 
                         rooms and sees him. He beckons to those 
                         inside and almost immediately they come 
                         out and start toward Conway.

                         Conway stares at them blankly.

                         We see Conway walk through the garden

                         As he walks along. He comes to a spot 
                         where a man and a woman are tilling 
                         the soil, and stops to watch them. The 
                         man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes 
                         a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway 
                         also bows. The woman curtsies prettily 
                         and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in 
                         acknowledgement.
                                      
                         He is in a cheerful frame of mind and 
                         continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING 
                         WITH HIM. He greets several other people. 
                         Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff 
                         their hats. Conway does likewise.

                         Conway is walking along a street in 
                         the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare, 
                         unlike anything we have ever seen before. 
                         The small, one-story huts along its 
                         very narrow sidewalk are of singularly 
                         varied architecture - giving the impression 
                         of being "homemade." As a result of 
                         this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic 
                         about them is similar - their cleanliness. 
                         Something about the atmosphere is fresh 
                         and wholesome and peaceful. In front 
                         of several of the huts native women 
                         sit - some weaving on a tapestry board, 
                         some nursing babies, some asleep, and 
                         some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.

                         With Conway, walking along. As he passes, 
                         the women smile at him in the most friendly 
                         fashion. From inside these homes, soft 
                         and soothing music emanates. At the 
                         end of the street, Conway finally arrives 
                         at a garden spot. The suddenness of 
                         this is startling, too - because of 
                         its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway 
                         throws himself at the foot of an overhanging 
                         tree, and leans against the trunk.

                         He throws his head back, shuts his eyes 
                         - in a restful and contemplative mood. 
                         He remains this way quietly for a few 
                         seconds, when he is attracted by the 
                         singing of a chorus of children's voices. 
                         He glances around.

                         From Conway's angle. In the shadow of 
                         a row of overhanging trees which form 
                         an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty 
                         children sing a hymn, or nursery song 
                         - in English. Sondra (the violin girl 
                         of previous scenes) stands in front 
                         of them, a baton in hand, conducting 
                         them.

                         He smiles at the sight - and springing 
                         to his feet starts in their direction.

                         Of Sondra and the children, as Conway 
                         saunters into the scene behind her. 
                         He finds himself a comfortable place 
                         under a tree and sits down. The children, 
                         still singing, have seen his approach 
                         and crane their necks curiously.

                         She waves her baton and sings with the 
                         children. Then she notices they are 
                         being distracted and casually turns 
                         her head. She is somewhat startled at 
                         seeing Conway, but quickly recovers 
                         her composure, and smiles wanly.

                         He smiles also.

                         To include Sondra, Conway and some of 
                         the children. They finish the song, 
                         and Conway applauds. Sondra curtsies 
                         prettily. She turns to the children.

                         In unison the twenty children curtsey.

                         Good morning, Mr. Conway.

                         Conway scrambles to his feet and does 
                         an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly.

                         She lifts her baton and the thin, piping 
                         voices fill the air.

                         He lights a cigarette and, leaning against 
                         a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed 
                         by her beauty.

                         She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious 
                         smile covers her face.

                         As a child from the ranks breaks and 
                         comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen 
                         to the child - who whispers in her ear. 
                         Sondra, murmuring, "Of course, dear" 
                         and still waving her baton is, for the 
                         moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning 
                         to Conway, holds out the baton to him.

                         Conway snaps out of his reverie and 
                         jumps forward.

                         He takes the baton from her.

                         And, taking the child by the hand, she 
                         exits.

                         Conducting the chorus in all seriousness 
                         - albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns 
                         his head to watch Sondra, and when he 
                         looks forward again, finds himself off-beat. 
                         To cover his embarrassment, he smiles 
                         foolishly.

                         They come to the end of the song, but 
                         Conway, whose eyes are searching for 
                         Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues 
                         to conduct mechanically. The children 
                         break into laughter.

                         With Sondra as she returns with the 
                         child clinging to her. As she turns 
                         a bend, she looks up, surprised.

                         As she laughs heartily.

                         The children break into squeals and 
                         race off. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as 
                         they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff 
                         their clothes and with yelps and cries 
                         leap into a stream.

                         THE CAMERA SHOWS PIGEONS swirling overhead.

                         Of a large coop where pigeons are bred 
                         and raised. The pigeons flutter around, 
                         landing on Sondra and Conway, as she 
                         shows him her collection with pride. 
                         She grabs one pigeon and ties one of

                         And by varying the size of the flutes,

                         Do you realize that there is a British

                         Well, I was almost born here. It took 
                         place in that wild country beyond the 
                         pass. My father and mother were in a 
                         party of explorers who got lost and 
                         wandered around for a year. When Chang 
                         found us, only Father and I were alive. 
                         But he was too weak to climb the pass. 
                         He died on the way. I was brought up 
                         here by Father Perrault himself.

                         Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked 
                         to him last night.

                         And that in itself is confusing. I have 
                         the same idea about Shangri-La. The

                         I've been kidnapped and brought here 
                         against my will. A crime, a great crime, 
                         yet I accept it amiably, with the same 
                         warm amiability one tolerates only from 
                         a very dear and close friend. Why? Can 
                         you tell me why?

                         Perhaps because you've always been a 
                         part of Shangri-La without knowing it.

                         I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's 
                         a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's 
                         heart. I have never seen the outside 
                         world. But I understand there are millions 
                         and millions of people who are supposed 
                         to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know 
                         that secretly they are all hoping to 
                         find a garden spot where there is peace 
                         and security, where there's beauty and 
                         comfort, where they wouldn't have to 
                         be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish 
                         the whole world might come to this valley.

                         Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for 
                         long.
                                      
                         She laughs as they exit scene.

                         along on an excursion into the Valley.

                         nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What

                         imagine why I'd allow you to drag me 
                         down here. Why, we don't know anything 
                         about these people. We're not even armed!

                         Lovett sees his point, starts to chuckle,

                         "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my 
                         bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh 
                         dear, somebody's been sleeping in my 
                         bed!" And then the big papa bear, he 
                         roared, "And somebody's been sleeping 
                         in my bed!" Well, you have to admit

                         confidently and admiringly in the mirror.

                         about it, it certainly doesn't sound 
                         very attractive.

                         It's not so bad, really. Some phases

                         catches up with her. He reaches to place

                         followed it. That silly shadow racing 
                         along over mountains and valleys, covering 
                         ten times the distance of the plane. 
                         It was always there to greet us with 
                         outstretched arms when we landed. And 
                         I've been thinking that somehow you're

                         over obstacles, never dreaming that

                         said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, 
                         I said, "Lovey"

                         Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you 
                         are an ungrateful fool . . . "

                         "Ungrateful fool . . . !" Those were 
                         my very words to myself last night.

                         was 20 at the time. She was on her way 
                         to join her betrothed - when her carriers 
                         lost their way in the mountains. The

                         I have waited for you, my son, for a 
                         long time. I have sat in this room and 
                         seen the faces of newcomers. I have 
                         looked into their eyes and heard their 
                         voices - always in hope that I might 
                         find you . My friend, it is not an arduous 
                         task that I bequeath, for our order 
                         knows only silken bonds. To be gentle 
                         and patient, to care for the riches 
                         of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while 
                         the storm rages without.

                         HIGH LAMA
                                     
                         You, my son, will live through the storm. 
                         You will preserve the fragrance of our 
                         history, and add to it a touch of your 
                         own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.

                         But I see in the great distance a new 
                         world starting in the ruins - stirring 
                         clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking 
                         its vast and legendary treasures. And 
                         they will all be here, my son, hidden 
                         behind the mountains in the Valley of 
                         the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a 
                         miracle.
                                      
                         The voice of the Lama, toward the last, 
                         seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly 
                         engrossed, half-consciously waits for 
                         it to continue. Following a protracted 
                         silence, he slowly turns toward the 
                         Lama. A breeze blows through the room, 
                         ruffling curtains on the window.

                         From whose face the glow has faded. 
                         There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed 
                         mask.

                         He stares, uncertainly, for a long while, 
                         with a slow realization that the High 
                         Lama is dead. Quite unaware that he 
                         is being moved emotionally, tears well 
                         up in his eyes. While still sitting 
                         this way, unable to stir, he becomes 
                         conscious of activity around him.

                         As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive 
                         - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the 
                         Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds, 
                         groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter 
                         softly and silently, and gather around 
                         the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable 
                         murmurs that might or might not be prayers. 
                         Conway is only vaguely aware of their 
                         presence - and after a few moments, 
                         scarcely conscious of what is actuating 
                         his movements, he drifts away from the 
                         murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction 
                         of the door.

                         Barnard and Gloria are on their knees 
                         on the floor. Before them they have 
                         spread a large map or chart. Barnard 
                         is enthusiastically out - lining his 
                         plans.

                         here, and we connect with the main water 
                         line here.

                         Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how 
                         to cast pipes out of clay.

                         get your things together. We're leaving.

                         porters. They're going to take us. We've

                         are waiting for us on the plateau. And 
                         that Chinaman thought he could stop 
                         me. Come along.

                         I think I'll stick around. I'll leave 
                         with the porters on their next trip.

                         I don't care what you've got started. 
                         Do you want to go?

                         Well - no - I think I'd better wait. 
                         Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
                                      
                         GEORGE

                         You'll wait till you rot!

                         Yes.

                         Lovett immediately dismisses George 
                         from his mind and his face brightening, 
                         he starts toward Barnard and Gloria.

                         Barney, I've just finished translating 
                         one of the most interesting old tablets 
                         you can imagine. It told me all about 
                         the origin of the Masonic symbols and

                         That's swell, Lovey. I want to show 
                         you something. Look!
                                      
                         He proudly displays his map.

                         As all three heads go into a huddle.

                         Conway stands in front of a window - 
                         his arms extended across - peering out 
                         moodily. He is watching a solemn and 
                         slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers 
                         - the funeral rites of the High Lama 
                         - accompanied by cermonial music and 
                         drum-beating.

                         Shooting over his shoulder.
                                     
                         Getting his view of the magisterial 
                         procession.

                         Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the 
                         surroundings of which he has just become 
                         master.

                         George appears in the doorway. He looks 
                         around and espies Conway. For a moment 
                         he stands uncertainly, and finally enters.

                         (softly)

                         As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces 
                         no emotion whatsoever.
                                      
                         CONWAY
                                     
                         (a murmur)
                                     
                         Hello, George.
                                     
                         George looks at him peculiarly. Conway's 
                         behavior is odd in view of their strained 
                         relationship.
                                      
                         GEORGE
                                     
                         Well, you can stop worrying about everything 
                         now, Bob. I've made arrangements to 
                         leave. If you'll let me close that window, 
                         I can talk to you. That noise is driving 
                         me crazy.
                                      
                         He closes the window.

                         I said we're getting out of here. Back 
                         to civilization. I made a deal with 
                         the porters. They brought in a load 
                         of books or something, and they're leaving 
                         tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for 
                         us five miles outside the valley. Come 
                         on, get your things together. Where's 
                         your top coat?

                         You mustn't. You've got to stay here 
                         now.

                         What's the matter with you, Bob? You've 
                         been acting strangely ever since we 
                         came here.

                         I've never seen you like this. Why can't 
                         we leave? What's stopping us?
                                      
                         Conway combats an impulse to tell him 
                         the whole story.

                         and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've 
                         found it, George, and I can't leave 
                         it. You mustn't either.

                         You're carrying around a secret that 
                         seems to be eating you up. If you'll 
                         only tell me about it.

                         I'll burst with it if I don't. It's 
                         weird and fantastical and sometimes 
                         unbelievable, but so beautiful!

                         As Conway is concluding his story.

                          . . . And that's the whole story, George. 
                         He died as peacefully as the passing 
                         of a cloud's shadow. His last words 
                         to me were, "I place in your hands, 
                         my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La." 
                         Now you know why I can't leave.
                                      
                         George listens to him intently, his 
                         face a mask of apprehension. He stares 
                         at his brother for some time and finally 
                         rises and walks around for a few moments.

                         Well, I - I really don't know what to 
                         say. Except that you must be completely 
                         mad.

                         What else can I think after a tale like 
                         that? Good heavens, Bob, things like 
                         that don't happen today. We're living 
                         in the twentieth century.

                         I think you've been hypnotized by a 
                         lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, 
                         I wouldn't believe it if I heard it 
                         in an English monastery. Why should 
                         I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof?

                         I knew there was a reason I hated this 
                         place. I'd give half my life to fly 
                         over it with a load of bombs just for 
                         what they've done to you. How do you 
                         know the things they told you are true? 
                         Did they show you any proof? All this 
                         talk about the Lamas being hundreds 
                         of years old. How do you know? Did you 
                         see their birth certificates?
                                      
                         (some more pacing)
                                     
                         I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of 
                         decrepit old men sit around and dream 
                         about reforming the world. And you, 
                         Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground 
                         Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.

                         What else could it mean to me? It's 
                         obviously a lot of bunk.

                         Then you'd better go, George. This is 
                         no place for you.

                         what's waiting for you. Do you want 
                         to stay here until you're half dead? 
                         Until your mind starts corroding like 
                         the rest of them?

                         about it anymore.

                         me? You said they stole that plane to 
                         bring you here. I didn't want to come. 
                         You owe me some responsibility.

                         Conway looks his extreme amazement.

                         George, you're crazy!
                                     
                         As he says this he jumps to his feet. 
                         George is startled by his tone and manner.

                         You can't take her away from here!

                         Why not?

                         Because you can't. Do you know what 
                         will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? 
                         She's a fragile thing that can only 
                         live where fragile things are loved. 
                         Take her out of this valley and she'll 
                         fade away like an echo.

                         What do you mean - "fade away like an

                         Favoring George. He laughs hollowly. 
                         He runs his hand through his hair. He 
                         stares unbelievingly at Conway.

                         This would be funny - if it wasn't so 
                         pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over 
                         twenty!

                         I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, 
                         she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know 
                         anyway.

                         I found out a lot of things last night.

                         I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably 
                         one of the few decent things that's 
                         ever happened in this hellish place.

                         Conway stares at him.

                         So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La?

                         It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded 
                         with me ever since I came here to take 
                         her away from this awful place. She's 
                         cried in my arms for hours, for fear 
                         I'd leave her behind. And what's more, 
                         she's made two trips to the plateau 
                         to bribe the porters - for me!

                         As he speaks he has crossed to door 
                         leading to adjoining room. Conway's 
                         eyes are glued on him.

                         After a few seconds Maria appears in 
                         the doorway and stands there timidly.

                         I've got some bad news for you, Maria. 
                         My brother and I have decided we can't 
                         take you along.
                                      
                         Maria's face collapses.

                         She rushes to George and throws her 
                         arms around him.
                                      
                         MARIA
                                     
                         But you promised me! You promised to 
                         take me with you!
                                      
                         Over her shoulder George looks victoriously 
                         at Conway, who cannot believe his ears. 
                         Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway.

                         until he spoke to you! Why can't you 
                         leave us alone?

                         I'll die if I have to stay here another 
                         minute! I've waited a long time for 
                         this chance to go, and you're not going 
                         to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go 
                         alone. It was I who bribed the porters. 
                         If it weren't for me, you'd never get 
                         out!

                         I thought the porters had instructions 
                         from the High Lama not to take anyone.

                         The High Lama? Who pays any attention 
                         to him? The porters laugh at the High 
                         Lama. All they want to know is how much 
                         gold he will give them. Well, I gave 
                         them more gold. I've been stealing it 
                         for a year. I'd do anything to get out 
                         of this place. To get away from that 
                         High Lama - the one who calls himself 
                         Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane 
                         for years!

                         He's dead? That's fine. You won't see

                         I thought so! He tells everyone I'm 
                         old. He wants them to stay away from 
                         me. He can't stand it when anyone comes 
                         near. He's punished me for every minute 
                         I've spent with George. If it weren't 
                         for him, I would have been out of here 
                         long ago, but he always stops me. Six 
                         months ago, I tried to escape and he 
                         locked me in a dark room. I nearly went 
                         crazy.

                         Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like 
                         an old woman? Is this the skin of an 
                         old woman? Look into my eyes and see 
                         if these are the eyes of an old woman?

                         She was kidnapped and brought here two 
                         years ago just as we were, Bob.

                         I don't believe it! I can't believe 
                         it. She's lying.

                         You're lying. You're lying! Every word 
                         you've been saying is a lie! Come on, 
                         say it!
                                      
                         He has backed her into a corner and 
                         is nearly throttling her.

                         No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What 
                         reason could I have for lying? The chances 
                         are that we'll never come out of that 
                         horrible trip alive, but I'd rather 
                         die out there in a snowstorm and be 
                         buried alive, than to stay here one

                         Thoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits 
                         a few cynical chuckles - shakes his 
                         head - stares blankly for a moment.

                         to make the trip. We'll have to send

                         name.

                         He hesitates at the opening, looks back 
                         one more time. His eyes show confusion 
                         and defeat. George, ahead, calls out 
                         to him to hurry.

                         on the other side. She cries and weeps, 
                         calling out Conway's name, but he can 
                         no longer be seen.

                         They edge their way pre-cautiously across 
                         a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses 
                         her bearings - slips - screams - and 
                         is caught by Conway just in time to

                         is dead. The men stare at her intently.

                         become alert with an idea. His face 
                         lights up with great determination. 
                         He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks 
                         away, racing out of scene.

                         over, and rolls down the mountainside, 
                         until finally he comes to a stop, mounded 
                         by snow. Slowly, he begins to rise and 
                         start again.

                         from the whiteness, feeling his way

                         Conway seemed to recover his memory. 
                         Kept talking about Shangri-La, telling 
                         a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. 
                         Insisted upon returning there at once. 
                         Locked him in room but he escaped us 
                         and jumped ship during night at Singapore. 
                         Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, 
                         as fearful of his condition. Wrote down

                         Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole 
                         course of my life, I have never encountered 
                         anything so grim. During these last 
                         ten months, that man has done the most 
                         astounding things. He learned how to 
                         fly, stole an army plane and got caught, 
                         put into jail, escaped . . . all in 
                         an amazingly short space of time. But 
                         this was only the beginning of his adventures.

                         He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing 
                         forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere 
                         I went, I heard the most amazing stories 
                         of the man's adventures. Positively 
                         astounding. Until eventually, I trailed 
                         him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.

                         memory - ah - his memory will live with 
                         those natives for the rest of their 
                         lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they 
                         called him. They'll never forget the 
                         devil-eyed stranger who six times tried 
                         to go over a mountain pass where no 
                         other human being dared to travel, and 
                         six times was forced back by the severest 
                         storms. They'll never forget the madman 
                         who stole their food and clothing - 
                         whom they locked up in their barracks 
                         - but who fought six of their guards 
                         to escape.

                         Why, their soldiers are still talking 
                         about their pursuit to overtake him, 
                         and shuddering at the memory. He led 
                         them the wildest chase through their 
                         own country, and finally he disappeared 
                         over that very mountain pass that they 
                         themselves dared not travel.

                         Tell me something, Gainsford. What do 
                         you think of his talk about Shangri-La? 
                         Do you believe it?

                         is my hope that Robert Conway will find

CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058
---------------------


FADE IN ON:

EXT.-SPACE

PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and
fast rushing crimson clouds.

A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space.

                      PILOT (OVER)

          Mars mining base, this is Grissom One,
          Request final descent vector.

REVERSE ANGLE

EXT.-MARS

A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the
spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a
landing pad, beckoning the ship.

                      CONTROLLER (OVER)

          Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars
          Mining, You are cleared to land. Hope
          you got some Partagas in that rust
          bucket, Sal.

EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE

THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the
vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere.

                      PILOT

          I brought you the most amazing...

Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the
bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire.

EXT.- MARS

LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME,
BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards
the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast.
Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash.

EXT.-CARGO SHIP

The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull.

WIDER

Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship,
FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship
overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire.

A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN.

INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER

A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up
holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the
pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider.

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome,
intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST.

                      WEST

          Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They're
          claiming the cargo ship violated
          their air-space.

INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER

Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING
towards the assault craft just below West's.

                      JEB

          This cold war's heating up. Where did
          they come from?

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

                      WEST

          Hell. And we're going to send them
          back screaming.

West activates his targeting computer.

                      WEST

          Last one to kill a bad guy buys the
          beer.

TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of
the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires.

EXT.-SPACE

The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack
Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent
surface of the bubble glass under West's feet.

                      WEST

          What's that sound? must be the fat lady
          warming up.

EXT.-SPACE

The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction,
heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships
heading straight for each other.

                      WEST

          That's right. Come on, come on, you wanna
          play, I wanna play.

EXT.-SPACE

The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision
vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      WEST

          I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She's
          gonna sing.

TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the
targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid.

                      COMPUTER

          Target lock.

EXT.-SPACE

Imminent collision.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass.

                      WEST

          The lights are dimming. The curtain's
          coming down. Sing you fat, old bag,
          sing!

West hits the firing stud.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead,
the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him.

INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER

(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of
flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the
blackness of space and the starfield beyond.

                      WEST

          Show's over.

Below, the second Attack Ship ROARS past, lasers FIRING, locked in a
pinwheel battle with Jeb's Bubble Fighter.

EXT.-SPACE

JEB'S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the high energy volley. Almost. A
laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the surface of his craft
sparking, suddenly scored with flames.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

The Attack ship is right behind him.

                      JEB

          Weapons are off line. Jettisoning main
          drive core.

EXT.-SPACE

The thruster core of Jeb's Bubble Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of
flame, soaring back into the pursuit craft. The Raider EXPLODES.

INT.-JEB'S CRAFT

Controls are sparking. Displays flicker. (OVER) An ALARM sounds.

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Failure in redundant drive systems.

Mars fills the view screen.


INT.-WEST'S CRAFT

The rescue craft are speeding toward Jeb's fighter below.

                      WEST

          Grissom, this is Eagle One. Those Pugs
          Will never reach him in time.

                      BASE (ON RADIO)

          Eagle one clear this frequency and
          return to base.

DON takes a beat. Then he spins his chair towards Mars, begins working
the controls.

                      WEST

          This is Eagle One. I'm going after
          him.

                      BASE (OVER)

          Negative Eagle one, your craft is not
          equipped

West hits his thrusters.

EXT.-SPACE

West's craft dives toward Jeb's ship and Mars below.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

Mars is coming up fast.

          Don?

                      WEST (OVER)

          It's a yes or no question.

Mars fills the windscreen. Jeb checks his status display.

                      JEB

          Marginal. But in the green.

          What are you doing?

                      WEST (OVER)

          Saving your ass. Read towards the
          canals. Now!

The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see. He grabs his
throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls.

EXT.-JEB'S SHIP

A tiny directional thruster FIRES, angling Jeb's craft so that it
scrapes the surface of Mars and dives into a giant canal, rocky walls
rushing up fast.

INT.-WEST'S SHIP

West is accelerating toward Jeb.

                      BASE (OVER)

          Major West, your ship is not equipped
          for rescue. You are not authorized to
          jeopardize this asset. That is
          a direct order. Acknowledge!

West slams a switch, deactivating his radio.

                      WEST

          Never liked that station, anyway.

He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below.

Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards
the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle.

INT.-3EB'S FIGHTER

The canal floor is rushing up fast.

                      COMPUTER

          Impact in five seconds.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Don is blasting toward the canal floor, almost as if trying to beat
Jeb's ship to a fiery impact below.

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Proximity alert.

                      WEST

          Jeb, I'm going to give you a little
          kiss. Don't take it the wrong way.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West angles his ship directly under Jeb.

INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER

The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly
obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship.

                      JEB

          Don, abort. Abort.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

Jeb's fighter is visible overhead.

West going up. Don angles the throttle.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter,
angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship
spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually
scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust.

INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER

                      JEB (OVER)

          Does this mean we're going steady?

West pulls his throttle all the way back.

EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL

West shoots up and out towards the dark of space.

                      WEST (OVER)

          You weren't getting out of buying
          those beers that easy.

The rescue craft converge on Jeb's ship as Don heads for base.

          chaos. We didn't even have lights.

The room lights suddenly dim. The Principal flickers, revealed as a
holograph, her head now sitting on Schwartzenegger body.

Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is
being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously
glancing behind couches, into cabinets.

                     PRINCIPAL (OVER)

          This is no laughing matter, Mrs.
          Robinson. Will is terribly gifted. His
          little time machines, though pure
          fancy, are the products of a truly
          brilliant mind.

The Principal's body has become Twiggy's. Now that of an ape. Maureen
pulls open a closet. Will sits inside. Grins.

                     WILL

          The changing shape of education.

                     MAUREEN

          No more monkey business.

Will shrugs, adjusts his deck. The Principal returns to normal.

                     PRINCIPAL

          The boy is starved for attention. Was
          there no way his father could have
          attended the science fair?

EXT.-HOUSTON - DAY

Probably Austin and Dallas too. Texas has become a giant urban sprawl
spreading into Mexico and beyond. Immense industrial air purifiers
hang in a dark, wet sky.

EXT.-HOUSTON SPACE COMMAND-ESTABLISHING

A giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-MISSION CONTROL-DAY

A MAN stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of PRESS.

He's a little uncomfortable with all the media attention. This is
PROFESSOR JOHN ROBINSON.

                     JOHN

          Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our
          on board robot will begin construction
          of a hypergate.

ON SCREEN a hi-tech orbital gate is highlighted and expanded.

                     JOHN

          By then, technicians here on Earth
          will have completed a companion
          hypergate in our planet's orbit.

ON SCREEN an image of an orbital gate now under construction.

                     JOHN

          Once both gates are complete, ships
          will be able to pass instantaneously
          between them. The Jupiter can bring
          the Dimondium back to Earth without
          the ten year delay of a return trip.

                     REPORTER

          Why can't you just use the Jupiter's
          hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha
          Prime?

                     JOHN

          As you know, hyperspace exists beneath
          normal space. If you try to enter
          hyperspace without a gate

ON SCREEN a graphic spaceship appears randomly in the corner of a
turning schematic of the galaxy.

                     JOHN

          Your exit vector is random. There's no
          telling where you'd come out.

                     REPORTER

          Professor, how is Captain Daniels
          recovering from the flu? Will we still
          be able to pilot the mission?

John glances to the doorway where a uniformed GENERAL stands.

                     GENERAL

          Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get
          a look at the Jupiter One. Don't you
          think you've waited long enough?

John hits a button and the room darkens. A giant monitor reveals...

INT.-LAUNCH DOME

A giant saucer sits connected to its launch pad by loading belts,
steaming fuel tubes and spindled gantries.

                     REPORTER (OVER)

          Professor, how does your family feel
          about leaving the Earth behind....

                     JOHN (OVER)

          They couldn't be more excited.

CHAPTER 3: Goodbye!
-------------------


EXT.-ROBINSON HOUSE-ESTABLISHING

A suburban colonial, the launch dome towering in the distance.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          This whole mission sucks!

INT.-ROBINSON HOME HALLWAY-SUNSET

PENNY ROBINSON (14) furious, turns, looks downstairs at Maureen.

                      PENNY

          I Don't want to stay home for dinner.
          I want to see my friends for the last
          time.

She takes a beat, blinking away the tears. Lifts her wrist and turns
on a video camera watch. She begins down the hall.

VIDEO-POV. Penny's face in the monitor screen.

                      PENNY

          ... On the eve before she is torn from
          her friends, kidnapped, hurled into
          deep space against her will, what
          thoughts fill the mind of the young
          Space Captive....

INT.-WILL'S ROOM-SUNSET

Penny enters a strewn, boy' a world. Will is trying to select items to
place in a single packing canister marked: PERSONAL CARGO.

                      WILL

          Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri?
          What will I wear?

                      PENNY

          When we wake up in ten years the video
          journals of Penny Robinson, Space
          Captive, will be devoured by millions.
          I will be world famous. You on the
          other hand, will have been totally
          forgotten.

Penny shows the camera her arm, covered by strings of ribbons.

                      PENNY

          The Space Captive has decided to wear
          ribbons of support for fellow
          sufferers as she is dragged into deep
          space, green for the ecological
          issues, white for human rights

                      WILL

          You'd probably gag if I described the
          secondary infections loss of
          circulation can cause.

Penny seems about to speak, instead just smiles, goes to his bed and
pulls off the sheets, begins knotting them together.

                      WILL

          What are you grinning at?

                      PENNY

          I just found an upside to this
          mission. The thought of jettisoning
          your body into deep space.

Penny knots the sheets into a rope, ties it to the bed-post. Will
lifts several palm-sized gold-plated stars. Each reads: 1st prize.

                      WILL

          Dad says Don't bring them. Like
          anything I do matters to him.

                      PENNY

          He never showed, huh?

                      WILL


          Maybe if I had actually broken the
          time barrier he would have paid
          attention.

                      PENNY

          Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He
          just gets busy with work is all.

Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb.

                      WILL

          So, that's a no to family dinner?

                      PENNY

          Let's see, do I spend my last night on
          Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not
          to be fighting again or get in ten
          years of making-out at the mall ...
          you do the math.

                      WILL

          Mom's gonna go thermal.

                      PENNY

          What's she gonna do. Ground me?

CHAPTER 4: Major West
---------------------


INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR

John and the General walk the metal passageway.

                      JOHN

          We're lucky they didn't press on
          Daniels, condition.

                      GENERAL

          I figured a chance to look at the ship
          would keep the dogs at bay.

                      JOHN

          Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a
          replacement pilot at the last second.
          My family' a on this mission. I need
          someone who's more than just spit and
          polish.

                      GENERAL

          I've got your man. He just doesn't
          know it yet.

The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal...

INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS

A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a
salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.

                      GENERAL

          At ease, Major.

                      WEST

          Sir, why was I pulled off active duty?
          I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll
          fight a court martial, General.

                      GENERAL

          Do you know Professor Robinson?

                      WEST

          By reputation only.

          (to John)

          Your father's battle strategies were
          required reading at the Academy.

                      GENERAL

          How much do you know about the Jupiter
          Mission, Major?

                      WEST

          The Jupiter is fully automated. The
          pilot flies the ship out of the solar
          system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's
          a baby sitting job, sir.

                      GENERAL

          Major, you are aware Earth's resources
          are severely limited.

                      WEST

          Every schoolchild knows our recycling
          technologies will save the
          environment. Sending a family across
          the galaxy is a publicity stunt to
          sell soda to people of all ages.

                      GENERAL

          What I am about to tell you is
          classified. Every schoolchild
          has been lied to. The recycling
          technologies have failed. In
          less than two decades Earth will be
          unable to support human life.

                      GENERAL

          We spun the ad campaign to give the
          mission a friendly face, keep people
          from panicking in the streets. We
          partnered with Coke because the 900
          billion this mission cost would have
          bankrupted the government. The
          SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth
          as well as we do. They hope to reach
          Alpha Prime first - And if they do,
          I guarantee you, they will not share
          the Dimondium with Western Demons like
          us. our crops will wither. We will be
          left to die.

                      WEST

          ...Captain Daniels doesn't have the
          flu, does he sir?

                      GENERAL

          Daniels was murdered in his apartment
          last night. The flu story is a cover
          we fed the press.

                      WEST

          Dan was a good pilot. A good man.

                      GENERAL

          Your rescue stunt over Mars was
          foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major.

                      WEST

          I had a friend in trouble.

                      GENERAL

          You endangered a one billion dollar
          spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order
          because of a friend?

                      WEST

          Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir.

                      JOHN

          He'll do.

          (stepping forward)

                      GENERAL

          Congratulations Major, you're the new
          pilot of the Jupiter mission.

CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith
--------------------


EXT.-DESERT-DAY

Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking
to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.

                      MAN

          Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory
          lane is required. I was contracted
          to provide Daniels, apartment code.
          My work is done.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          They found a replacement pilot, the
          mission is going ahead on schedule.

                      MAN

          How tragic. For you.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          We require more direct intervention.

                      MAN

          I see. Well, that will cost you. And,
          I'm afraid my price has just become
          ... astronomical.

(OVER) a KNOCK. The man reaches forward and presses a button. The
businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs.

Room lights.

Lights come up to reveal...

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-MEDICAL LABS

The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This
is DR. ZACHARY SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the
portal hiss open. A TECHNICIAN ENTERS.

                      TECHNICIAN

          Control hasn't received the results
          of your final pre-flight exams,
          Doctor Smith.

The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are
displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft. Removes the
micro-files, hands them to the technician.

                      SMITH

          The Robinsons are checked out at one
          hundred percent. They are in perfect
          condition and ready to fly.

He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it.

                      SMITH

          Wish them good luck for me.

CHAPTER 6: Welcome Aboard!
--------------------------


INT.-SPACE COMMAND-WALKING

Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship.

                      GENERAL (OVER)

          The mission protocols are simple.
          Professor Robinson is in command
          unless you encounter a military
          emergency. In that case, Major West,
          you will assume command.

The figures have come to the saucer entry-port.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Welcome aboard, Major.

INT.-JUPITER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Don, John, and the General ENTER. Don's eyes widen.

West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this
baby.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen. Don walks
to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls.

                      JOHN

          Some of this technology might be new
          to you. I'll be happy to explain.

                      WEST

          (off the com)

          Cold fusion drive

          (off the size consoles)

          Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations.

Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge. Flicks a switch
and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad.

                      WEST

          Holographic navigational interface.

Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall.

                      WEST

          Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.

He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge.

                      WEST

          Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and
          living quarters are below decks.
          Hyperengine should be in here.

Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense ENGINE ROOM.

                      JOHN

          If you have to baby sit, it's not
          such a bad nursery, wouldn't you
          agree, Major?

Just then the ELEVATOR rises from the lower decks. On its circular
platform stands a DOCTOR in a lab coat. She walks to the General.

                      DOCTOR

          The cryosleep systems are running at
          ninety five percent.

                      GENERAL

          Doctor Smith approved the specs-

                      DOCTOR

          Doctor Smith is base physician. I am
          responsible once this ship is in
          flight. These tubes have to keep the
          crew in suspended animation for ten
          years. They will be perfect or this
          ship will not launch. Is that clear?

                      GENERAL

          Absolutely, Doctor.

                      JOHN

          Judy, I'd like you to meet Major
          West. He's taking Mike's place.

                      DOCTOR

          He's heavier than Mike. We'll have to
          re-calibrate.

                      WEST

          I'd be more than happy to discuss my
          dimensions perhaps over dinner?

                      DOCTOR

          West - I've read about you. Something
          of a war hero, aren't you?

                      WEST

          (preening )

          Well, yes, actually.

                      DOCTOR

          Those who can't think, fight.

          (a freezing smile)

          Well, nice to have met you.

She heads toward the readouts. West turns to John.

                      WEST

          That's one cold fish I'd love to
          thaw.

                      JUDY

          (turning)

          I'm not going to make it home for
          dinner, Dad.

West turns to John. Dad?

                      WEST

          It's going to be a long flight.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

Lights burn in the windows.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-DINING ROOM-NIGHT

John ENTERS to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table,
candles never lit, food never eaten.

John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table. Around it
hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          He won first prize again. He
          practically brought down his entire
          school. But he won first prize.

Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John.

                      JOHN

          A non-working prototype for his time
          machine. Sharp stuff for a midget.

Maureen is silent.

                      JOHN

          I'm sorry about dinner. I had to work
          late. The new pilot-.

                      MAUREEN

          What you had to do was prioritize
          your family over the mission

                      JOHN

          Maureen. This mission is about our
          family. So we can stay together

                      MAUREEN

          The perfect nuclear family. The most
          stable social unit, ideally suited
          for the isolation of a long journey
          into space. It's all just PR, John.
          You're never home. Judy is
          becoming a ghost just like you. Penny
          can't see past her own navel and Will
          has to black out-his school, just to
          get his father's attention. The
          perfect nuclear family in ruin.

John stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair.

                      JOHN

          I know, Maureen. I'm scared too.

A beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close.

INT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT

John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something
hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags.

WIDER

Will lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat. John turns, heading
out into the hall.

EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT

The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the
launch dome towering in the distance.

INT.-SPACE COMMAND-LAUNCH DOME-NIGHT

The Jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries, final supplies rolling
into the
ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts.

                      LOADING TECHNICIAN #2

          I'm showing a late shipment from
          Mission Medical. Smith's
          authorization. Here it is now.

HOLD on a canister that reads: BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS: Do Not Open, as
it passes on the loading belt. FOLLOW THE DRUM as it winds along the
conveyer, up a gantry towards the Jupiter One. PUSH IN...

INT. -CARGO DRUM

Smith sits crouched inside, cleaning his nails.

INT.-JUPITER ONE-LOWER DECKS

A giant robot stands attached to its service bay. Still. Silent.

A SERVICE DRAWER slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his
face visible in the dim service light. Smith.

Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the
Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device.

                      SMITH

          You'll forgive me if I forgo the
          kiss, my sleeping behemoth.

Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators
light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad.

                      SMITH

          But the time has come to awake.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
          directives. One, preserve the
          Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship
          systems. Three

                      SMITH

          Spare me the chatter.

Smith taps the keypad. The Robot is silenced. Smith types again.

                      SMITH

          What noble charges my steely
          centurion. Sadly I fear you have far
          more dire deeds in store for you.

Smith completes his re-programming. Hits a switch.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary
          directives. Two hours into mission
          destroy Robinson family. Destroy all
          systems.

Smith smiles. Removes the re-programming module.

                      SMITH

          Now that's more like it. Farewell my
          tin-plated pal. Give my regards to
          oblivion.

Smith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL.

INT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE

Smith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module
BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link.

From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into
the crawlspace over Smith's face.

                      SMITH

          I told you never to call me here.

                      BUSINESSMAN

          I see you have completed your mission
          on schedule Good work, Doctor. And
          goodbye.

The Businessman smiles. SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled.

Suddenly the tiny module in his hand OVERLOADS, the flesh on his palm
smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge. He goes out, his
body perfectly still.

CHAPTER 8: Launch!

EXT.-SPACE COMMAND-MORNING

The giant dome shines in the early sun.

INT-JUPITER ONE  John and Maureen face will and Penny who stand now in
their freezing tubes. All  wear silver flight suits. Maureen moves
Penny's hair from in front of her face.

                      PENNY

          Don't, mom. Vogue says this will be
          the style in ten years.

                      WILL

          Will she wake up less annoying?

                      PENNY

          Does he have to wake up at all?

                      MAUREEN

          Alright you two, enough.

Maureen kisses her children. John moves to will who reaches to shake
at the same moment John tries to hug him. A beat. Then John tries to a
shake as Will goes for the hug. A total miss. Will backs into his
tube.

                      MAUREEN

          You get a C in paternal expression,
          Professor. But an A for effort.

John kisses his wife, already in her tube.

                      MAUREEN

          You always get an A in that.

                      JUDY

          Don't let me shatter this unbridled
          display of affection, but we are
          running behind.

          Major, she's all yours.

                      WEST

          I'll try to give you a smooth ride.

Judy walks the row, checking their bio-monitors. Enters her tube.

                      JUDY

          Major. Drive carefully.

              (touches her com-link)

          initializing cryostasis tubes.

The tubes rotate closed around the Robinsons. Suddenly each crew
member is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow, brightening like a
star and then subsiding. All stand fixed in suspended animation.

Don stares at the family a beat. He goes to the main console. Straps
himself in.

                      WEST

          Mission Control, this is Jupiter One.
          The Robinsons are asleep. We are

CHAPTER 9: Destroy!
-------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE-LATER

Smith lies still. He starts from a nightmare into...-a nightmare

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Smith scrambles out of the chute, stares at his hand, the impression
of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm.

He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits
a stud. The blast shield opens. Space.

SMITH-CLOSE. Shock. No words.

THE ROBOT-CLOSE. In his docking bay. Suddenly the automaton powers up,
lights activating as his CPU comes on line.

                      SMITH

          No.

Smith turns, slaps the burned out programming module on the Robot.

                      SMITH

          Disable program.

No response. The Robot continues to power up.

Smith engage interface. Initiate system shut-down.

          Robinson family, destroy.

                      SMITH

The Robot rolls towards the bridge.

                      ROBOT

          All operating Systems, destroy.

Smith grabs a wrench from a tool bracket, leaps for the Robot. The
Robot swings once, sending Smith flying into a flaring console.

                      ROBOT

          Jupiter Two, destroy.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL-NIGHT

Dark. A single Techie (ANNIE) mans the watch, playing holo-games with
a stylus over her desk. SCREENS flicker into life.

                      ANNIE

          What the-?

          (into a mic)

          Somebody wake up the chief.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Still. The bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on.

The Robot rolls onto the bridge, faces the cryosleep array. He extends
his arms, an electrical charge arcing between his claws.

                      ROBOT

          Robinson Family, destroy.

He fires, a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls.
(OVER) ALARMS sound as the tubes begin to descend, electricity
sparking across the sleeping Robinsons.

                      SMITH (OVER)

          Mechanical moron. You'll kill us all.

Smith, wrench in hand, rushes the Robot, is again hurled across the
room. The Robot turns towards the navigational computer.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Fully lit. All the monitors are manned by sleepy Techies. Noah ENTERS,
taking a coffee from Annie without breaking stride. , ALARMS flash

          This mission's over. Wake them up.

The Techies begins working the controls.

                      ANNIE

          No response, sir. I'm sorry.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the
bridge. The electricity arcs between his claws once again.

                      ROBOT

          Operating systems, Destroy.

Smith is slumped against the bulkhead. He shakes off his fall in time
to see the Robot fire at the navigational array, the holograph
disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship begins to veer off course, falling towards the sun.

INT.JUPITER TWO

The Robot is rolling toward the com.

THE FREEZING TUBES are quickly being engulfed in flames. Smith
stumbles toward their control station. Begins typing madly.

                      SMITH

          Wake up, damn you. I can't stop this
          infernal contraption on my own.

He SMASHES a glass panel that reads EMERGENCY DEACTIVATE. The figures
inside the lowering tubes glow. All except Judy.

The Robot is before the Com, electricity arcing between his claws.

                      SMITH

          (off the tubes)

          Hurry up. Hurry up.

The Robot FIRES at the main Com, controls EXPLODING everywhere. The
freezing tubes begin to open, the Robot spinning to face them.

John blinks to life first. Emerges, ducking a BLAST of electrical
energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling.

                      JOHN

          Maureen. The children.

Maureen grabs Will and Penny, pulls them down just as the Robot blows
away their tubes.

John pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount.

                      JOHN

          Disengage safety.

                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed.

The Robot spins towards John, FIRES an electrical charge - John dodges
at the last instant, the grazing blast burning his silvery suit,
singeing his side, sending into the wall, his gun flying.

                      WILL

          Dad!

Will ducks under his mother's arm, scrambles across the bridge.

                      MAUREEN

          Will, wait.

The Robot FIRES at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing
down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks.

DON leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the
Robot's power source. The mechanical monster electrifies his shell,
sending the Major flying.

The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen. Extends his arms toward them.

Electricity arcing between his claws. The two are done for. Maureen
puts her hand over Penny's eyes.

                      MAUREEN

          Look away, baby.

The Robot is about to fire. Suddenly the Robot freezes, his claws
deactivate, his power lights go to stand-by and he stands immobile.

WIDER. Will stands in the b.g., his tiny hacking deck in his hands.

                      WILL

          Robot. Return to your docking bay and
          power down.

                      ROBOT

          Command accepted.

The Robot turns and begins heading for the elevator. All watch in
amazement. Will grins, a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes.

                      WILL

          If the family won't come to the
          science fair, bring the science fair
          to the family.

An EXPLOSION rocks the ship.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Mom, look, it's Doctor Smith.

Penny stands over Smith who lays crumpled in the corner. Maureen grabs
an emergency medi-kit from a wall clamp, tosses it to Penny.

                      MAUREEN

          Pulse, respiration and bleeding-

          NEXT picnic, no robots.

Don moves fast to the helm. The main view screen is still closed,
covered by giant metal blast shields.

West turns, spots Smith for the first time.

                      WEST

          (to John)

          Try the emergency back-ups.

Don moves to the fallen figure, lifts him up against the bulkhead.

          Smith, what the hell-

                      SMITH

          I was making a last minute check ...
          someone hit me from behind.

Don almost buys it. Then he notices Smith's hand, grabs it.

BURN-CLOSE. The reprogramming module's distinctive, foreign signature
seared into his flesh.

                      WEST

          Sino-Jordanian technology. You're a
          Goddamned spy.

          (realizing)

          You did this.

Don slams him against the bulkhead, begins dragging him towards the
airlock. The pilot hits a switch. The inner hatch opens.

                      SMITH

          Stop. What are you doing?

                      WEST

          Dropping some extra weight.

          Help, somebody. Please.

REVERSE ANGLE

Maureen stands at Judy's freezing tube. The young doctor's cryofield

          The thawing engine in broken. can't
          get her out. She's dying.

Smith uses the distraction to palm-slam Don in the chin, knocking him
backwards. Don staggers, goes again for Smith.

                      SMITH

          Touch me and the girl dies.

Don freezes in his tracks.

                      SMITH

          Your mission physician is indisposed.
          I can save her life. But only if you
          spare mine.

                      WEST

          I Don't deal with dead men.

                      SMITH

          Kill me, I kill the girl. How much is
          your revenge worth, Major? I will, of
          course, need your word as an officer
          that you will let me live.

Don's decision is lighting fast.

                      WEST

          Help her.

                      JOHN

VIEWSCREEN CLOSE. The blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb
in their path. They are heading directly for the sun.

          Uh-oh.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

Noah stands over the Com. The room is a madhouse.

                      NOAH

          Give me a telemetry projection.

Noah looks up at the main monitor. The graphic of the Jupiter Two is
heading towards the graphic of the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

John and Don stand over the Com.

                      NOAH (OVER)

          You're way off course. We show you in
          the sun's gravitational pull.

                      WEST

          How long do we have?

                      NOAH (OVER)

          We count seven minutes before your
          outer hull begins to melt.

DON straps himself into the pilot's chair.

                      WEST

          I'm going to try for the Mercury
          Mines.

SMITH stands at the freezing tube, Penny and Maureen assisting him.

                      SMITH

          I will need Dr. Robinson's portable
          gurney. I believe it is stored in-

                      PENNY

          I'm on it.

Penny races off. Smith begins working the controls to Judy's freezing
tube.

                      MAUREEN

          We trusted you.

          (sinking in)

          You tried to kill us all.

                      SMITH

          Existence offers us nothing if not
          the opportunity for an endless series
          of betrayals.

          (off her stunned expression)

          There's a world behind the world,
          Professor Robinson. Lie once, cheat
          twice and everything becomes clear.
          Do not mistake my deception for a
          character flaw. It is philosophical
          choice, a profound understanding of
          the universe. It is a way of life.

                      MAUREEN

          You're a monster.

                      SMITH

          Perhaps. But I am also the only one
          who can save your daughter's life.

Penny reappears, a case in hand. She presses a button and the case
unfolds into a hovering, gyroscopicaly-leveled gurney.

                      MAUREEN

          Where's Will?

                      PENNY

          He's futzing with that Robot.

                      SMITH

          Alright, Penny dear, I need you to
          short the power on my command.

                      PENNY

          Does he have to call me dear?

                      SMITH

          Professor, if you will assist me in
          lowering the body.

Smith hands Penny a wrench.

                      SMITH

          Penny, dear. Now.

Maureen nods. Penny SLAMS the wrench into the power circuit. The
freezing field FLARES and deactivates, the tube swinging open.

LIFESIGN MONITOR-CLOSE. Flatline.

                      MAUREEN

          She's dying.

Smith and Maureen lower her onto the gurney.

                      SMITH

          Sickbay. Move.

Penny, Maureen and Smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards
Sickbay just as the ship tilts madly.

AT THE HELM

WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. The sun is growing ever larger.

                      WEST

          Unable to re-route to Mercury. The
          sun's pull is too strong.

          Noah, I need options.

INT.-MISSION CONTROL

                      NOAH

          I'm sorry, Don.

ON SCREEN-THE JUPITER TWO is heading towards the sun.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-SICKBAY

Penny, Smith and Maureen have transferred Judy onto a hi-tech
scanning-bed. A hovering holographic schematic of Judy's physiognomy
appears over her, descends onto her body.

                      SMITH

No cardio-pulmonary or respiratory functions.

                      MAUREEN

          Body temp at 68 Fahrenheit.

                      SMITH

          Get her flight suit off.

Penny unzips the silver material as Smith works the console,
highlighting her holographic heart.

                      SMITH

          Clear.

The holographic image of her heart beats once, then is still.

                      SMITH

          Again. Clear.

The lights flicker on the bio-console, the holograph winks out.

                      SMITH

          Power's down.

                      MAUREEN

          We're losing her.

INT. -JUPITER TWO

DON and John man the Com. The sun is a raging fireball dead ahead.

                      JOHN

          I've re-routed all secondary systems
          to the main drive.

          My family's not going die in space.

Smith begins pumping Judy's chest by hand.

                      SMITH

          Come on, child. Fight. Put a little
          heart in it.

Smith steps back, begins precise, staccato blows to Judy's chest.

                      SMITH

          The life.. .

Smith stops, presses his ear to her chest - Takes her pulse. Smiles.

                      MAUREEN

          Judy? Baby?

A beat. Then Judy opens her eyes, manages a weak smile.

                      JUDY

          You should try to look less worried.
          It has a tendency to spook the
          patients.

                      MAUREEN

          (to Smith)

          Thank you.

Smith holds her gaze, his eyes almost snake-like.

                      SMITH

          You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man
          could see that. I hope I have proven
          the well-being of your family is of
          great importance to me. Perhaps, if
          you convinced your husband to trust
          me...

Maureen stares at him. A beat. She pulls a laser from the wall. Points
it at his forehead.

                      MAUREEN

          Stabilize her, Smith. Because you only
          breathe as long as she does.

DON stares at him.

          That's it.

                      JOHN

          What's it?

                      WEST

          We can't get away from the sun. So we
          have to go through it.
          The hyperdrive -

Will scrambles onto the bridge, heads towards John who is working the
main control panel.

          baby can do.

John takes Will's hand as West engages the hyperdrive.

West, John and Will, are hurled backwards from the sudden
acceleration, sticking to the walls and ceiling respectively.

INT.-SICKBAY

Maureen and Penny watch as Smith swaddles Judy in thermal blanket.
Suddenly, Maureen, Penny, and Smith fly against the walls. Judy is
held in place by the gurney straps.

Noah stares at the screen.

          Godspeed.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies into the mighty ball of the sun. And just as it
reaches the tallest of the gaseous mountains, the ship becomes
translucent, falling through the orb, elongating and then vanishing in
a sudden star of hyperspace.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

THE WINDSCREEN. The sky breaks apart giving way to a starfield.

EXT.-DEEP SPACE

Quiet. Empty. Suddenly space distorts and, in a sudden flash, a ship
appears, hurling into the darkness. The Jupiter Two.

The Jupiter Two comes to rest at the edge of an alien, twin starred
solar system, near a giant crimson planet.

CHAPTER 11: Lost in Space
-------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-INFIRMARY

Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay. Smith
stands silently in the b.g. Judy's gurney is empty. John ENTERS, his
face wrought with fatherly concern.

                      JOHN

          Is everyone okay?

                      MAUREEN

          All in one piece. Although Major West
          has the most puzzling definition of a
          smooth ride.

                      JOHN

          Judy? Where's Judy?

Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit.

                      JUDY

          Boy either I cut down on the coffee
          or sew in a flap. It's hell getting
          in and out of this thing.

                      JOHN

          Are you-

                      JUDY

          Vitals are normal. Pulse and
          respiration seem to be-

                      JOHN

          Baby, are you okay?

                      JUDY

          I'm fine Daddy really.

John holds her close, spared a father's worst fear.

                      SMITH

          Will every disaster be an excuse for
          familial sentiment? Please tell me
          now so I may gather up a liberal
          supply of space sickness bags.

Don turns towards Smith. Maureen steps between them.

                      MAUREEN

          What happened, John? Where are we?

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE

Don in at the navigational holograph, patching sparking wires. The
rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge.

                      WEST

          You had me worried, Doc. Nice to see
          you thawed.

                      JUDY

          Smart maneuver with the hyper-drive.

                      WEST

          A fighter who thinks, what do you
          know? You're just in time for the
          show.

Don makes a connection. The pedestal powers up, a holograph of the
Jupiter Two appearing over its surface.

                      WEST

          Computer, map our current location.

HOLOGRAPHIC PEDESTAL-CLOSE. The area around the Jupiter Two is now
filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system.

                      JOHN

          See anything familiar?

Don just shakes his head.

          We're lost, aren't we?

Judy wraps her arm around her sister.

                      WEST

          What the hell is that?

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The nearest planet is starting to glow. Suddenly a
distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of
space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal.

                      JOHN

          Any effect on the ship?

                      WEST

          No.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. All the planets and constellations beyond the
portal appear to be in different places.

                      JOHN

          (off the navigational hologram)

          All the planets have moved.

                      WEST

          And where did that come from?

CHAPTER 12: The Proteus
-----------------------


EXT.-SPACE

Breaking the inner edge of the portal, a long silver space needle
catches the light from the dual suns.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The crew man their stations. Only Will is absent as they the ship
maneuver around the portal.

VIEWSCREEN -CLOSE. As they, move behind the portal it seems to
disappear, showing only the blackness of space. No ship beyond.

                      WEST

          It's gone.

                      JOHN

          No. Go back in front of it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is
visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within...

                      JOHN

          It's a hole in space. A doorway.

                      WEST

          A doorway to where?

                      JOHN

          If we want to reach that ship, we're
          going to have to find out.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two flies through the pulsing hole in space.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The giant, silver ship looms in the windscreen.

                      MAUREEN

          No apparent effects on the ship.

          I'm hailing on all frequencies. No
          response.

                      JOHN

          There are some markings on the
          starboard side. Can you throw some
          light on her?

                      WEST

          Don't know if the exterior spots are
          working.- There we go.

THE WINDSCREEN-CLOSE. Powerful spotlights hit the ship.

WEST AND JOHN-CLOSE. And really surprised.

                      WEST

          If this in all a dream, why can't
          there be more girls?

THE SPACESHIP-CLOSE. Essentially a needle covered with metal scallops.
On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag.

                      WEST

          I've never seen a design like this.
          what are those scales on her hull?

                      JOHN

          How could Earth launch a ship this
          massive and neither of us know about
          it? ... It just doesn't make sense.

                      WEST

          These scanners are damaged, I'm
          getting inconsistent life signs but
          they may be sensor ghosts.

                      JOHN

          Maybe her computer's still up. I'm
          trying standard remote access codes.

ON SCREEN-A docking ring on the giant ship comes to life, giant floods
coming to life, the docking aperture rotating open.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      JOHN

          Can you give me some light on the
          secondary docking ring?

A smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen.

                      WEST

          What do you make of that?

Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft. Its
snaking anthropomorphic lines are not of human design.

                      MAUREEN

          Boys, I think we're having a close
          encounter.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a giant THUD as the Jupiter Two docks with the probe.

                      ROBOT (OVER)

          Crush.

REVERSE ANGLE. The Robot in rolling in through the doorway, arms
waving wildly before him.

                      ROBOT

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Don and John are up fast. But the Robot just rolls to a stop. Will
steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand.

He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.

                      WILL

          Crush. Kill. Destroy.

                      ROBOT

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.

                      WILL

          I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his
          main operating system and accessed
          his sub-routines. He's basically
          running on remote control.

All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.

                      PENNY

          Show off.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-CREW QUARTERS-LATER

Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.

                      PENNY

          And so the Space Captive finds
          herself helping the Robinsons by
          guarding the traitor. And she finds-

Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.

                      PENNY

          She finds that out here, in the dark
          and cold, she's scared, and she's
          kind of glad they're all together.

Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.

                      PENNY

          Identify yourself, soldier.

                      WEST

          West, Major, United Space Force,
          requesting permission to see the
          prisoner.

Penny steps aside.

                      PENNY

          Proceed Major West.

Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door.

                      PENNY

          Ouch. Could he be cuter? I don't
          think so.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

Actually a med-lab. Smith turns to face Don an he ENTERS.

                      SMITH

          These quarters are totally
          unacceptable. I demand-

Don tosses his bundle on the seat. A silver flight suit.

                      WEST

          We're going to check out the probe
          ship. Maybe we can figure out how
          they got here. And how to get home.

                      SMITH

          Ta-ta. Have a wonderful trip.

                      WEST

          You're coming with us.

                      SMITH

          Out of the question. I'm a doctor not
          a space explorer. You and-

But Don is in his face in a heartbeat.

                      WEST

          What you are is a murderous saboteur
          and I am not leaving you on this ship
          so you can do more harm than you've
          already caused.

                      SMITH

          I absolutely refuse-

                      WEST

          (closer)

          Give me an excuse to kill you.
          Please.

Smith stares at him a beat. Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit.

                      SMITH

          Silver always was my color.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS

Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean.

                      WILL

          When boarding a mysterious
          spacecraft, it always pays to look
          your best.

John enters, removes a gun from the weapons locker.

                      JOHN

          Deactivate safety.

                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed. Rifle is
          active.

GUN-CLOSE. A small light goes from red to green.

                      JOHN

          You did a good job up there son. You
          saved us all.

                      WILL

          Thanks.

An awkward silence hangs between them.

                      JOHN

          I know I haven't around much these
          days.That we haven't had time to-

                      WEST (OVER)

          Professor, we're ready.

John looks at his boy Will in silent.

                      JOHN

          Will, you're the most important thing
          in the world to me. I hope one day
          you'll be able to see that.

With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.

                      WILL

          Take care of my dad, okay Robot?

Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens
to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the
docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.

                      JUDY

          The air is stale. Old.

                      SMITH

          That's the smell of ghosts.

Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.

                      WEST

          I'm interfacing with the on board
          computer... Odd.

                      JOHN

          Not working?

                      WEST

          No, it's just, I don't know, too
          fast. Most of the systems are down.

The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More
lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.

                      JUDY

          Motion sensors are still working.

                      WEST (OVER)

          What do you make of this?

Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.

                      JOHN

          Some kind of hieroglyphics.

WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.
The sketches tell a story.

HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.

SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter
the giant ship.

THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts
many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red
substance. Don touches the stain.

CHAPTER 13: Exploration
-----------------------


                      JUDY

          If I didn't know better I'd say this
          is blood.

                      SMITH

          I know an omen when I see one. I
          suggest a hasty retreat.

                      WEST

          Just imagine we're retreating in the
          opposite direction. Now, move it.

Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group
heading deeper into the quiet ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton
forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume
control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.

                      WILL

          Dad, do you....

INT.-PROBE SHIP

                      ROBOT

          ... Hear something?

The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now
DRIPPING can be heard by all.

                      SMITH

          Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..

                      WEST

          You really need to shut up.

                      JOHN

          (pointing)

          Here.

THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous
membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane
DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.

                      JUDY

          That material appears biological.

                      SMITH

          Nothing good will come of this.

                      WEST

          What makes you such an expert?

                      SMITH

          Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.

                      JOHN

          Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can
          get some answers.

They head off. HOLD on the dripping membrane.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel.

Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser
welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry.

                      PENNY

          Try it now, Mom.

Maureen throws a switch. The panel lights up, then goes dead.

                      PENNY

          Damn.

INT.-SHIP-WALKING

The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a
wall panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...

INT.-MAIN BRIDGE

Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been
blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.

                      JUDY

          What the hell happened in here?

                      WEST

          Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
          technology. I've seen some of this
          before. On the drawing boards.

Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.
Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.

John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.

                      JOHN

          Can you bring up the Captain's log?

                      WEST

          The data has degraded. I'm going try
          and gather any fragments I can. There
          isn't much, but ... here we go.

MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's
Jab. But his hair is grey.

                      WEST

          Jeb.

                      JEB

          The hyperspace tracker seems to be
          functioning...

          (static)

          No sign of the Jupiter Two...

                      JEB

          (static)

          Have exceeded our mission timetable
          by two...

          (static)

          I'm not willing to give up. Don would
          keep looking for me.

                      WEST

          That's it. The rest of the data is
          totally corrupted.

IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips
it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.

                      WEST

          This doesn't make sense. How could
          they launch a rescue mission for us
          when we've only been lost a day?

Judy stands by the life sciences panel.

                      JUDY

          I've got something here.

A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image
of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.

                      JUDY

          They brought it up from the planet's
          surface. It's seems to be some sort
          of egg sack.

Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.

                      WEST

          Smith, step away from there.

                      SMITH

          Happy to oblige, Major. Although I
          don't think it's me you should be
          worrying about. But rather this.

In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.

                      WILL

          I'm detecting motion. Behind you...

INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE

A towering SHADOW shoots past the open doorway.

                      JOHN

          After it. Move.

          (to the Robot)

          Bring Smith.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR

Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering
plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.

THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from
behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.

Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to
a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.

INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB

A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.

                      WEST

          This explains where all the plants
          came from.

                      JUDY

          Growth like this would take decades.

The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.

                      SMITH

          Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.

                      WEST

          Don't move.

                      SMITH

          I am sick of your terrorism. If you
          are going to kill me, be done with
          it. Otherwise I will insist you treat
          me with the respect and-

                      WEST

          (like steel)

          I said don't move.

Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's
head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he
pulls from its hiding place a small creature.

About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf
color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales
of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.

                      WILL

          Neat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN

West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more
friendly blue. Judy approaches.

                      JUDY

          Well, who do we have here?

As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,
trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.

                      WEST

          Easy there, little buddy. No one's
          going to hurt you.

                      SMITH

          How do you know it won't hurt us?

Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small
beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.

                      JUDY

          Looks like you've made a friend. You
          have a good bedside manner, Major.

                      WEST

          I'm going to let that one go.

                      SMITH

          How charming. Doctor Dolittle of
          outer space.

                      JUDY

          Where do you think it came from?

                      JOHN

          It's possible this is one of the
          creatures represented in the
          hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It
          must have been their ship attached to
          the other docking ring.

The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,
burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.

                      WEST

          It looks like a child.

                      SMITH

          If so, my dear Major, what do you
          suppose happened to its parents?

                      JOHN

          Let's get back to the bridge.

As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the
background. Ominous. Unseen.

CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders!
--------------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO

Penny is still hanging overhead.

                      PENNY

          I think I've got it.

The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status
lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor.

                      MAUREEN

          That's strange.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with
ambient heat. Penny lands beside her.

                      PENNY

          Those scales are giving off heat.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

John is at the Com.

                      JOHN

          I've tapped into the internal sensor
          array. Besides us, this ship is
          totally deserted.

                      SMITH

          A ghost ship.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his
pocket. Turns it over in his hand.

                      WEST

          And the flavor of the day is ...
          banana/beef. Who thinks up these
          combinations?

The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,
sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.

                      WEST

          MM. Good.

                      SMITH

          Major West, I highly recommend you
          never breed. That by the way is my
          medical opinion.

Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature
looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes
widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack.

                      WEST

          Little thing was hungry.

                      SMITH

          Good Lord, who will - spare us the
          tyranny of the sentimental?

(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE.

                      PENNY

          Do you hear something?

Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,
clinging to his neck for dear life.

                      SMITH

          Get this infernal creature off me.

The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.

THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the
hole seems to be trembling.

                      WEST

          This can't be good.

                      SMITH

          You have a remarkably keen sense
          of the obvious.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station.

                      MAUREEN

          John, get the hell out of there.

ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are
beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs.

EXT.-PROBE SHIP

Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor
plated spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and
push through, vanishing into the probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck.

                      MAUREEN

          Give me an external view.

Penny works the console.

ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE

The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A
shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling.

What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of
a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend.
A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.

Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the
metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its
limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell.

                      JOHN

          Evacuate. Now!

The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the
hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards
our fleeing heros.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS

The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding
after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.

                      WILL

          This joy stick is too slow. Activate
          holographic interface.

A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the
image now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing.

INT.-PROBE SHIP

The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it
can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.

The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing
the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.

But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor
ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.

Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.

                      JUDY

          They eat their wounded.

Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions.
Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them.

                      JOHN

          Which way?

INT. -JUPITER TWO

WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph.

                      WILL

          Turn left.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR

                      ROBOT

          Now right.

The spiders are swarming, closing fast.

                      JOHN

          Got to seal the bulkhead.

                      WEST

          The door control is at the other and
          of the corridor.

                      JUDY

          The fire sensor.

Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the
corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders.

DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel.

Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in,
the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.

The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the
spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour
through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling
towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.

                      SMITH

          Open, damn you.

                      WEST

          It's cycling a vacuum check. There is
          no way to speed up the protocols.

                      SMITH

          Fools. I warned you not to come
          aboard this cursed craft. You've
          killed us. You've killed us all.

Judy throws him, hard, into the wall.

                      JUDY

          Shut up.

                      WEST

          Now that's a bedside manner.

The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is
within the holograph, fighting off the spiders.

                      WILL

          Charge.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling.

The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside.

                      JOHN

          Will, get the Robot in here.

The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs
shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna
spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by.

                      WILL

          I can't move him without letting the
          spiders into the ship.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

                      JOHN

          Leave him behind.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WILL

          I'm sorry, Robot.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY

A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic
body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK

                      JOHN

          Seal it. Now!

Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the
dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon.

SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision.

THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the
airlock.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in.

                      JOHN

          Get us out of here.

Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries
separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey.

                      SMITH

          Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.

He throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the
wall, SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles.

John has strapped in beside Don.

                      JOHN

          Get me an external view.

A MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping
onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull.

                      JOHN

          Prepare to disengage.

THE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her
head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap.

                      PENNY

          Get it off me. Get it off.

Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature
on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny.

Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the
ship is now entirely covered with spiders.

                      WEST

          Initiating separation.

LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its
head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast.

                      PENNY

          It's okay. Everything's going to be
          alright.

But she sounds anything but sure.

                      WEST

          We're clear. Everybody hang on.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The Jupiter Two's engines BLOW, peeling into the endless night.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

(OVER) ALARMS sound.

                      JUDY

          I think those things were using the
          probe ship as a way to trap food.

                      WEST

          That I s probably what happened to
          the monkey's parents. We were going
          to be desert.

                      MAUREEN

          But what happened to the crew?

                      JOHN

          Nothing good.

                      WEST

          We're not out of the woods yet.

ON SCREEN. The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant
spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull.

                      WEST

          Let's see how these monsters like a
          hundred thousand volts.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their
limbs and heads retracting.

                      WEST

          And the crowd goes wild.

                      SMITH

          Recall your nightmares from
          childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely
          so easily dissuaded.

(OVER) a THUNK. Then another. A third.

ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the
Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to
burrow once more.

                      WEST

          Persistent bastards.

                      JOHN

          Can you hit them again?

                      WEST

          Every time I electrify the hull, I'm
          draining our systems. Once or twice
          more and we're going to be dead in
          space.

                      SMITH

          A fate I fear may be inevitable one
          way or another.

Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in
metal tongs. Carries it to her life sciences analyzer.

                      JOHN

          That's the same expression you had
          when my mother came to stay with us.

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A graphic of the severed spider leg. A small
line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. Musculature and
flesh are drawn in on the screen.

                      MAUREEN

          DNA extrapolation - coming up.
          Silicone based. Admantium shell and
          lack of respiratory system suggest an
          ability to live in deep space. Tiny
          front brain implies communal
          relationships. More like bees.

VIEWS CREEN -CLOSE. More and more spider are spiraling from the probe
ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two.

                      WEST

          There are thousands of those things

Maureen is working the COMPUTER.

                      MAUREEN

          They may be attracted to heat and
          light.

Don begins typing.

                      WEST

          With the right command codes, I can
          light up the probe ship from here.

MONITOR-CLOSE. More spiders are hitting the bull.

                      WEST

          Damn. No response.

                      JOHN

          Command codes are sequenced. Try the next series.

                      WEST

          But they won't work until the next
          fleet of ships are built. That's at
          least two years away.

                      JOHN

          Just do it.

Don begins entering command codes.

The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they
begin their initial BURN.

                      WEST

          How did you know?

                      JOHN

          Think about it, Don. The ships's
          advanced technology. Your friend
          looking old. What if that ship is
          from our future?

                      COMPUTER

          Warning. Outer hull has been
          compromised.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Spiders are eating through the outer hull.

                      MAUREEN

          It's not working.

                      JOHN

          Can you get the fusion drive on line?

EXT.-SPACE

THE PROBE SHIP'S fusion drives FIRE. A few of the spiders divert back
toward the probe ship. But most still head for the Jupiter.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          Let's turn up the heat.

Don engages the THRUSTERS, grabs the throttle.

EXT.-SPACE

The Jupiter Two banks toward the probe ship, heading directly for the
wake of the fusion drives.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      COMPUTER (OVER)

          Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty
          seconds.

                      JOHN

          Give them a little encouragement.

                      WEST

          Electrifying outer hull ... now.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The outer bull flashes with electricity, the spiders jumping off. Don
pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive.

The spiders jump off, begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of
the giant probe ship.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

ON SCREEN the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the
giant probe ship.

                      JOHN

          Get us out of here. Fast.

Don looks at John a beat, then he begins working the controls.

                      JOHN

          What are you doing?

                      WEST

          Never leave an enemy stronghold
          intact. One of your father's first
          rules of engagement.

Don hits a button. On the remote control console a readout begins to
flash. The message is simple: FUSION DRIVE-OVERLOAD.

                      JOHN

          Don, stop. That's a direct order. We
          might need to salvage-

                      WEST

          This is a military emergency. That
          means I'm in command.

                      JOHN

          Don, no. I'm ordering you-

                      WEST

          I hate spiders.

Don hits a button. The panel light flashes: OVERLOAD.

                      WEST

          Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy
          ride.

Don angles the ship away, punching the thrusters as the probe ship's
engines begins to glow.

EXT.-SPACE

The probe ship's nuclear core overloads. The engines begin to glow,
venting plasma and then EXPLODE like a nascent star.

THE BLAST WAVE spreads across space, vaporizing the spiders.

THE BLAST WAVE hits the Jupiter Two.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is buffeted by the shock wave.

                      WEST

          I can't hold her.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Don is struggling to keep control.

                      WEST

          We're going down.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship is hurling toward the planet's cloud obscured surface.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The windscreen is filled with a RUSHING BLIZZARD.

                      WEST

          Can't get the stabilizers on line.

                      JOHN

          Pull up. Pull up.

                      WEST

          Really? No kidding? Thanks.

WINDSCREEN- CLOSE. The storm clouds suddenly PART TO REVEAL ... A
GIANT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN RANGE.

Don banks the controls.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship tilts on its side, passing between two snowy peaks, still
plunging towards the planet's wintry surface below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          I'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm
          going to try and make it.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two BLOWS over a carpet of snowy treetops, the canopy of
leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The surface is coming up fast.

                      WEST

          Got to slow us down.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE

The Jupiter Two hits the surf ace of the water and skips, once twice,
three times across the alien sea.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          Brace for impact!

The ship SMASHES into a crater miles long, PLOWING through rock and
vegetation, finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

Still. Automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere. only the dimmest
emergency lights cast any glow.

                      JOHN

          Everybody, by the numbers.

Maureen straightens, rubs her neck.

                      MAUREEN

          Life Sciences, still breathing.

                      JUDY

          Me too. Robotics, I mean.

                      PENNY

          Video Mechanics, okay.

                      SMITH

          I'm alive, Major West's poor excuse
          for piloting skills not withstanding.

                      WEST

          Let's take a look.

Don hits a switch, the windshield de-icing, becoming clear.

                      PENNY

          I don't think we're in Kansas
          anymore.

REVERSE ANGLE

Before them lies the crater, snow covered floor spreading out towards
a distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns.

CHAPTER 15: Follow Orders!
--------------------------


EXT. -ALIEN LANDSCAPE-NIGHT

The moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield. The
Jupiter Two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting
the otherworldly darkness.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          You violated a direct order.

INT.-ENGINE ROOM

Cavernous. John and Don stand by the giant drive engines. Don is
holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing
with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal.

                      WEST

          About half the core material is
          burned out. We'll never generate
          enough power to break orbit.

                      JOHN

          I told you not to blow that ship's
          reactors and you did it anyway.

                      WEST

          Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I
          was technically still in command.

                      JOHN

          Don't hand me that. I'm commander of
          this mission.

                      WEST

          Look, no offense, but you're an
          egghead with an honorary rank. No one
          ever intended you to handle combat
          situations. You're spouting some
          nonsense about- time travel while
          those spiders posed a continuing
          threat. I made a judgement call and
          if I have to I'll make it again.
          Hell, you of all people should
          understand that. If your father were
          here-

                      JOHN

          My father is not here. My father is
          dead, killed in one of his combat
          missions you so admire. My family is
          on this ship And you're going to
          follow my orders. Whether you agree
          with them or not. Is that clear,
          Major?

Don's face is right up in John's.

                      WEST

          Save the speeches. I like you. But
          the fate of the Earth is at stake
          here. I'm going to do whatever I
          think it takes to ensure the success
          of this mission. With or without your
          help. Is that clear, Professor?

The two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight. Kissing seems
less than likely.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Am I interrupting something?

WIDER. Maureen stands in the doorway.

                      MAUREEN

          No. Really. I think you two should go
          ahead and slug it out. I mean, here
          we are stranded on an alien world and
          you boys want to get into a pissing
          contest. So please, go for it. I'll
          have Judy down here in a heartbeat to
          declare you both unfit and I'll take
          over this mission. Now I don't want
          to hear another word from you two
          until you can play nice. Is that
          clear?

                      JOHN WEST

          Maureen- Listen-

                      MAUREEN

          Not another word.

          (a beat)

          Better. Now if you've finished hosing
          down the decks with testosterone, I
          suggest you come with me. I may have
          found a way to get us off this
          planet.

Maureen turns on her heal and EXITS. The two men exchange a look.

                      WEST

          Wow.

                      JOHN

          Tell me about it.

They head after her.

          Affirmative.

                      WILL

          I guess sometimes friendship means
          acting with your heart, not your
          head.

                      ROBOT

          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

                      WILL

          Don't worry, Robot. Im going to build
          you a new body. I promise.

Will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of
the ship. He lifts a circular bubble of diodes. Smiles.

Maureen stands at her life sciences station with John and Don.

                      MAUREEN

          The atmosphere here can sustain human
          life. I've located 500 Rads
          radioactive material a mile north.

                      JOHN

          That's at least what we'd need to get

John looks out the viewscreen at the alien night. Turns to Don.

                      JOHN

          We'll set off at daybreak. it'll be

          What's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it
          cowboy or ballerina on Halloween?

                      JUDY

          Right now she's a girl. But I think
          your little pal here is from a
          self-replicating species. At
          different stages of life she, or he,
          probably alternates sexes.

                      PENNY

          Imagine the savings on dating outfits
          alone.

The tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner.

                      PENNY

          Please. She's all alone. I promise
          I'll look after her. She needs me.

                      JUDY

          ...The moment you misplace her, or
          forget to feed her, we leave her on
          this planet where she can live in the
          wild. I'm not kidding Penny.

And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature.

                      PENNY

          We're both a long way from home,
          aren't we little one?

The creature makes a tiny BLIP.

                      PENNY

          That's what we'll call you. Blip.

Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist.

                      PENNY

          You like that?

Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks
up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek.

                      PENNY

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying
to imitate Penny's words of comfort.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling.

CHAPTER 16: Alien World
-----------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB

Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed
security panel in the wall.

                      SMITH

          Remove that lock this instant. I
          shall not be caged like some animal

                      WEST

          (lethal)

          I gave my word I'd let you live. I
          never said for how long.

                      SMITH

          These quarters will be fine.

Smith stares at him a beat.

                      SMITH

          Tell me, Major West. Are you really
          confident in Robinson's ability to
          guide us? If I were set free, I would
          support your right to command. With
          minimal force, we could take this
          ship and assure this mission
          continues under your leadership.

                      WEST

          ...My God Smith, you're right. How
          could I have been so blind? I'll just
          run and get you a gun so we can
          hijack the ship. Okay?

                      SMITH

          Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak
          mind.

                      WEST

          I'm hiding the pain. Really.

And with that West leaves.

Smith tries the door. Locked. Then, from one cuff of his field suit,
be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship.

                      SMITH

          I assure you, Major West. Your pain
          has just begun.

Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an
impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt.

PAN DOWN. HOLD on SMITH'S BACK. Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny
tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales.

INT. -BRIDGE-NIGHT

Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal,
sipping water, staring out into the alien night.

                      WEST (OVER)

          Star light, star bright...

                      JUDY

          A million strange stars and only one
          wish. I wish we were home.

Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her.

                      JUDY

          I never thought a sky could look so
          alien. ...We really are lost.

                      WEST

          When the first sailors circled the
          globe and saw a brand new sky, they
          thought they had sailed off the edge
          of the earth. But they were really
          just around the corner.

                      JUDY

          (smiles)

          We just billow our sails and let the
          wind blow us home, Is that it Major?

                      WEST

          So those sailors found familiar
          shapes in the stars to make the skies
          more friendly, to help them find
          their way.

Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. MONITOR-CLOSE. It shows
the star-field above. He lifts a light-tipped stylus.

                      WEST

          That's how constellations were born.

Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a
children's book. Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.

                      WEST

          Porky the wise and mighty Pig.

Judy LAUGHS. She takes the stylus. Begins to draw.

                      JUDY

          The great bucktoothed Bunny... Bugs.

Don smiles. Judy can't help but smile back. Their faces are close.

                      WEST

          So, my quarters or yours?

                      JUDY

          Excuse me?

                      WEST

          We are the only single man and woman
          of consenting age in the galaxy. How
          much more of a set up do you need?

                      JUDY

          So you figure just dispense with the
          pleasantries, get down to business?

                      WEST

          You have a way with words, Doctor.

                      JUDY

          (provocative)

          Right here? On this console?

Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.

                      WEST

          Here would be fine.

Judy smiles sweetly.

DON-CLOSE. Lips parting. Suddenly water begins to pour down over his
head. His eyes open wide. Judy holds her empty glass in hand.

                      JUDY

          Next time, fly slower.

She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow.

INT.-JOHN & MAUREEN'S QUARTERS

Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John
activates the automated security systems.

                      JOHN

          What was I thinking, bringing us all
          out here into space?

                      MAUREEN

          The world needed saving. You were the
          right man for the job.

                      JOHN

          But solving the world's problems
          doesn't leave much time for the
          people you love, does it?

                      MAUREEN

          Did you get any time with Will?

                      JOHN

          Now he's decided he can rebuild the
          robot. Wants to show me his designs.
          I've got too much to do-

                      MAUREEN

          Funny creatures, men. You try so hard
          not to be your fathers, end up making
          the same mistakes. Will adores you.
          He needs your attention.

                      JOHN

          We can't get off this planet much
          less back on course. I don't have
          time to...

                      MAUREEN

          John, just listen to him. it doesn't
          matter what he's saying. Just listen.
          Sometimes, at least in the eyes of
          their fathers, little boys have to
          come first.

                      JOHN

          As soon as we get back into space,
          we're going to spend some real time
          together. I promise.

Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.

                      JOHN

          What?

                      MAUREEN

          It's nice to have our family under
          one roof. Even if we had to go half
          way across the galaxy to manage it.

John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked
orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles.

                      JOHN

          How would you feel about a little
          late night tutorial, Professor?

John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME.

                      MAUREEN

          Mm. That's new. What are you doing?

                      JOHN

          Going for extra credit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT

The ship sits on the alien landscape.

                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Good night John.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Good night Maureen.

                      WILL (OVER)

          Good night Judy.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Good night Will.

                      JUDY (OVER)

          Good night Penny.

                      WEST (OVER)

          You guys have got to be kidding.

CHAPTER 17: The Core
--------------------


INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING

Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the
morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen.

WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.

                      WILL

          Oh man.

REVERSE ANGLE

A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.
Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.

INT.-BRIEFING ROOM

The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.

                      PENNY

          What are those rumblings? They've
          been happening all morning.

                      JUDY

          How can half the landscape have grown
          up overnight?

                      JOHN

          Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates
that make up this world appear mismatched.

                      MAUREEN

          It's impossible. But this planet's
          geothermic plates don't match up.

                      JOHN

          I was afraid of this.

Al1 eyes turn to John.

                      JOHN

          I think these tremors are the result
          of opening and closing doorways.

                      PENNY

          Doorways to where?

                      JOHN

          The future.

                      SMITH

          Perhaps the Professor was hit on the
          head when we landed.

                      JOHN

          Remember the portal that lead us to
          the probe ship? What if we crossed a
          into a time years after Earth sent a
          rescue mission.

                      WEST

          You're not serious? Time travel is
          impossible.

                      WILL

          No it's not. It's just improbable.
          Like hyperdrive was a hundred years
          ago. Nothing's really impossible.

                      JOHN

          This world could be riddled with
          doorways to the future.

                      WILL

          So if we walk into that forest
          outside, we're really just walking
          into this crater years from now.

                      MAUREEN

          Geological plates from different
          times wouldn't fit together. That
          would explain the tectonic mismatch.
          But doorways in time, John?

                      JOHN

          If these portals are opening and
          closing, part of some cascading,
          natural phenomenon, they could be
          tearing this planet apart

                      WILL

          These portals are exactly what I
          predicted my time machine would do.
          What if the doorways aren't natural?
          A machine that bends space, like our
          hyperdrive, could be modified to bend
          time as well. What if someone on this
          world has built a device?

                      JOHN

          Son, I appreciate your input but now
          isn't the time for flights of fancy.

                      WILL

          You never listen to me. Not ever.

And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely
wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.

                      JOHN

          There's no telling how long before
          this planet breaks up entirely.

          (rising).

          Don and I are going to locate the
          radioactive material for the core.
          Get the ship ready to go. We may have
          very little time.

INT. -BRIDGE

John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will
sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.

                      JOHN

          Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?

Will just shakes his head.

                      WILL

          You're always leaving. What if...

Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.

                      WILL

          What if one time you don't come
          home...

John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep
and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.

                      JOHN

          Whenever your grandfather went away
          on a mission, held leave these with
          me. For safe keeping. And when he got
          home I d always be waiting to give
          them back.

He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.

                      JOHN

          I'm coming back Will. I promise.

Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.
Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the
ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.

                      WEST

          I've got a fix on the radioactive
          material. It's through the portal.

                      JOHN

          We'll just have to hope the doorways
          remain stable.

                      JUDY

          These crater walls are disabling the
          com-links. You won't be able to
          communicate with the ship.

(OVER) the ground shakes again.

                      Maureen

          Come home to me, Professor.

                      JOHN

          I love you, wife.

John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.

                      JUDY

          I'm going to regret saying this, But
          try to get back in one piece.

                      WEST

          This is kind of a kiss for luck
          occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?

                      JUDY

          See. I'm regretting it already.

          (coy)

          Kisses have to be earned. Say
          goodbye, Blip.

Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough
approximation of the words Penny taught her.

                      BLIP

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

                      JOHN

          You take care of her, Penny.

          (kisses her head)

          Take care of you too, baby.

Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Smith stares out the cabin window. PUSH IN as

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

                      SMITH

          Yes, enjoy your moments of trite
          familial bonding.

He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift
lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification.

                      SMITH

          Because they will be your last.

INT.-WILL'S CABIN

The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in
the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.

Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips,
and other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.

                      PENNY

          That's everything even close to
          nonessential. Even my bellybutton
          ring.

                      WILL

          Thanks, Pen.

                      PENNY

          You want to come on a land survey?

But Will just shakes his head, sulky.

                      PENNY

          Look, what does dad know? Maybe
          someone did build a time machine.

She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.

                      ROBOT

          Robot is on line.

(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.

                      WILL

          It sounds like old morse code.


Chapter 18: Danger Will!
------------------------


INT.-CORRIDOR

Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will
follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.

Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table,
hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.

Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.

                      WILL

          (sounding out the code)

          Danger.

INT.-SMITH'S CELL

The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.

                      WILL

          You said someone is in danger.

                      SMITH

          We all are. You are wise to arm
          yourself.

Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.

                      WILL

          This gun is set to fire for me only
          so don't try anything funny.

Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going
instead to the window and opening the blast shield.

                      SMITH

          William, you misjudge me. I only want
          to help you.

                      WILL

          Help us? You tried to kill us all.

                      SMITH

          But now our fates are intertwined. if
          your father and that idiot West fail,
          I will have no chance of getting
          home. It is in my best interests they
          succeed. And I always follow my best
          interests.

Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.

                      SMITH

          What monsters roam these alien wilds?
          Fools. To set off blindly across this
          savage land. Much as I hate to admit
          it, it will be harder to manage
          without them.

                      WILL

          What are you talking about? They'll
          be back. They'll be okay.

Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.

                      WILL

          Someone should go after them.

                      SMITH

          Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A
          clever one, certainly, but a child
          nonetheless. This planet is likely
          full of predators. Even if you found
          them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,
          dying, what good could you do?

                      WILL

          But you're a doctor.

Smith turns away, hiding his smile.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY

Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater
wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.

                      JUDY

          It's impossible.

                      MAUREEN

          Not really. Geologists have
          speculated that Dimondium might be
          naturally occurring in many older
          worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of
          rejuvenating itself.

                      JUDY

          This one is ten times more powerful
          then that on Alpha Prime. There's
          enough here to save Earth.

Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,
talking into her video recorder.

                      PENNY

          After much deliberation, the Space
          Captive has decided to accept her new
          role as member of the crew. The
          Robinsons, after all, can  obviously
          use her help...

Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.

                      PENNY

          (flaring)

          Now look what you've done. Stop
          hanging all over me.

Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the
edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick
brush..

                      PENNY

          Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.

Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.


CHAPTER 19: A Different Future
------------------------------


EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY

Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
tracker in his hand.

                      WILL

          I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
moving in the wind like an azure sea.

                      WILL

          Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.

                      SMITH

          How droll.

(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the
distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.

                      SMITH

          Run, child, run.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

                      SMITH

          Will? Will?

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.

                      WILL

          Wow!

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.

                      SMITH

          William, wait!

                      WILL

          See, over here I'm in the future.

(steps back towards Smith)

          Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
          If my theories are correct, these
          doorways should remain stable, for
          a while anyway.

                      SMITH

          I can barely contain my glee. Why
          aren't you aging like the plants?

                      WILL

          That's just an effect of the portals
          forming. Once they stabilize you can
          cross from one time to another
          just like stepping between two
          rooms.

          (off his tracker)

          Dad's signal is this way. Come on,
          Doctor Smith.

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.

                      WILL (OVER)

          What did you find?

Will has returned.

                      SMITH

          Come, come, son, no time for
          distractions. Let's move on.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.
Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES

John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the
crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.

                      JOHN

          Damn.

                      WEST

          Damn? Damn is not good.

                      JOHN

          The radiation signature we've been
          tracking. it's a  ghost. A
          reflection from the Jupiter Two
          bouncing off the ore in these walls.
          There's no core material here.

(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time
portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees,
roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker,
more deserted future.

                      JOHN

          The ship's back that way. we have to
          go through.

EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT

Penny is pushing through the forest.

                      PENNY

          Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?

She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the
ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip
is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker,
the sky red. Blip steps through the portal.

                      PENNY

          Blip, wait.

Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall
trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs
and caverns cut into the crater wall.

BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,
CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.

                      PENNY

          Blip, you can't run off like that.

(closing on the stone)

          What the-?

THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant
rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship.

HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.

                      PENNY (OVER)

          Some kind of fight, in space. It
          almost looks like the probe ship
          Major West blew up.

HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.

                      PENNY

          That could be the Jupiter Two crash
          landing.

HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single
lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.

                      PENNY

          Blip, no!

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The
beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't
resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her
wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.

                      GIANT BLIP

          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.


                      JOHN

          We should be able to see the ship.

Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches
down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.

                      WEST

          Could these be from the probe?

                      JOHN

          Corroded. This metal is decades old.

Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.

                      WEST

          It's not possible.

WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.

                      WEST

          What kind of nightmare is this?
          Where the hell are we?

                      JOHN

          No, Major, when the hell are we?

Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.
John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a
rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful
electrical blast, falling hard. Still.

REVERSE ANGLE

Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and
apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.

EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given
way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.

                      WILL

          I feel like we got turned around.

                      SMITH

          Just follow your father's signal,
          young William.

                      WILL

          Oh shit.

                      SMITH

          A boy of your intelligence shouldn't
          swear.

                      WILL

          (pointing)

          Look.

                      SMITH

          Oh. Shit, indeed.

REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of
the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open
to the sun.


                                                               CUT TO:

JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness.

WIDER

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers
Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is
slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.

                      VOICE (OVER)

          Well, well. All things really do
          come to he who waits.

A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.

                      JOHN

          What is this place?

                      FIGURE

          Why Professor, the shock must have
          scrambled your brain. Look around
          you. Don't you recognize the spot?
          You've come home.

                      JOHN

          This can't be...

But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.

                      JOHN

          What have you done to the ship.
          ...Where's my family?

                      FIGURE

          Your family is dead. Dead and in the
          ground.

                      JOHN

          No!

                      FIGURE

          What fickle consort in memory. Time
          dims certain images while others
          shine clear and bright as yesterday.

The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond
hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.

                      FIGURE

          I'll never forget that morning.
          Twenty years ago. What was it you
          said? I'll be back. I promise. But I
          knew better. You never came home.

The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.

                      FIGURE

          Without you, your family never had a
          chance. A few spidersv survived the
          destruction of the probe ship. They
          reached the planet and attacked. I
          can still hear the women scream.

                      JOHN

          Who are you?

The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then
he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but
familiar. John's father's dog tags.

                      FIGURE

          Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's
          me. I'm your son. Will.

EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY

Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush.

                      JUDY

          Penny? Penny?

The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.

                      MAUREEN

          Penny? Baby, are you alright?

Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,
their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.

                      PENNY

          It's okay, Mom. They're not going to
          hurt us. it's like  they think I'm
          their princess or something.


                                                               CUT TO:

EXT.-CRATER CAVES -EVENING-FLITURE

Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes
the images graven into the giant stone.

                      JUDY

          Best as I can tell this whole clan
          was spawned by this single creature.

          (to the beast)

          We've been a busy girl haven't we?
          But...

                      MAUREEN

          Speak, doctor.

                      JUDY

          Each creature seems to have unique
          corpuscular patterns on their palms.
          As individual an fingerprints, no
          two alike. Except...

                      MAUREEN

          Except the prints on this giant
          creature and our little Blip
          match exactly. Don't they?

                      JUDY

          How did you know?

                      MAUREEN

          Because, I think Blip and our friend
          here are actually one and the same.

Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other,
follows Older Will into the giant room.

                      OLDER WILL

          Father, I give you ... eternity.

                      WIDER

War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor
above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by
the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards
the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within
the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.

A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the
bubble. At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a
single laser down into the center of the bubble.

                      WEST

          (coming to)

          . . .ouch. Who ordered me that last
          drink? What the hell is going on?

                      JOHN

          I think we crossed into our own
          future. We've come back to the
          Jupiter Two decades after we left.

                      OLDER WILL

          Look father, what my flights of
          fancy have wrought. I used your
          hypergate to build my time machine.

Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.

                      OLDER WILL

          Over the years I have struggled in
          vain to harness the awesome power of
          time. All my experiments at creating
          a stable doorway have been futile.
          Until now. Today you will witness my
          ultimate triumph.

Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of
core material incrementally descending into the console.

                      WEST

          The core material. if we could get
          that back to our Jupiter Two...

                      JOHN

          The doorways in time that led us
          here must be a side effect of his
          machine coming on line. Like streams
          running into the ocean....

                      OLDER WILL

          Once this core material in fully
          introduced into the control console,
          I will open a doorway stable enough
          for one person to take one trip
          through time and space as well.
          Today, I will change history.

Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The
laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into
the bubble images begins to stabilize. Images of Earth.

                      OLDER WILL

          I will return home, to the very day
          you took us on this cursed mission.
          I'll stop us from taking off. I'll
          do what you never could. I'll save
          the family. I'll save us all.

                      JOHN

          Look around. Your machine is ripping           this planet
apart. What if the force
          wave you ride home has the same
          effect on Earth? What if, in getting
          home, you destroy Earth in the
          process?

A beat. Then Will turns away, goes back to work.

                      OLDER WILL

          I'm going home. I'm going to save
          the family.

                      JOHN

          Will, I'm your father. You've got to
          listen to me-.

                      OLDER WILL

          Let me tell you about my father. My
          father was a walking ghost. Never
          there when I needed him. He dragged
          his family into deep dark space and
          lost them there. My father is not
          coming to the rescue.

CHAPTER 20: Spiders Sting
-------------------------


EXT.-ALIEN PLAnet-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship. Smith puts his hand
on the boy's arm, holding him back.

                      WILL

          We've got to go inside.

                      SMITH

          Slow down, now. We can't know what
          waits inside that ravaged craft. But
          we can be confidant it is nothing
          good. And I for one am frightened.

                      WILL

          But Dad's in there.

                      SMITH

          Will, listen to me. I have crossed
          this world with you, found your
          father as promised. But I can't let
          you go in there unarmed.

                      WILL

          But I've got a gun.

                      SMITH

          If we go forward, the barer of that
          weapon must be ready to kill. Murder
          is a skill, one which I have
          developed and, luckily dear boy, you
          have not. Look inside your heart,
          Will. Are you truly capable of
          taking a life? If not, then I ask
          you now, put your faith in me. Give
          me your trust. Give me that gun.

Will stares him. Pulls free the pistol. Thumbs the lock pad.

                      WILL

          Enable gun for all users.


                      GUN

          Voiceprint confirmed.

Will hands Smith the gun.

                      SMITH

          Finally.

Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.

                      SMITH

          A brief lesson in survival on this
          world or any other. Never trust
          anyone. Remember it into your old
          age, should you have one.

          (shoving him forward)

          Now move!

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the
control panel and the descending core material.

                      JOHN

          We can go back across the portals to
          the past, to the functioning Jupiter
          Two, where your mother and sisters
          are still alive. We can use this
          core material to escape together.

                      OLDER WILL

          And then what? All of us lost in
          space. Don't you see? I can do what
          you never could. I can save us all.

Don has edged his way to the descending core material.

                      SMITH (OVER)

          I'm afraid not.

          Through the doorway comes young
          Will, Smith walking behind him, hand
          on his shoulder, gun to his head.

                      SMITH

          Never fear. Smith is here.

                      JOHN

          Will, I. . .

                      SMITH

          Don't move, Professor Robinson or
          this rather peculiar family reunion
          will be tragically brief.

          (off Don)

          I'll ask you to step away from that
          console, Major.

Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.
Smith approaches the Robot.

                      SMITH

          Well, well, some of us just don't
          know when to stay dead.

Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.

                      SMITH

          I borrowed this from the probe ship
          in hopes of taking over the helm
          once we were in flight. But I seem
          to have found a better use instead.

Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,
then fall limp. Docile.

                      SMITH

          Let's try this dance again. You are
          the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do
          get it right this time.

Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.

                      SMITH

          Robot, enable electric disrupters.

The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.

                      SMITH

          Now that's a good gargantuan.

Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.

                      SMITH

          Say goodbye to your past. You're
          future lies with me. I'm going home
          in your place.

Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring
at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.

                      WILL

          You did it. Just like I imagined.
          Re-routed the hypercore. But the
          natural power source, the delivery
          system. I never thought of those.

Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger
self. Touches his hair.

                      OLDER WILL

          You will. The future is never what
          it looks like when you're ten.

                      SMITH

          Heartwarming. Nauseatingly
          sentimental but heartwarming.

Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.

                      SMITH

          We certainly could have aged better,
          I must say Now, show me how your
          little time machine works.

But Will just smiles.

                      SMITH

          An odd moment for mirth, don't you
          think? What are you grinning at?

                      OLDER WILL

          Look around you, Doctor. At this
          hostile world. Do you really think a
          boy could have survived all alone?

SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be
moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.

                      VOICE (OVER)

          Never fear, Smith is here.

The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and
legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
          again after all these years.

Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled
legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          The spider's sting had some
          unexpected side effects.

Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          But my unique gifts gave me an
          advantage in this quarrelsome world.

Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns  to John.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          After the women were savaged, I
          became the father Will never had.

He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,
engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          (bending him)

          But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
          fills me with self-loathing.

          (twisting him)

          You see I have looked within me and
          what I see is you.

With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like
torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I never liked me, anyway.

Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Kill them all.

                      OLDER WILL

          No.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          But my dear boy, once the doorway in
          time stabilizes, this planet is
          going to come apart at the seams.

Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a
twenties starlet.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I am willing to perish here on this
          world for the sake of your most
          noble mission. But your selfish
          father will only try to stop you.

His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Once your mission is complete, none
          of this will have happened anyway.
          So why not just dispose of them?

But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Very well. Robot, take them inside
          the ship and keep them there. If
          they move, then kill them.

ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE

Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground
shakes. Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.

                      MAUREEN

          We've got to get to the ship. Penny?

She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut
before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.

                      MAUREEN

          Where is she, girl?

In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip
waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in
the bubble stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

PAN DOWN

Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the
crew towards the body of the ship.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Well, it would seem the time is upon
          us. Off we go, William.

Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up
towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.

                      JOHN

          (shouting)

          Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
          an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
          on this world and die, why is he
          about to spawn? He's going through
          the portal himself.

The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.

                      ROBOT

          Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.

ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.

OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.

Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging
upside-down. He smiles.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.

EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT

The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins
moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE

Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control
platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.

The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out
over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          It's almost time. I really am a
          word-smith.

                      OLDER WILL

          Once the core cylinder is fully
          injected, the planet will begin to
          come apart and the time doorway will
          stabilize. Then I jump in.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          A leap of faith. How fitting.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not
yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.

                      OLDER WILL

          Tell me again, old monster, how did
          the girls die?

                      SPIDER SMITH

          We've been over this before, son.
          The spiders attacked the ship

                      OLDER WILL

          In all the years since, the spiders
          have never re-surfaced. Why?

Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Let's forget the past.

Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          What are you doing?

                      OLDER WILL

          Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
          energy around the portal will rip a
          man to pieces.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Isn't the doorway too small?

                      OLDER WILL

          Not for me.

          (a beat)

          But then I'm not going, am I? The
          spiders didn't kill the girls. It
          was you. I just never let myself see
          it. You kept me alive because you
          needed me. Because I could build
          this for you. You killed my family.
          Destroyed this world. And I helped.
          You became mad as the spiders.
          ...And I became you.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Poor, poor boy. Did you really think
          I would let you go home? Let all
          that I have become vanish? Look at
          me. I am no mere man. I am a God.

Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Your father was right. Within me
          roil the growing needs of a master
          race. We WILL descend upon helpless
          Earth. An entire planet to rule.

His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,
bearing venomous fangs.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          An entire planet on which to feed.

INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE

John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)
the TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

                      WEST

          I'll run, draw his fire. You may
          have time to get away with Will.

                      ROBOT (OVER)

          Halt or Robot will destroy.

The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.

                      WILL

          Do you remember what I taught you. A
          long time ago. About friendship?

                      ROBOT

          Friendship means acting with your
          heart not your head.

                      WILL

          That's why I rebuilt you. Because I
          wanted us to be friends.

                      ROBOT

          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

                      WILL

          Forget logic. Act with your heart.

                      ROBOT

          Robot has no heart. Robot is powered
          by a fusion pulse generator

                      WILL

          Every living thing has a heart.

The Robot stares at him a beat.

                      ROBOT

          Any attempts to override command
          protocols may result in fused
          processors in my neural net.

The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.

                      WILL

          Please, Robot, if you don't let us
          go, we're all going to die. I'm
          asking you now, will you help us?
          Will you be my friend?

The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control
bolt attached firmly on his CPU.

                      ROBOT

          Robot attempting to deactivate
          control bolt-commands
          overriddenattempting to
          reroute-dangercircuitry
          overloadattempting to escape-kill
          them, kill them...

The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge
building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire.

At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a
piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt.

                      WILL

          You did it.

                      ROBOT

          Robot will save ... I will save Will
          Robinson. I will save my friend.


CHAPTER 21: Time to Die!
------------------------


EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT

Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into
the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES.

                      MAUREEN

          (shouting )

          Penny? Penny?

Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently.

                      MAUREEN

          Where did you go?

                      PENNY

          I came through the forest. I had a
          promise I had to keep.

Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling.

                      JUDY

          Inside. Fast.

INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the
ground RUMBLES.

                      JOHN

          You've got find your way back to the
          ship. The portals may still be
          stable. I'll try to meet you there.

                      WEST

          What do you mean?

                      JOHN

          I'm going to get that core material.
          It's our only chance to escape.

                      WEST

          I'll stay. The family needs their
          father

                      JOHN

          The crew needs their pilot. No
          matter what happens, when the planet
          starts to break up you take off.

                      WEST

          Without the core we'll never have
          enough power to make orbit.

                      JOHN

          You've got to try. Promise me, Don.

A beat. Then Don extends his hand.

                      WEST

          Good luck. Commander.

Just then Will and the Robot arrive.

                      JOHN

          Will. Son. I want you to know-

                      WILL

          (fighting tears)

          You'll tell me when you get back to
          the ship. Now there just isn't time.

John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.

                      JOHN

          I could use a weapon.

The Robot extends his claw. A panel opens on his arm and he tears out
a hand-made component. A conduit made from Will's golden first prize
medals, joined together to make a jagged star.

                      ROBOT

          Professor, I have a plan.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FuTURE

Spider Smith has Will against the rail.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Time to die, son.

                      OLDER WILL

          I'm not your son.

And with that Will SMASHES Spider Smith in the face with two closed
lists. Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Goodbye.

Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming
aperture into the past below him.

PORTAL-CLOSE. Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the
laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable.

WIDER

Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling
from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck.


CHAPTER 22: Time Travel
-----------------------


EXT:-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE

Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain
alongside the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two.

                      WILL

          Look.

On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith. Don checks his pulse.

                      WEST

          (disappointed)

          Damn. He's still breathing.

(OVER) the rushing WIND. RUMBLING. A portal opens before them to a far
younger world. Then another portal, to a world far older. A third
portal RIPS across the sky overhead.

                      WILL

          The time machine must be near full
          power. The portals are collapsing.

                      WEST

          Which one leads us home?

More portals are opening around them, others winking shut.

                      WILL

          There.

Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in
relief of the battered future craft. The ground beneath their feet is
beginning to give way.

                      WILL

          We can't just leave him here.

                      WEST

          Sure we can.

          (off WILL's stare)

          Damn it.

          (slapping the Doctor)

          Smith. Wake up. Smith.

                      SMITH

          (coming to)

          Oh, the pain, the pain.

                      ROBOT

          Danger. Will Robinson. Danger.

The PORTAL is beginning to shimmer. The ground starts to fall away.

                      WEST

          Jump!

Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the
threshold just as the portal winks closed.

EXT. -FOREST- PRESENT

The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith
emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT

The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the
windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble.

                      PENNY

          Mom, the forest.

Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back.

                      MAUREEN

          Where's John?

                      WEST

          The portal closed behind us. It was
          his only way back.

MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air.

                      WEST

          We've got to try and lift off.

                      MAUREEN

          We've already begun the pre-flight
          countdown. You have the Com.

          (off Don's expression)

          I'm going to save as many lives as I
          can, Major. Now strap in.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE

(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls
themselves beginning to crack.

SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank
unfolds above the doorway in time.

                      JOHN (OVER)

          Not so fast.

WIDER

John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand,
slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the
gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists.

                      JOHN

          You sabotaged our mission.

          (hook)

          You killed my family

          (jab)

          You stole my son. It's payback time.

Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect.
It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          Spare me the fury of the righteous.

The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          I think there's time for a snack
          before my trip.

John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last
moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith
across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          (sarcastic)

          Oh, the pain. The pain.

                      JOHN

          You ain't seen nothing yet.

John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the
viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch.

SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised.

                      JOHN

          Remember the probe ship? These
          monsters eat their wounded.


SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of
the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping.

                      SPIDER SMITH

          No. Stop. No!

Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side
of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him,
sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below.

Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red
laser and is swept up by the tides of time.

                      JOHN

          Take all the time you want to die.


Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various
half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether.

John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the
main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The landscape is a sudden inferno.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair.

                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

                      MAUREEN

          Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The.mighty generators WHINE into life.

                      MAUREEN

          (quiet)

          Goodbye, my love.

CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity
---------------------------


The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way.

                      WEST

          Engaging primary thrusters. Now!

EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts
retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-INSERTION ARM-FUTURE

CONTROL CONSOLE-CLOSE. The core material in sinking fast. John moves
towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye.

GANTRY-CLOSE. Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal
reflecting the setting sunlight. John's father's dog tags.

John rushes to the rail. There, still unconscious and hanging by the
dog-tag chain is Older Will.

CHAIN-CLOSE. The metal links are pulling apart. Will is seconds away
from falling into the pool.

JOHN-POV. The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. It's
Will or the core material. No time for both.

John stands a beat, immobile. Then he drops to his knees, reaching
down as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second.

The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up
onto the safety of the gangplank.

                      JOHN

          Come on, son. Wake up.

Will is still. Then, finally, his eyes open.

                      OLDER WILL

          Dad?

                      JOHN

          I thought I lost you.

                      OLDER WILL

          The core.

Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control
panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the
cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.

                      OLDER WILL

          You could have taken the core and
          left before it was too late. You
          saved me instead.

John stares at him.

                      JOHN

          There wasn't any choice. I couldn't
          let you fall.You're my boy.


THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool
stabilizes, becoming clear.

TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch.

Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.

                      OLDER WILL

          Look. They made it.

PAN UP. Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space,
the Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.

INT.JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ship is shaking madly.

                      WEST

          We're not getting any altitude.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The fire GEYSERS are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now
falling away beneath them. A huge spew of flame rages from the
fire-pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers.

                      JUDY

          I'm reading a power build up.
          Markers in the red-

Suddenly the panel EXPLODES, sending Judy flying across the bridge.
Penny races to her sister. Kneels. Judy's eyes are wide, still.

                      PENNY

          She's dead.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below.

                      WEST

          Not enough power to make orbit.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRES ENT

Another firestorm. A flame geyser hits the ship. Then another.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Control panels all around the ship begin to SLOW. The main screen is
hit by a flying chunk of rock. The giant glass begins to crack.

                      WEST

          (to Maureen)

          I'm sorry.

The windshield EXPLODES, sucking them both out into space.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT

The ship is hit by another fire geyser. The Jupiter Two EXPLODES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE

John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the
fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. The ship is struck
once, again, finally EXPLODING in a ROARING ball of fire.

JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.

                      JOHN

          I couldn't save them.

Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway,
a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the
morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.

                      OLDER WILL (OVER)

          So many years ago and I can still
          feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's
          all I've thought about. Going home.

Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in
the laser generated doorway begin to change.

                      OLDER WILL

          A long time ago, you told a small
          boy that one day he'd understand how
          precious he was, how much his father
          loved him. Today is that day.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,
the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.

                      OLDER WILL

          All I could see was your need to go
          forward at any cost. What you never
          showed me was your love. I lost
          that. Robbed by time. I could never
          see how much you cared. Until now.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire
geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards,
the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past
diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.

                      OLDER WILL

          Father, take my hand.

INT.-CUPITER TWO

We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam.
Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair.

                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

                      MAUREEN

          Let's go, Major.

Don hits the engine switch. The mighty generators WHINE into life.

                      MAUREEN

          (quiet)

          Goodbye my love.

                      PENNY

          Look.

The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like
water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL.

2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE

The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated
doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.

                      OLDER WILL

          DON'T make me wait another lifetime
          to know how you feel.

And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down
through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles
her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the
watery hull.

                      JOHN

          Come with us.

But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the
world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.

                      OLDER WILL

          I can't. There was only enough power
          for one person, one trip, remember?

                      MAUREEN

          Will?

                      OLDER WILL

          It's good to see you again, Mom.
          It's good to see you alive.

          (fading)

          Sorry about all the monkey business.

Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands
almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.

                      JOHN

          He sacrificed everything for his
          family.

                      MAUREEN

          (fighting tears)

          He had a good example.

Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.

                      WILL

          Dad?

A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.

                      WILL

          I'm glad you came back.

                      JOHN

          I just want you to know I love you
          son. I love you very much.

John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.
(OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way.

                      WEST (OVER)

          The planet is breaking up around us.

John moves fast to the Com.

                      WEST

          Nice of you to drop in.

John smiles a beat, then he's all business.

                      JOHN

          Status?

(OVER) A tremendous CRASH.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into

giant caverns of fire.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      SMITH

          We're doomed. We're doomed.

West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold.

                      WEST

          Boy, that felt good.

                      JOHN

          Get us airborne.

Don throws the power switches to full.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The
Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses
upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      WEST

          I'm going to try to reach escape
          velocity. Maybe we can break the
          gravitational pull.

                      JOHN

          No. We don't have the core material.
          The gravity wells will drag us down.

                      WEST

          We might-

                      JOHN

          We won't make it. Trust me. I know.
          We've got to go down.

                      WEST

          What?

                      JOHN

          Through the planet as she breaks up.

                      WEST

          That's insane.

                      JOHN

          I don't have time to argue. I'm
          giving you a direct order, Major.

Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.

                      WEST

          Yes Sir.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a
fiery maw. DON GUNS the engines, heading straight for the chasm.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

DON is flying into the shattering center of the planet. Masses of
continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.

INT.-JUPITER TWO

                      JOHN

          There.

A window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away
revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.

                      WEST

          I see it.

Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments
of this shattering world.

EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The ship clears the planet as the world EXPLODES in the b.g.

DON guides the ship out into space. Judy comes up behind him.

                      JUDY

          Nice work, flyboy.

                      WEST

          So, I earn that kiss yet?

                      JUDY

          (a peck on the cheek)

          You earned that.

DON shrugs, begins to turn away. Judy grabs him.

                      JUDY

          This one is on credit.

She gives him a long, passionate kiss. She lets him go, stunned.

                      JUDY

          Cold fish, huh?

Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to BLIP madly.

                      MAUREEN

          Poor thing. She's lost her whole
          family.

          (off Penny)

          Penny, why are you looking at me
          like that. Penny?

Penny presses a button. Blast doors open on a storage hold.

                      PENNY

          I promised Judy I'd take care of
          her. I couldn't leave her all alone.

(all stare at her)

          Well I am their princess, after all.

          (turning)

          You can come out mow.

Forms in the cargo hold de-camouflage. The other lizard monkeys,
standing amidst glittering canisters of Dimondium.

                      JOHN

          Dimondium. Now if we could only find
          our way back to Earth.

                      ROBOT

The Robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy. The Jupiter
Two is highlighted. Earth blinks at the other and.

          THE WASTELAND. DAY.

          Flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move
          through an eerie, barren land. The only sound is the
          howl of a rising wind.

          Ahead something looms out of the storm. As we approach
          we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil
          pump.

          The wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very
          old man. This is the Narrator:

          Out of the dust storm emerges the ancient wreck of

          charred, its wheels and sides studded with metal
          crossbow bolts.

          NARRATOR v/a

          road vehicle: two engines and a seat mounted on a
          chassis.

          But, most of all, I remember
          the courage of a stranger, a

          The black-on-black pursuit car, bearing the scars of

          On the bor:.zon we see a burning wooden s:iack and
          three bodies strung from a gnarled, dead tree.
          MAX looks back to the MEN. Several of then, having seen
          him, are running to their vehicles.
          The first of them is a muscular man with a red mohawk

          The black-oD-black surges around a wide curve,
          revealing only three vehicles still in pursuit.
          The first machine is Wez's big road bike, the
          GOLDEN YOUTH riding pillion. It is followed by a
          bizarre road racer and a strange dune buggy.
          As the black-on-black crests a rise MAX is confronted
          by a tangle of wrecked vehicles on the road ahead.
          He swerves, slaloms through the wrecks and accelerates
          into a sweeping right hand curve.
          WEZ ramps his bike over the first wreck and corrects,
          avoiding the other wrecks.
          The road racer ramps two wheels over the first wreck
          but cannot correct. It clips the second wreck, sends
          it spinning, then continues after the black-on-black.
          The dune buggy decides to avoid the wrecks altogether
          and veers off the road to the right. It,.heads across
          open terrain aiming to intercept the black-on-black 1

          A light flashes on Max's dashboard, an alarm whoops,
          MAX looks down at the fuel gauge: close to empty,
          He curses and flicks a switch, cutting off the
          supercharger.
          The black-on-black slows...
          The DOG whimpers, crawls off its chair and under Max's
          seat.
          WEZ overhauls MAX on the passenger side: He raises his
          forearm, aiming his gauntlet-style crossbow at MAX'S
          head.
          MAX barely has time to glimpse the road racer drawing
          alongside the driver's door.
          The passenger - a GAYBOY BERSERKER - wields a brutal,
          gas-powered 'gun': the heads of six metal arrows
          protrude from a big barrel. This weapon is the
          "porta-pak".
          MAX hits the brakes,
          The road racer and the bike surge past the black car...
          just as the porta-pak fires.
          Two arrows thud into the black car, three go astray
          and one hits WEZ in the arm.
          MAX throws the black car in behind the road racer...
          WEZ, fighting to control the bike, leaves the road...
          MAX changes down and hits the supercharger...
          The black car leaps forward, ramming into the back of
          the road racer, bullying it along.
          Wheels and metal screaming, the two cars approach an
          intersection littered with furniture and other debris.
          A road rig lies abandoned on the roadside.
          MAX eases back for a moment then flattens the
          accelerator...
          The black car slams into the back of the road racer...
          hurling it forward, just as the dune buggy regains the

           The driver of the road racer screams as his vehicle
           hits the dune buggy, spinning it like a top, sending
           it crashing into the side of the road rig.
           The road racer slides through a 180 degrees, rolls,
           smashes through a road sign and hits a power pole.
          The pole thuds to the road as MAX throws a handbrake
          "U" turn and skids to a halt in the middle of the
          intersection.
          MAX, carrying a jerry can, gets out of the black car.
          He looks down the highway.

          WEZ is stopped on the crest of the road, looking down
          on the intersection. The arrow is still in his arm.
          We see the GOLDEN YOUTH clearly for the first time:
          he is strikingly beautiful,.

          MAX, unfazed , hurries to the wreck of the dune buggy,
          crushed beneath the road rig. Fuel streams from its
          ruptured tank.
          From inside the wreck we hear the moans of the injured
          driver.
          MAX puts the jerry can under the escaping fuel and
          tearing a bandana from his neck - mops up the gasolene
          lying on the bitumen.
          Suddenly, there is a shrill whistle.
          MAX looks up at the crest of the road.

          11. THE RISE OVERLOOKING THE INTERSECTION. DAY. 11.
           WEZ grins as he pulls the arrow slowly out of his
           arm. His eyes never leave MAX.
           He holds up the arrow and mouths the words:

                          I

                         WEZ
          For you.
          With that he puts the arrow back into his quiver and
          guns the motor. He rea.; the front wheel, hangs there
          a moment, then spins th,: bike around and roars back

          MAX, examines the road rig:
          most of the tyres have been punctured with arrows, the
          rear doors torn off and its contents pillaged.
          MAX taps the fuel tank - empty.
          He reaches up to open the door of the cabin...
          There is an anguished scream, MAX turns.
          The hand of the dying driver emerges from the twisted
          metal of the dune buggy.
          The fingernails score deeply into the paint-work, a
          rush of dark blood pours out of the wreck. Then, silence.
          MAX opens the cabin door...
          A figure drops down, crashing onto his shoulders. As
          MAX struggles from its grasp we see that it is the
          bloated putrifying corpse of the rig's driver. Two
          crossbow bolts are buried in its neck...-
          MAX stoops and picks up a toy hurdy-gurdy which has
          fallen from the dead man's hand.
          As he walks back towards the black-on-black he turns
          the handle, playing the first few notes of "Happy
          Birthday".
          He stops next to the vehicle, in the middle of the
          intersection. He looks from one direction to another.
          undecided... and then sees the smashed road sign.
          He picks up a fragment which reads:

          ONE TREE HILL
          And throws it into the air.
          It lands at h:_s feet, pointing north.
          He gets into the car and drives off in that direction.

           the engine and the whistle of the wind.

          13. Cont. 13,
           As the car crests a rise MAX looks ahead and sees a
           large kite - in the shape of a man's grinning face -
           hovering above a dune.
          MAX leaves the DOG to guard the car .nd, carrying a
          jerry can and a tyre iron, cautiously makes his way
          across the sand.

          14. ON THE DUNES. DAY. 14.
          From the,top of the dune MAX sees that the kite is
          tethered to an abandoned vehicle: a primitive
          version of a gyrocopter - little more than a motor,
          a seat and a rotor mounted on a chassis.
          A set of footprints leads from the gyrocopter,
          dune and disappears into the distance.
          Slowly MAX approaches the vehicle, skirting around it,
          looking for a trap. Nothing moves except for the
          flurries of sand whirling across the dunes.

          15. THE GYROCOPTER. DAY. 15.
          Carefully, MAX reaches up and taps the gas tank: empty.
          As he straightens up, he hears a low hiss.
          MAX freezes. Only inches away a snake, coiled around
          the vertical shaft of the gyro, is poised to strike..
          They stare at each other.
          The snake strikes... MAX springs... hand flashing...
          catching it by the neck.
          He holds up the snake, grinning, about to kill, it.
          The head and shaft of an arrow emerge from the sand
          behind him. It is followed by the frame of a crossbow
          and a man's face, spitting sand, a length of rubber
          hose clenched in his teeth. This is the GYRO CAPTAIN.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Don't hurt that snake!

          15, Cont. 15,
          MAX turns. The CAPTAIN emerges from his shallow grave,
          motioning with the crossbow.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Put him back... gently!
          MAX lays the snake on the rotor.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Sounded like a big V-8 to me.
          I guess I got myself some
          guzzolene.
          He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing
          to fire.

                         MAX
          The car's booby-trapped.
          Touch those tanks and
          BOOM! You'll blow yourself
          apart.
          The CAPTAIN looks quickly in the direction of the
          black-on-black, and back to MAX. He gestures with
          the crossbow.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Drop the weapons...
          Now back up.
          MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster
          which contains a sawn-off shotgun.
          The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder.

          1.6. THE DESERT ROAD - MAX'S CAR.DAY. 16.
          MAX walks backwards towards his car. The CAPTAIN
          tense, crossbow trained on MAX, follows him across
          the dune.

          a snake. Never. Reflexes,
          that's what you've got.
          Me? I've got brains.
          He taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Now, where's this booby-trap?
          MAX reaches under the car. His hand groping for a
          machete clipped to the chassis. His fingers wrap
          around the handle.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          A fella - a quick fella - might
           keep a weapon under there.
          He nuzzles,the bow against the back of MAX'S head.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Then I'd have to pin his
          head to the panel.
          MAX slides his hand away, disconnects a series of
          mechanical fuses and shows them to the CAPTAIN. He
          moves to open the driver's door. The CAPTAIN
          reacts quickly, raising his bow, motioning MAX back.

                         MAX
          There's one more.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Oh no! You don't play me the
          fool.
          The CAPTAIN, keeping the crossbow trained on MAX'S
          head, opens the door.
          The DOG flies out, leaping for the CAPTAIN'S throat.
          The crossbow discharges, narrowly missing MAX as he
          hurls himself at the CAPTAIN. The steel arrow buries r
          itself in the car door.
          MAX pins the CAPTAIN to the ground and recovers his
          shotgun.

          the shotgun is strapped to the back of his bead and
          the stock fastened to the top of the seat.
          A length of wire runs from the triggers across to the
          DOG sitting in the rear of the car. The end of the
          wire is clasped firmly in its mouth.
          The CAPTAIN, not daring to take his eyes off the DOG
          directs MAX along back roads to an area of high
          country.
          The DOG'S eyes dart out the window. He whimpers, body
          twitching.
          The CAPTAIN stares in horror at a rabbit bounding through
          the scrub.

          The DOG settles back.
          i8. A CLIFFTOP OVERLOOKING THE COMPOUND. DAY.
          MAX moves towards the cliff edge. A column of smoke
          rises into the sky, accompanied by a garble of distant
          sounds: police sirens; car horns; men screaming;
          war-whoops; and revving motors.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN - manacled and guarded by the DOG -
          hobbles along behind MAX.
          From the top of the cliff MAX looks down On a battle
          raging on the plain below.
          A fortified encampment, surrounded by a wide ditch
          and coils of barbed wire, is under attack by a large
          gang of MARAUDERS: MOHAWK BIKERS, SMEGMA CRAZIES in
          dune buggies, and GAYBOY BERSERKERS in road racers.
          They attack along a road which passes through an area -
          outside the fortifications - which is under cultivation.
          Three wooden work huts, a small barn and a corral
          containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a
          newly-ploughed field.
          As the Marauders' vehicles come within range of the
          compound, they stream around the perimeter, firing
          crossbows at the DEFENDERS ranged along the battlements.

          GYRO CAPTAIN I
          Well.,. I never said it'd
          be easy.
          MAX unhooks an old pair of binoculars from the
          equipment belt around his,waist.

          19, THE COMPOUND. POV BINOCULARS. DAY.
          Through the binoculars MAX sees a weird dune buggy
          charging towards the camp. He recognises the two
          bizarre occupants as members of the gang be
          encountered sacking the farmiet the day before.
          The dune buggy races along a causeway which spans the which blocks
          ditch, heading for a yellowPAschool SSENGERuin buggy
          the gate of the camp.
          fires a string of arrows from a multi-barrel gas-gun.
          A WARRIOR WOMAN on the battlement, armed with a flame-
          thrower, hits the buggy with a stream of liquid fire.
          The blazing vehicle plunges into the ditch. It tumbles - its
          into another wreck which met a similar fate
          tyres still smouldering.
          MAX pans his binoculars to the interior of the compound.
          He sees a large mechanical pump drawing the oil. from
          the ground and a primitive fractionating column used to
          refine it.
          A DEFENDER firing from the refinery tower is struck by
          an arrow. He falls over the guard rail, where a
          dead companion hangs over the edge, suspended by his
          foot.
          The sound of an amplified voice draws MAX'S attention,
          He swings the binoculars around:

          20. THE HILLSIDE ACROSS FROM TH.E COMPOUND. DAB .
          A huge, muscular man - his face covered by a metal
          mask - sits in a bizarre six-wheeled vehicle. He
          uses a microphone to shout orders to the MARAUDERS,
          directing the course of the battle. This man is
          the HUMUNGUS.
          Beside him, is the Mohawk Biker called WEZ. He sits
          astride his bike, the GOLDEN YOUTH clinging to his
          waist. He speaks with HUMUNGUS, pointing, sweeping
          his hand.

          The DOG lies nearby. Further away the GYRO CAPTAIN

          The MARAUDERS have formed a bridge of car wrecks across
          the ditch near aless defended section of the compound.
          At WETS signal three bikes ride at the bridge of
          wrecks. Two of them are hit almost immediately but the
          third rides over the wrecks and attempts to ramp into
          the compound.
          The bike flies through the air... and bounces into the
          wire. The RIDER sails over the fence into the compound
          where he is set upon by THREE DEFENDERS.

          ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups
          each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland.
          The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS,
          camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp,
          Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and

          the hilltop.

          MAX looks past the black-on-black, to where the lone
          compound vehicle has achieved the bitumen.
          Suddenly, three Mohawk bikes and a tow truck emerge
          from behind a rocky outcrop. Led by WEZ, they fire
          arrows into the tyres and smash the windscreen.
          The compound vehicle leaves the road, rolling...
          As the GYRO CAPTAIN crawls to his side, MAX raises his
          binoculars...

          30. MAX'S POV BINOCULARS. MORNING. 30.
          The bloodied driver is being dragged from the wreck
          by TWO MOHAWKERS. The others cannibalise the vehicle
          and siphon off its fuel. Another occupant emerges
          from the twisted metal and tries to crawl away...
          I t is a YOUNG WOMAN.

          31, REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 31.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN sees her and fumbles urgently for
          something deep in the pockets of his great-coat.
          He produces a large telescope which is attached to
          his waist by a leather cord.

          Through the cracked lens of the telescope we see
          two of the MOHAWIMRS dragging the woman to the
          roadside.

          33. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 33.
          MAX looks around to see the GYRO CAPTAIN'S telescope
          and grabs it. The GYRO CAPTAIN, protesting, picks up
          the less-powerful binoculars.
          MAX lifts tae telescope.

          34. MAX'S POV. TELESCOPE. MORNING. 34,
          The GOLDEN YOUTH is sitting on one of the bikes. The
          POV whip pans across the wreck where two MOHAWKERS
          have pushed the badly injured driver up to the car
          panel, WEZ fires an arrow into the man's shoulder,
          pinning it to the panel..
          Methodically, he reloads and fires another pin into the
          man's other shoulder.
          MAX pans the telescope to where the three MOHAWKERS
          hold the STRUGGLING WOMAN. At WEZ'S signal they start
          to tear the woman's clothes away...

          35. REAR OF CLIFFTOP LOOKOUT. MORNING. 35,
          Track in as the GYRO CAPTAIN and MAX watch through
          the binoculars and telescope.
          Camera tightens further to the GYRO CAPTAIN. His
          face reacts to the horror below.
          MAX drops his head... his eyes closing momentarily.
          The noise of vehicles starting below breaks the
          moment.
          He lifts the telescope and pans to one side.

          While MAX has the telescope trained on the departing

          WOMAN.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN

          The lens finds the remaining MOHAWKER now standing

          crossbow...

          MAX has dropped the telescope and is on his feet
          running down to the black-on-black. The DOG is at his
          heels.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Hey! What about me?!!
           The black-on-black roars off...

          40. THE WRECK OF THE COMPOUND VEHICLE. DAY.
          We track low past the dead girl's face towards the back
          of the MOHAWKER. He is sitting on a wheel pulling on
          his trousers,
          Close to his back, the camera stops.
          He turns, looking up.
          MAX, carrying a pair of bolt cutters is hurrying towards
          him.

          The MOHAWKER grabs for his crossbow.
          MAX'S foot stamps down, pinning his wrist...
          Ssswish? the bolt cutters swing down... onto the
          Mohawker's head.
          Tears stream down the COMPOUND MAN'S face.
          As MAX walks up to him we see that he is bleeding
          badly. His name is NATHAN.

                         NATHAN
          Thank you. Thank you...

          I.

                         MAX
          Let's get this straight.
          I'm doing it 'cos I need
          fuel.

                         NATHAN
          As much as you want. Take
          me back... Don't let me die.
          MAX takes the bolt cutters and inserts them between the
          man and the panel. He cuts away the first arrow, then
          the second.

          WIPE,

          The supercharger screams as MAX races towards the
          compound.
          NATHAN is slipping into unconsciousness.
          MAX grabs him by the shoulder, shaking him.

                         MAX

          Angle down on the plain.
          The black-on-black approaches the burnt out huts.
          A GAYBOY BERSERKER stands up into frame in the extreme
          foreground.
          He is joined by TWO OTHER MARAUDERS.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER grabs a hand-mirror and flashes a
          signal across the wasteland.
          From a far hill, we see the answering flash.

          43. THE PLOUGHED FIELD. DAY. 43.
          Crane down from a high angle on the black-on-black
          as it approaches the camp. As the camera achieves a
          smouldering but we see a small animal-like
          figure stalking the vehicle.
          Tracking closer we see that it is a wild-looking
          child, about 8 years old. He is dressed in dog skins
          and carries a chrome boomerang. On one hand he wears
          what looks like a catcher's mitt: a leather glove
          reinforced with steel plates. This is the FERAL KID.
          Before we get too close the boy scurries into a large
          rabbit warren.

          44. THE CAUSEWAY LEADING TO THE COMPOUND. DAY. 44.
          Long low angle on the compound. Its defenders wait
          on the barricades, the cracking tower and the
          catwalk.
          The black car stops just outside crossbow range - about
          twenty yards short of the compound.
          In extreme foreground, the FERAL BOY'S head pops up
          from another rabbit hole closer to the compound.
          He ducks down out of sight when the car door opens.
          High angle on MAX as he steps out of the car with
          NATHAN across his shoulders.
          MAX carries no weapons and as he steps up to camera,
          he raises his arms high...
          A woman on the barricade begins screaming. Her name
          is BIG REBECCA,

          A man on the catwalk orders the gate to be openeâ¢3..
          MAX hurries along the causeway...
          The FERAL KID comes out of the rabbit warren and
          begins to follow MAX.
          A trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the
          causeway...
          As MAX approaches the camp the old ï¿½ello'.v school bus
          is pulled aside.
          The I A3IRI011 WOMAN emerges, crossbow read., , keeping it
          trained on MAX.
          She is followed by another defender the MECHANIC'S
          ASSISTANT - pulling a strange mechanised crane.

          PAPPAGALLO. He"is standing at the gate, surrounded
          by anxious defenders.

                         BIG REBECCA
          Look at your handiwork!
          They didn't have a chance...
          One of the group at the gate -- a nuggety old man
          called the CURMUDGEON - plays to the crowd, pointing

                         AT PAPPAGALLO:

                         THE CURMUDGEON
          You all heard me, I warned
          him didn't I? Madness, I said.

          As the DEFENDERS part to let MAX through we see the
          group includes: a teenage couple - PISMO and ANGIE
          - holding each other tight; a woman BUTCHER, holding
          a knife and a rabbit; a middle aged man who looks
          like a FARMER; and a LUSTY young girl chewing her
          finger nails.

                         WARRIOR WOMAN

          he said.
          How? I said.
          Get a prime mover, he said...
          He points to NATHAN who is being carried to an old
          bread van. The rear door is open, revealing two
          hospital-style beds, drip stands and shelves of medical
          supplies. An injured camp member occupies one of the
          beds.

                         CURMUDGECN
          .And there's the result!
          Madness I said!
          PAPPAGALLO ignores him, addressing MAX:

                         PAPPAGALLO
          Where did you find him?

                         MAX
          Two, three miles away.,, left
          for dead.,, next to his car.
          We made a deal.
          In the background the FARMER starts to work the first
          arrow out of NATHAN'S chest.
          BIG REBECCA comforts him.

          him in, you'd give me gas.
          There's no time...
          An anxious young man pushes through the crowd, talking
          over MAX. This is the QUIET MAN.

                         QUIET MAN
          There was a woman...
          in the car...
          MAX looks straight at him.

                         MAX
          She's dead.
          The man struggles to keep hold of his emotions.

          How? What did they do?

                         MAX
          It was quick.
          The QUIET MAN bows his head and turns away.
          NATHAN groans, ANGIE has the clear plastic mask of
          an air viva device over NATHAN'S face, PISMO pumps
          air into his lungs.
          MAX turns to PAPPAGALLO:

          I saw a man in trouble. I
          brought him in. And now I

          Give him nothing.
          There's an ugly murmur of agreement.
          MAX, keeping his temper, talks to PAPPAGALLO:

                         MAX
          We had a contract...
          The FARMER succeeds in removing the first arrow.
          BIG REBECCA relaxes
          NATHAN sputters. Blood sprays into the plastic mask.
          BIG REBECCA screams. The FERAL KID looks on as the
          FARMER feels for a pulse: nothing.
          PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX:

          I don't know who you are,
          or what happened.
          But if you had a contract,
          it was with him. And it
          died with him.
          PAPPAGALLO t'.trns on his heel and walks through the
          crowd, back towards his tent.
          The WARRIOR WOMAN puts a bow to MAX'S temple and
          shoves him towards the gate.

          The yellow school bus roars across, closing the
          entrance.

          47. THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY, 47.
          The compound people run to their positions on the
          battlements.
          A pair of manacles are locked around MAX'S wrists.
          WARRIOR WOMAN climbs to a big crossbow mounted above
          the causeway.
          The BUTCHER drops her knife and grabs her long bow.
          The rabbit on the chopping block leaps for safety.
          PAPPAGALLO mans the flame thrower. Others draw their
          bows.
          The FERAL KID follows the rabbit down a hole at the
          foot of the battlement.
          As MAX climbs to a position on the battlements near
          WARRIOR WOMAN and PAPPAGALLO he sees that the MARAUDER
          HORDE has gathered in all its glory.

          46. NO MAN'S LAND. DAY. 48,
          The MARAUDERS rumble in formation over the rise:
          At their head' is the Humungus machine surrounded by a
          guard consisting of WEZ and his GOLDEN YOUTH on a
          bike, a tow truck with TWO SKIN HEADS, a road racer
          with THREE GAY BOY BERSERKERS and a dune buggy with

          TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES.
          As the advance guard approaches through the dust and
          heat haze we see that SIX NEAR NAKED AND BLOODIED
          PEOPLE are lashed to the front of the vehicles.
          At the big crossbow, the WARRIOR WOMAN aims at the
          Humungus machine. One of the TWO VICTIMS, tied to the
          front of the Humungus machine, is screaming above the
          awesome rumble of machines and sirens...

          49. THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY. 49,
          The camp people moan as they recognise the victims.
          PAPPAGALLO holds up his hand, stopping the WARRIOR
          WOMAN from firing.
          â¢ The MECHANIC cranes himself up into view next to MAX:

                         MECHANIC
          Poor mongrels... not one
          got through.
          BIG REBECCA sobs. The QUIET MAN puts a comforting
          hand on her shoulder.
          PISMO and ANGIE huddle closer together.

          50. NO MAN'S LAND, DAY. 50.
           The vanguard of 5 vehicles stops on the causeway,
          just out of range.
          MAX and WEZ look across no man's land, recognising
          each other. WEZ grins, a gold tooth flashing.
          The TOADIE, a comically dressed Marauder perched on
          the top of the Humungus vehicle, waves his arms. The
          Marauders cut their motors... Silence.
          The TOADIE announces:

                         TOADIE
          Greetings from the Lord Humungus
          The Warrior of the Wasteland!
          The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller.
          Camera cranes up to the HUMUNGUS as he rises in his
          seat. His voice is amplified by two loudspeakers
          mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle:

          The SECOND VICTIM lashed onto the Humungus vehicle
          shouts in defiance:

          Shoot! Shoot him! While you've
          got the chance...
          The TOADIE takes the wind out of him with an elbow
          to the stomach...
          The FERAL KID watches from a rabbit warren near a burnt
          out hut.
          The HUMUNGUS continues...

                         HUMUNGUS
          You set out this morning to
          find a vehicle. A vehicle
          strong enough to haul that
          fat tank of gas...
          Suddently, the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the
          barricade and out into the wasteland. WEZ whirls his
          arm around... thud!... the rabbit falls dead from a
          crossbow bolt.
          The FERAL KID eases back down into his hole.
          The TOADIE bellows:

                         TOADIE
          You see! There is no escape.
          The Humungus rules the
          wasteland...

                         DEFIANT VICTIM
          Don't give them the gas!

          WEZ leaps from his bike and head-butts the man into

          The FERAL BOY runs from his hole, screaming. He
          lets fly with the chrome boomerang...
          The projectile whistles past WEZ'S head and returns
          to the KID.
          He reaches up and - clunk! catches it in his steel,
          plated mitten.
          The MARAUDERS roar with laughter.
          The FERAL KID throws the boomerang again...
          WEZ ducks and it buries itself into the head of the

          GOLDEN YOUTH.
          The MARAUDERS are dumbstruck.

          WEZ bends over the GOLDEN'YOUTH and pulls the weapon
          from his skull.
          He hurls it at the FERAL KID.
          The boomerang whistles across the ground... the KID
          throws himself down into the hole... the boomerang
          arcs and returns to WEZ... out of his reach.
          The TOADIE runs forward...

          The HUMUNGUS and MARAUDERS roar with laughter.
          WEZ, bellowing with rage, leaps up dnto the
          HUMUNGUS vehicle. He hits the ignition, yelling:

                         WEZ
          There's been enough talk.
          I'm going in!
          Powerful arms encircle him from behind. WEZ is lifted

          wrist.
          He produces the hurdy-gurdy he found on the bloated
          man and plays the first few notes of "Happy Birthday".
          From the hole under MAX, the FERAL KID appears wiping
          his boomerang. He is attracted by the noise.
          MAX plays the next few notes faster.
          The FERAL KID grins.
          More notes - very fast.
          The FERAL KID laughs.
          Several people at the back of the CROWD, including
          WARRIOR WOMAN, turn around to look. MAX holds the
          manacles up so that she can see that he's free.

          see of him.

          59. THE COMPOUND DITCH - THE BRIDGE OF WRECKS. NIGHT. 59,
          From the battlement, PAPPAGALLO watches as MAX,
          accompanied by the DOG, emerges from a hole in the
          wall. MAX has a pole across his shoulders,
          supporting four jerry cans of fuel..
          MAX'S knee brace"squeaks in the stillness.
          The MECHANIC throws him a small can. MAX squirts
          a stream of oil onto the metal and then moves off
          across the bridge of wrecks, built by the Mohawk
          Bikers the day before.
          The FERAL KID watches with other camp people as MAX
          and the DOG move out into the night.

          60, NO MAN'S LAND. NIGHT. 60.
          MAX emerges from the ditch, the heavy load weighing
          him down. Behind him, the searchlight from the
          compound plays over the wilderness. Ahead, he sees
          the glow of the Marauders' campfires.
          He moves forward silently.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          61. NEAR THE MAHAUDL S ' CAM1'k i hLJ . NIGHT. 61,
          Picking his way carefully across rugged ground,
          MAX skirts close to a large campfire.
          Around it, a GROUP OF MARAUDERS are carousing: some
          are laughing loudly at a VICTIM strung up to a beam
          by his wrists. A bottle passes among the MARAUDERS.
          In the shadows, lit by the flickering flame, a MOHAWK
          BIKER fondles TWO CAMP FOLLOWERS.
          Closest to MAX a GAYBOY BERSERKER hones his machete
          on a whetstone.
          MAX skirts round him, not taking his eyes off him.
          Suddenly MAX'S leg gives way, caught in a rabbit hole.
          He pitches forward, the ferry cans thumping together.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER pivots.., listening.., knife ready.
          MAX is spread-eagled on the ground. The DOG curls its
          lip. The GAYBOY BERSERKER walks towards MAX, his eyes
          searching the darkness...
          There is a loud barking! MAX looks up...
          On a rabbit warren close by, the FERAL KID sits on his
          haunches, howling like a wild dog.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER takes a rock and throws it, curs-
          ing all howling dogs, and returns to the camp.
          The FERAL KID motions for MAX to follow. Keeping low,
          MAX limps forward.

          62. AN EROSION DITCH. NIGHT. 62.
          The FERAL KID stops at the edge of the gully and
          indicates the direction for MAX to take. He grins at
          MAX and runs off into the night, back the way he came.
          MAX drops down into the gully heading away from the
          Marauders' camp.

          DISSOLVE,

          63. THE CLIFFTOP. FIRST LIGHT. 63.
          MAX climbs up to the spot where he left the GYRO CAPTAIN.
          Gone!... Just the canopy, a dog food can and a freshly-
          dug hole where the tree stump used to be. A clear trail,
          gouged in the dirt, leads back towards the sand dune
          country. The DOG sniffs and lopes off,..

          MAX and the DOG crest a rise at the edge of the
          pan.
          About a hundred yards ahead, out on the
          clay, is the CAPTAIN, still dragging the tree
          stump behind him.
          T h e DOG growls.
          The CAPTAIN turns to see MAX, He picks up the log
          and tries to run.

          65. THE WASTELAND. DAY.

          65.
          The sun is much higher in the sky, The CAPTAIN has
          been freed from the tree stump and now carries the
          ferry cans, coolie-like, across his shoulders.

          66. THE DUNES. DAY.

          66.
          The three travellers stagger over the dune. Tha
          gyro copter is intact though the kite now rests
          face dawn on the sand, At the crest of the dune
          they sue the body of a lone Marauder. Foot and
          tyre prints tell the story. Crossing the dunes in
          his buggy, he happened across the gyrocopter. He
          left his buggy, walked down to the abandoned
          gyrocopter and fell victim to the snake, He
          staggered around in circles before slumping face
          down in the sand.
          The CAPTAIN lets out a whoop as he and MAX half
          stumble, half run towards the body.

                         CAPTAIN
          I knew it. I knew it'd work.
          Lethal, those snakes. Lethal.
          Born killers. The snake's
          fangs, my brains. Lethal I

                         TELL YA
          The CAPTAIN stops, staring down at the body of the
          snake, its head crushed,
          Quickly he picks it up and begins to skin it,
          muttering,
          Sc. 66. Cont.

          Don't think you're gonna get
          any of this. Cos you're not.
          It was my snake. I found it.
          I trained it. And I'm gonna
          eat it.
          Keeping the gun trained on the CAPTAIN, MAX
          rummages through the MARAUDER'S clothes. He finds
          a necklace of spark plugs, bolts, teeth and two old
          shotgun cartridges.
          MAX removes the two cartridges. One crumbles apart.
          The second, although dog-eared, remains intact,
          The GYRO CAPTAIN looks up as MAX cracks open the
          shotgun - both barrels are empty.
          MAX shoves the dog-eared cartridge into the barrel
          and snaps the shotgun shut.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN gasps:

                         CAPTAIN
          You mean? All this time?
          Jesus, that's dishonest!
          MAX nudges the CAPTAIN towards the gyrocopter.
          The CAPTAIN stands fast, eyeing the shotgun...

                         CAPTAIN
          How do we know that one's
          not a dud.

                         MAX
          There's only one way to
          find out.
          He lifts the barrel to the CAPTAIN'S head.
          The CAPTAIN moves off towards the gyrocopter.

          67. SAND DUNES- GYROCOPTER. DAY. 67.
          One jerry can lies discarded by the gyro. MAX,
          with the DOG on his lap, is settled on the chassis,
          the three remaining cans strapped on beside him.
          A flurry of sand whips back from the propellor.
          The gyro, unaccustomed to the extra weight, lumbers
          across the sand and slowly rises into the sky.

          The bloated fly-blown corpse of the driver lies
          next to the abandoned road rig.
          The bonnet of the prime mover is up and MAX is
          working on the engine.
          A chain passes from the bull bar up into the cabin where
          the CAPTAIN sits behind the wheel, muttering into a
          handkerchief.
          The DOG watches him carefully.
          MAX yanks on the chain.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN tests the motor: nothing.
          After two more attempts it splutters to life.

          DISSOLVE.

                         :R

          69 THE PRIME MOVER. LATER THAT DAY. 69.
          The prime mover, disconnected from the rest of the
          rig, stands in the middle of the road.
          MAX is in the cabin with the DOG, the engine running,
          The GYRO CAPTAIN looks up at him, rattling his chains.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          You can't just dump me!
          Think of us as partners.
          MAX tosses him a set of keys, shouting over the
          engire.

                         MAX
          It's up to you. Fly a kite,
          or follow me back. Maybe
          they'll throw some gas your

          The GYRO CAPTAIN, struggling to unlock his manacles,
          yells after him:

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          What sort of deal's that?!
          I'm running on empty!

          WIPE.

          70, THE LONELY HIGHWAY. DAY. 70.
          MAX hurls the prime mover down the long empty
          highway, eating up the miles.

          WIPE.

          71. HILL CREST NEAR PINNACLES. DAY. 71.
          The'prime mover crests a bill. In the distance MAX
          can see the pinnacles surrounding the camp. He
          checks his shotgun on the seat beside him. MAX
          tramps the accelerator.
          The DOG climbs under the seat. The back wheels burn
          rubber as the prime mover thunders down the road...
          Suddenly the gyrocopter zooms over the rise behind him
          spluttering and coughing like he's running out of
          gas.

          72. SIDE OF ROAD NEAR THE PINNACLES. DAY. 72.
          In the Marauders' camp a MOHAWKER is shaving WEZ'S
          head. At the sound of the approaching prime mover,
          WEZ leaps to his feet, clambers over a tow truck on
          blocks and straddles his bike...
          Other MARAUDERS follow as we track to a SKINHEAD
          lying under the tow truck making noisy repairs.

          MAX burls the prime mover towards the rise above
          the compound.
          A dune buggy comes up alongside the rear passenger
          wheel. The SMEGMA CRAZY riding shotgun fires a
          crossbow arrow into a tyre... which explodes.
          WEZ appears on the road ahead as a road racer rockets
          from out of the scrub in front of the prime mover.
          MAX shunts it back off the road and into the rear of
          the tow truck on blocks.
          The tow truck crashes down, pinning the SKINHEAD
          beneath it.

          The gyrocopter sputters along, staying out of range
          of the MARAUDERS.
          The CAPTAIN is shouting advice and instructions from

                         THE SIDELINES:

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Watch your tyres! Turn left!
          Down over the CAPTAIN'S shoulder we see WEZ'S bike
          coming alongside the prime mover's rear wheels on
          the driver's side.
          76. THE ROAD APPROACHING THE RISE. tAY. 76.
           WEZ lifts his feet onto the saddle, steadies himself
           and leaps onto the back of the prime mover.
           As the vehicle crests the rise, MAX sees the camp
          below. He yanks the air horn lanyard...

          through the smashed front window of the truck and
          fires,.,
          The gun fizzes and pops - the cartridge was a dud.
          MAX ducks and yanks down hard on the wheel...
          The HUMUNGUS fires. The big gun kicks,,.
          The front of the prime mover bursts with steam and
          hot oil,
          The big machine careers off 'the road, and through
          a primitive tent. As the canvas rips away.,. we
          glimpse two startled MARAUDERS in the throes of
          hetereosexual love.
           MAX recovers, the big machine keeps going, rocketing
          down the hill 400 yards from the causeway...
           Suddenly a powerful arm bursts through the driver's
           window.,, and grabs MAX around the throat - its

          The DOG attacks WEZ, clamping his jaw around his
          gauntlet.

          A dune buggy with a machine gun like crossbow - the
          4-pak - fires four bolts into the t y'res. All but one
          tyre on the driver's side blow out.
          As the prime mover charges past, we track with the
          Lone Wolf, who drives a two-engined assault car.
          He yells to other Marauders behind:

          A street car and a dune buggy surge up beside him.
          In the background we see the DOG, running along

          vehicle into reverse...

          PAPPAGALLO sends the torrent of flames down on the
          retreating vehicle... as HUMUNGUS and the OTHER
          MARAUDERS hover at the entrance of the causeway...

          88., INSIDE THE COMPOUND THE CATWALK AREA. DAY. 88.
          The prime mover slides to a halt underneath a
          catwalk. -
          As SEVERAL CAMP PEOPLE run towards him, WEZ swings
          up onto the roof of the prime mover and onto the
          catwalk.
          The two Marauder vehicles stop in the middle of the
          compound.
          MAX jumps out of the prime mover assessing the
          situation. In addition to WEZ there are FOUR
          MARAUDERS inside the compound: the LONE WOLF,
          the LONE WOLF'S PASSENGER and TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES.

          89, THE BATTLEMENTS. DAY. 89.
          Undei the direction of the HUMUNGUS - HALF A DOZEN
          MARAUDERS come surging up the causeway on foot.
          PAPPAGALLO stands up on the very limit of the battle-
          ment and scares them off with a burst of flame.
          A MARAUDER fires an arrow..
          , .PAPPAGALLO is hit high up in the thigh. He
          tumbles backwards, off the parapet and crE.shes to the
          ground below.

          90, INSIDE THE. COMPOUND - THE CRACKING TOWER. DAY 90.
          Up on the catwalk WEZ is shouting at the FOUR

          OTHER INVADERS.

                         WEZ
          The gate! The gate! Move!!
          MAX looks around as the LONE WOLF, the LONE WOLF
          PASSENGER and the TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES start to sprint
          across the compound towards the gate...
          Thud! The LONE WOLF PASSENGER falls dead - an
          arrow in his back...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          9u. Cont. 90.
          WEZ spins around to see the QUIET MAN, standing
          on the cooling tower, reloading his bow.
          WEZ starts running towards him.

          91. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 91.
          With the help of the DOG, MAX tackles the-FIRST SMEGMA
          CRAZY who is running towards the gate. They land at
          the foot of the pump. The FERAL BOY, bouncing up and
          down on top of the pump looks down gleefully, as the
          FARMER, the BUTCHER and the CURMUDGEON descend on the

          MARAUDER.
          MAX is on his feet running towards PAPPAGALLO, as the
          second SMEGMA CRAZY is hit by the MECHANIC flying on
          the end of his lattice-arm contraption. ANGIE and
          PISMC, manning the other end, smile with satisfaction.

          92. INSIDE THE COMPOUND - THE CRACKING TOWER. DAY. 92.
          WEZ confronts the QUIET MAN who has his bow drawn,,,
          The QUIET MAN fires - WEZ ducks - missed!
          WEZ grins. The QUIET MAN is paralysed by indecision.
          WEZ is on him.., head-butts him - once, twice, three
          times,
          The QUIET MAN'S face is a torrent of blood as WEZ
          throws him of the cooling platform.
          The QUIET MAIL lands, groaning, badly injured.

          93. FROM INSIDE THE BUS. DAY. 93.
          The LONE WOLF has made it to the gate and smashes his
          way through the window - clawing at BIG REBECCA.
          She shoves a boot in his face as WARRIOR WOMAN drops
          onto him from the battlement above and buries a knife
          blade in his neck.

          MAX has picked up PAPPAGALLO'S flame thrower.
          PAPPAGALLO watches as he climbs the battlements,
          A DOZEN MARAUDERS are charging up the causeway.
          MAX appears above them,,, spraying fire. The
          MARAUDERS retreat...

          95, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 95â¢,
          WEZ grabs a cable and swings from the catwalk across
          the cracking tower to Pappagallo's 'dinosaur tent'.
          He slides down the tent, leaps onto some tyres, onto
          a storage tank and then onto the tanker...
          He hesitates a moment looking for some way to get to
          the gate...
          The WHOLE CAMP turns to confront him..-'.:'
          He ducks, the gyrocopter swoops down over his head
          and lands in the centre of the compound...
          An arrow flies past WEZ, then the Feral Kid's boomerang
          , , he decides to call it quits.
          Running along the top of the tanker, be leaps the
          barbed wire fence.

          9G THE L-ITCH. DAY. 96.
          WEZ lands in the ditch.
          He clambers over a wreck out of the ditch and out of
          range.

          97, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE TANKER. DAY.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN is up on the tanker, throwing a
          stick and shaking his fist at the MARAUDERS - putting
          on a show for the jubilant compound people.
          Several people shake hands with the GYRO CAPTAIN,
          The FERAL KID watches, puzzled, intrigued by this
          strange ritual.
          Sc. 97. Cont.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The MECHANIC is already examining the damage to the
          prime mover,
          PAPPAGALLO is propped up against the base of the
          battlement. BIG REBECCA and the WARRIOR WOMAN tend
          his thigh wound.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          OK! OK! Let's go.
          We leave tonight!
          The MECHANIC lifts his head out of the engine:

                         MECHANIC
          We got a hole through the
          radiator - into the
          timing case.
          Gonna take at least 24
          hours.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          You've got twelve.
          The crowd disperses.
          The QUIET MAN is carried to the bread van/medical
          centre; the bodies are removed; camp members load
          vehicles; men are working on the tanker.
          WARRIOR WOMAN climbs onto the battlement.

          98. THE BATTLEMENTS% DAY, 98.
          The MARAUDERS have regrouped on the rise.
          MAX is watching them, the flame thrower in his hands,
          as the WARRIOR WOMAN approaches him:

                         WARRIOR WOMAN
          I want you to know... that was
          a very brave thing you did...
          He doesn't reply - just hands her the flame thrower
          and descends the ladder.

          99. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 99.
          BIG REBECCA has just pulled the arrow out of
          PAPPAGALLO'S leg as MAX moves into view.
          PAPPAGALLO watches him walk towards the black-on
          -black - its nose poking out of the pyramid workshop,
          As MAX passes the gyrocopter we see the GYRO CAPTAIN
          in conversation with the CURMUDGEON.

                         CURMUDGEON
          .and tell me, son, this
          machine of yours - it takes
          two , does it?
          The GYRO CAPTAIN glances over the CURMUDGEON'S
          shoulder at LUSTY who is admiring the gyrocopter.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          er... possibly.
          The FERAL KID steps forward, holding his hand out
          stiffly to MAX.
          MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID
          laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious.
          As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL
          KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky,
          stiff-legged gait.

          1.00, INT. PYRAMID WORKSHOP. LATE AFTERNOON. 100.

          Through the maze of pipes in the peak of the pyramid,
          we have a high angle down on MAX working on the
          black-on-black below.
          The FERAL KID comes into view in the foreground,
          climbing along the pipes.
          The KID is softly humming a tune - approximating the
          first few notes of "Happy Birthday".
           On the workshop floor a small siphon pump is transfer-
          ring fuel from a 44 gallon drum into the black-on-
          black's fuel tanks.
          MAX is re-arming the booby traps - connecting a
          string of wires and fuses to the gas tank caps. His
          utility belt and jacket are off and he has laid his
          personal. effects on a nearby work bench.
          In the background, through the arched doorway we see
          Sc. 100. Cont.

          the MECHANIC and his TEAM working on the truck with
          arc welders, lights and so on.
          MAX looks up:
          The CURMUDGEON is leading PAPPAGALLO'into the workshop.

                         CURMUDGEON
          See! I told ya. I said he
          was leaving.
          High up in the pyramid the FERAL KID starts to swing
          down the pipes - towards the bench where MAX has laid
          his jacket and utility belt. On the floor, PAPPAGALLO

                         CONFRONTS MAX:

                         PAPPAGALLO
          I don't have time for thanks.
          You know what you did out _
          there and what it means to us.
          Come with us, MAX. Drive the
          tanker.
          MA:. continues to work - muffling the four exhausts
          by plugging them with rags.

                         MAX
          We had a contract. I did
          my job, I got my car and I
          got my gas. End of story.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          It doesn't have to be -
          we'll make a new contract.
          I can offer you a chance to
          rebuild your life, I can
          offer you a future.
          The CURMUDGEON breaks in, excited.

                         CURMUDGEON
          You gotta come. Look!
          He produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which
          bears the heading:

          GREETINGS FROM THE

                         SUNSHINE COAST

                         

                         

                         

                         
          100. Cont. 100.
          The FERAL KID's arm sneaks across the work bench
          reaching out for the hurdy-gurdy.
          MAX'S hand snaps out and clamps around the KID'S
          wrist. The FERAL KID drops the hurdy-gurdy. As
          MAX releases his grip the KID retreats into the
          shadows.
          The CURMUDGEON unravels the postcard pictures in
          front of MAX'S face. -

                         CURMUDGEON
          This is where we're going.
          Two thousand miles away.
          "Bloody paradise. Fresh
          water... plenty of sunshine...
          nothing to do but breed...
          MAX starts to go back to his work.
          PAPPAGALLO takes him by the shoulder.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          What are you looking for
          out there? How long do
          you expect to survive,
          scavenging day to day?
          You're no different than them.
          He points in the direction of the Marauders.,.
          ..,vultures, maggots.
          Don't you see? There is
          a better way!
          MAX flares at him, angry:

                         MAX
          Yeah. I tried it once!
          Now forget it, 'cos I
          never get involved.
          I'm leaving. I leave
          tonight.
          PAPPAGALLO is about to reply when a scream echoes
          through the camp.
          They all turn to look: the men working on the prime
          mover are running towards the battlement,
          An ominous drumming begins in the Marauders' camp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3GI.. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE CATWALK. DUSK. 101.
          PAPPAGALLO climbs onto part of the refinery's cat-
          walk which is close to the workshop area.
          SEVERAL OTHER CAMP MEMBERS, including the GYRO
          CAPTAIN, and LUSTY, are already there - looking
          across no-man's land.
          The MARAUDERS are raising two tall poles. TWO OF
          THE CAMP MEMBERS captured that morning are nailed
          to the poles screaming.
          PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX, who is still down at the
          black-on-black.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          You see! That's the
          alternative!
          Men feeding on men.
          MAX goes back to work.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN slips his arm around LUSTY'S
          shoulder.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          I know you're afraid darlin'.
          But I'll let you into a
          secret, sweetheart. I'm
          afraid too.
          He squeezes her tight. She caresses his hand.

          DISSOLVE.

          1.02. NO MAN'S LAND. NIGHT, 102.
          Silhouetted against a large fire, near the two
          poles, a group of TWELVE !.MARAUDERS of various
          breeds beat out a tattoo on the panels of their
          cars. The HUMUNGUS watches as two more victims
          are raised on poles. The beat becomes more
          frenzied,

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pouring with sweat, MAX tears up the first of a
          series of metal plates which form the floor of the
          workshop area.
          He drags it.across the compound, passing the
          MECHANIC'S TEAM working in a shower of sparks on
          the prime mover.
          The MECHANIC looks up:

                         MECHANIC -
          Go on! Go! Just another mercenary!
          He spits.
          MAX ignores him, dragging the plate past Pappagallo's
          tent. It is crowded with CAMP PEOPLE, laying their
          plans for escape.
          They fall silent, turning to watch MAX.

          104, COMPOUND WALL. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 104.
          The black-on-black waits next to the fence, near the
          place where the Mohawkers attempted to build the
          "bridge of cars" across the ditch.
          MAX has cut a hole in the barbed wire and is
          manouevrin6 the metal plate on top of the first car
          starting to build a ramp from thw,
          compound, over the top of the cars and onto the far
          side of the ditch.

          105, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. LATER THAT NIGHT. 105
          The HUMUNGUS has stepped up his theatrics of terror.
          His voice booms across the night - reciting dark
          poetic descriptions of death and hell.
          The CAMP PEOPLE, gathered in Pappagallo's tent, watch
          as the GYRO CAPTAIN walks towards the spot where MAX
          is working. PAPPAGALLO sits at his desk,flicki.ng an
          egg timer: the sand trickling from one end to the
          other.

          MAX, who is locking the last metal plate into
          position, looks up at the GYRO CAPTAIN.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          I just want you to know that
          I don't agree with them,
          He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          I don't think you're a coward.
          A bit stupid - but not a
          coward,
          Where else you gonna find
          what we 've got here?
          Food... fuel... clean women.
          MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches
          to the ramp.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Men, too, if that's your
          inclination.
          Jesus! All we've got to

          I know you can. I saw you
          out there. Stay with us
          Max. Drive the tanker.
          MAX gets up, snaking his head.

                         MAX
          I haven't got time to explain.
          Just believe me - I've got
          everything I want.
          The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him
          short.

                         MAX
          Good luck tomorrow.
          I hope you make it.

          â¢ The CAPTAIN, a little surprised, shakes hands with
          him.

                         GYRO CAPTAIN
          Thanks. Thanks a lot.
          The CAPTAIN walks back towards the GROUP watching
          from Pappagallo's tent. He shrugs his shoulders.
          MAX opens the door of the black-on-black.

          107. OUTSIDE THE _OMPOUND. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 107.
          MAX eases the black car onto the metal plates.
          The wide wheels rumble slowly across the makeshift
          bridge.
          MAX revs the motor to get over the last hump, the
          plugs in the exhausts muffling the sound of the big
          engine.
          The Humungus's bizarre ravings continue to boom across
          the wasteland.

          108, THE WASTELAND NEAR THE COMPOUND.NIGHT. 108.
          The black-on-black eases away from the compound.
          The DOG is edgy, growling. MAX takes hold of his
          shotgun,
          There is a thump! Something lands on the roof.
          The DOG flies at the window snarling. MAX jams the
          barrel against the roof.
          A face appears, leaning over the windscreen, peering
          in at MAX. It's the FERAL KID,
          He grins and tumbles through the passenger's window.
          He grabs hold of MAX'S hand, shaking it.
          The FERAL KID laughs, settling in to the seat.
          The car continues to roll forward.

          Scat! Go back.
          The FERAL KID looks at him, puzzled, then throws his
          head back, howling.
          MAX stops the car, looking round, nervous.
          The first light of dawn appears on the horizon.
          MAX turns to the FERAL KID:

                         MAX
          You're a fine kid, but you
          can't come. You've gotta
          learn - don't get close to
          people. It can churn you
          up...
          The KID can't understand a word, so just grins.
          MAX thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces
          the hurdy-gurdy.
          He shoves it into the FERAL KID'S hands, opens the
          door and pushes him out.

          109. THE WASTELAND. DAWN.
          As the FERAL KID gets to his feet the black-on-black
          accelerates away, surging up the rise towards the
          Humungus encampment.
          The rapid burst of power fires the four plugs out of
          the exhausts. The big engine roars.

          110. THE RISE ABOVE THE COMPOUND. DAWN. 110.
          WEZ springs to his feet. His face covered in a
          white war paint. His eyes searching out the
          darkness. He starts running,.. towards the
          Humungus machine.

          A GAYBOY BERSERKER is running with him. As they climb
          into the vehicle, the HUMUNGUS - sitting on a rock near
          the VICTIMS on the poles - gets to his feet,
          He bellows with rage as WEZ drives the vehicle off in
          pursuit of Max. The TWO VICTIMS, still strapped to the
          front, lift their heads.
          i11.. THE HUMUNGUS MACHINE. DAWN.
          From the Humungus machine WEZ sees six other vehicles
          stream across the landscape in pursuit of the black-on
          -black. (One tow truck, two dune buggies, two street
          cars and a bike).
          The TOADIE emerges bewildered from where he has been
          sleeping under the fuel tanks of the Humungus machine.

          112.

          112. A ROAD NEAR THE COMPOUND. DAWN.
          The black-on-black achieves the road...
          The DOG is looking back through the passenger window
          as we see the first of the pursuing vehicles rumble
          onto the road...
          MAX hits the supercharger switch...
          The big engine whines up.
          Once again, the DOG climbs down under the seat.
          The Humungus machine rockets onto the road... and
          begins to overtake the other six Marauder vehicles
          one by one...

          MAX is giving the black-on-black all its got...
          In the Humungus machine WEZ, the GAYBOY BERSERKER
          and the TOADIE have left the rest of the Marauders
          well behind...
          The big machine seems to be encroaching on the black-

          WEZ shouts instructions to the GAYBOY BERSERKER who
          comes to his side.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER slides behind the wheel as WEZ
          clambers forward onto the front of the vehicle.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER reaches down. His hand rests on a
          toggle switch next to three gas bottles marked:

                         NITROUS OXIDE
          At the front of the vehicle WEZ grabs a huge exhaust
          pipe jutting into the air. In spite of the heat he tears
          the pipe off the mounting. He signals to the GAYBOY

          BERSERKER.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER flicks down the toggle switch:
          there is a mighty roar matched by a massive surge of
          power in the Humungus machine...
          The TWO VICTIMS on the front scream... MAX is bewildered
          by the massive acceleration. ._
           The Humungus machine leaps alongside the black-on-black.
           WEZ swings the chrome pipe down through the front
          windscreen -, into MAX'S face.

          114. A CURVE IN THE HIGHWAY. MORNING. 1.14.
           The black-on-black takes out a guide post and leases
           the road... rolling over and over.
           Inside the car MAX - his face bloodied - and the DOG
           are slammed around in the cabin of the black-on-black.
          It continues rolling, over and over again, into a gully.

          115, THE CREEK BED. MORNING. 115.
          What is left of the car comes to rest, upside down,
          among the boulders of a dry creek bed. MAX is slumped,
          dangling in his harness - his face and body bloodied
          and broken. Somthing moves... it's the DOG pulling
          himself out of the wreckage. He licks and paws at
          MAX'S face. One eye flickers open.

                         AN

          WEZ stands looking down into the gully. Another vehicle
          has arrived. TWO GAYBOY BERSERKERS and the TOADIE
          scramble down towards the wreck carrying jerry cans.

                         WE-
          Don't waste him. If he's
          alive I want him.

          117. THE CREEK BED. MORNING. 117.
          By an enormous force of will, MAX frees himself from the
          harness and - as the sound of the Marauders approaches -
          pulls himself through the window of the wreck.
          He falls to the ground, dragging his crippled body into
          the shadow of a large boulder, hiding there.
          The DOG confronts the MARAUDERS, snarling, standing
          between them and the wreck.
          One of the GAYBOY BERSERKERS raises his crossbow...
          MAX watches, grim-faced, as the DOG falls dead.
          The THREE MARAUDERS run to the vehicle.
          While the TOADIE prepares to siphon off the gas, the
          other two peer into the crushed cabin.
          Perplexed, they examine the wreck more closely, looking
          for MAX.. .
          ONE of them sees the drag marks, leading down the
          creek bed.
          He signals to the OTHER MARAUDER... MAX prepares to defend
          himself... the TOADIE prises the cap off the black car's
          fuel tank.
          The booby trap explodes... the petrol ignites... the
          THREE MARAUDERS are engulfed by a giant fireball.
          MAX looks pa3t the flames, staring up at WEZ,
          not taking his eyes off him...

          118, ROADSIDE. MORNING. 118.
          WEZ and the OTHER MARAUDERS watch the great pillar of
          smoke rise up into the sky.
          They return to their vehicles.

          In the background we see the camp vehicles standing
          ready - fully loaded. The Mechanic's TEAM are still
          working on the prime mover.
          As PISMO shows from the tower, the GYRO CAPTAIN looks
          up to see the smoke from the wreck rising into the sky.

          Foot by foot, MAX drags himself alor:g the creekbed -
          heading for the compound. Blood seeps from wounds on
          his head and face. His legs are useless, his hands
          heavily bandaged with strips from his leather jacket.
          Behind him, in the distance, we see the still-
          smouldering wreck of the black-on-black.
          MAX struggles on, the pain growing, the sun climbing,
          the temperature soaring. His mind becomes more feverish:
          the wasteland dissolves into the heat haze; the buzz
          of the flies around his face becomes the steady drone
          of an engine.
          The gyrocopter appears above him.

          121. ON BOARD THE GYROCOPTER. DAY. 121.
          MAX, strapped to the chassis of the gyrocopter, drifts
          back to consciousness.
          He sees the compound surging towards them as they come
          in to land.
          He drifts back into unconsciousness, the images
          distorting, dissolving,..

          122. INSIDE THE COMPOUND. THE BREAD VAN. DAY.- 122.
          MAX'S eyes flicker open to a slow, distorted version of

                         'HAPPY BIRTHDAY"
          As he fights to make sense of his surroundings, we see
          that his wounds have been stitched and dressed.
          He lifts his head, looking through the back door of
          the bread van.

                         GURDY
          Then, beyond the KID, coming into clear focus, he sees
          the prime mover attached to the tanker.
          The tanker now sports a 'cow-catcher' on the front,
          armour-plating on the bonnet, steel aprons on the wheels
          and a barbed wire net along each side.
          MAX'S vision clears. He sees PAPPAGALLO-on the catwalk
          addressing the CAMP PEOPLE.
          MAX drops his bead back and looks to one side: a bloated
          faces stares back at him.
          The QUIET MAN, is lying unconscious on a stretcher next
          to him.
          MAX lifts his head urgently and looks around. He realises
          that he is in the bread van. The canopy has been removed
          and his stretcher is supported by a collection of 44 gallon
          drums.

          123. INSIDE THE COMPOUND - THE CATWALK. DAY. 123,
          PAPPAGALLO paces the catwalk as he gives final
          instructions to the CAMP PEOPLE gathered below.

                         PAPPAGALLO
          We're going to use the tanker
          and the two assault vehicles to
          punch our way out of here.
          If I'm right, they'll all go
          after the tanker. That'll give
          the rest of you a chance.

          MAX is sitting up, binding his leg tight with
          bandages, clipping on his metal knee brace.

          As MAX struggles to haul himself out of the bread van,
          the FERAL KID hands him his equipment belt.

          Blood seeps through the bandage on his leg.

          But! Only give us 'til sunset.
          If we haven't made it by then,
          keep going!
          PAPPAGALLO swings down off the catwalk, heading for the
          cabin of the tanker.
          The meeting breaks up - the CAMP PEOPLE moving to take
          up their positions on the various vehicles.

                         MAX
          I'll drive the tanker...
          Everybody stops, turning to look at him.
          MAX is staring at PAPPAGALLO, swaying slightly, hands
          clenched,

          Until you're clear of

          The tanker stands at the far end of the compound. Behind
          it, the GYRO CAPTAIN is spinning the rotor of his machine.
          A dune buggy and the Lone Wolf's car - armour-plated
          since being captured by the camp - wait on either side
          of the tanker.
          Beyond the gate the MARAUDERS have formed an arc of

          WARRIOR WOMAN stands on the running board.
          She turns as the MECHANIC clambers on board. He glares

          PAPPAGALLO starts the assault vehicle.
          WARRIOR WOMAN finds the FERAL KI.D crouched down in
          her position behind the protective plate. Holding
          the KID by his arm, she passes him down to MAX who
          passes him down to the ground... PAPPAGALLO yells
          for someone to come and take him...
          The LUSTY GIRL runs forward... the FERAL KID avoids
          her. MAX engages the engine. The tanker rumbles
          forward, gathering speed as it runs the length of the
          compound. BIG REBECCA, at the wheel of the school bus
          draws the vehicle aside - revealing the burnt out
          wreck of the road racer on the causeway and the
          MARAUDERS beyond.

          130. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND.__ DAY. 130.
          The HUMUNGUS has opened his gun case and removes the
          magnum 44. The remaining 4 bullets have been
          placed in the revolving chamber...

          131.

          131, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY.
          The dune buggy and the Lone Wolf machine follow close
          behind the tanker.
          The FERAL KID leaps onto the back of Pappagallo's
          vehicle.

          131. Cont. 131,
          The WARRIOR WOMAN and the MECHANIC lie low as the
          tanker roars out the gate, ploughing through the
          burnt out wreck,"knocking it into the ditch.
          The HUMUNGUS, raises his gun, calmly taking aim at the
          oncoming tanker...
          As the tanker accelerates towards him, the gyrocopter
          swoops out of the compound and over the MARAUDERS.
          The GYRO CAPTAIN drops three burning molotov cocktails.
          They fall in and around a road racer at one end of
          the arc... the road racer bursts into flames...
          The GYRO CAPTAIN whoops with delight.

          1.32. THE BREAK OUT. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND. DAY. 132.
          With the Lone Wolf machine and the dune buggy close
          alongside, MAX steers the tanker towards the burning
          road racer.
          The HUMUNGUS fires... once...
          The bullet dents the protective plate mounted on the
          front of the tanker but does no further damage.
          Twice... three times!
          Two more dents,
          The tanker keeps going crashing through the burning
          wreck... breaking the Marauders' cordon...

          133. ON BOARD THE BYROCOPTER. DAY. 133,
          The GYRO CAPTAIN has banked around and is swooping low.
          Having swung around, the GYRO CAPTAIN, swoops down,
          taking aim on the Humungus machine with another fistful.
          of lighted bottles.
          The HUMUNGUS looks up. He swings the revolver up,
          taking aim at the approaching gyrocopter.
          He fires!
          The bullet hits, piercing the right rudder peddle.
          Dropping his bottles, the GYRO CAPTAIN screams and
          looks down: blood pours from what is left of his
          right foot.

          MAX glances up to see the gyrocopter, flying ezaatically,,
          swoop over and bank away towards the horizon..
          On top of the tanker WARRIOR WOMAN and the MECHANIC
          prepare to fire their weapons.
          Behind them, the HUMUNGUS and his HORDE power over the
          rise, pursuing the tanker.
          Suddenly, three of the Marauder vehicles skid to a halt,
          They start to turn back towards the compound, where the
          remaining camp vehicles are making their bid for freedom.
          The bread van and three other vehicles have followed the
          yellow school bus out onto the causeway.
          They skirt round the back of the compound and head off
          across country.
          The HUMUNGUS screams at his men through the amplifier:

                         HUMUNGUS
          The tanker! All on the tanker!
          As the three Marauder vehicles turn to rejoin the
          tanker chase... whoomp! a massive flash fills the
          sky. The camp erupts in flame, followed by a series
          of rolling explosions.
          The camp people have destroyed what they cannot take ...

          WIPE.

          1.35. DUNE BUGGY INCIDENT. HIGHWAY. DAY. 135,
          As the tanker surges towards us, we see the dune
          buggy, the Lone Wolf' machine and the pursuing
          MARAUDERS, surrounding it.
          MAX grimaces as he changes gears. His leg is bleeding
          freely now...
          He looks to the passenger-side:
          The dune buggy, driven by the BLACKSMITH and manned
          by PISMO, leaps onto the road in front of=the tanker.
          A tow truck, manned by SKINHEADS, converges on it from
          the driver's side.

          13S. Cont. 135 ,
          On the back of the dune buggy PISMO lifts his crossbow...
          unaware that, behind him, Wez's convertible tow truck
          â¢ is approaching fast.
          The FIRST OF THE TWO SKINHEADS on the back of the tow
          truck fires his crossbow.,,
          The arrow sails past PISMO'S ear. PISMO fires.., He
          hits the FIRST SKINHEAD but the arrow bounces off the
          SKINHEAD'S protective armour. The SKINHEAD grins.
          PISMO hurries to reload...
          The SECOND SKINHEAD raises his bow, aiming at PISMO.
          An arrow hits the SECOND SKINHEAD in the back of the
          head.
          PISMO looks up to see WARRIOR WOMAN reloading her
          longbow.
          PISMO grins at her... behind him, WETS arm reaches
          down and hooks the jib chain around the roll bar of the
          dune buggy...
          The tow truck accelerates... the chain tightens...
          PISMO screams as he is thrown through the air.
          WEZ'S tow truck drags the dune buggy askew...
          It rolls in front of the tanker... MAX has no choice.
          The cow catcher shunts the dune buggy aside, sending it
          tumbling off the road.
          MAX struggles with the wheel,., managing to keep the
          vehicle on the road.,.
          He looks down in the side mirror: two road racers and
          a dune buggy - followed by the Humungus machine - surge
          up behind the tanker.
          From behind protective plates on top of the tanker the
          MECHANIC hurls a molotov cocktail...
          The FARMER, stationed at the rear of the tanker does
          the same...
          The two bottles smash into the first road racer. It
          bursts into flames... swerves in front of the other
          road racer, ramps off the road and plunges into a
          Marauder's dune buggy.
          PAPPAGALLO, who has been forced off the road, narrowly
          avoids the wreck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          136. MAX LOSES HIS DOOR. DAY. 136 .
          The Skinhead tow truck draws alongside the tanker,
          near Max' s door.
          The SECOND SKINHEAD, twirling a grappling hook, lets
          it fly.
          It trails out towards the tanker cabin,.. flies through
          the driver's window.., and lands virtually in MAX'S lap...
          As the tow truck swerves away from the tanker the cable
          tightens.
          The grappling hook drags across MAX'S arm, tearing away
          part of the sleeve and hooks onto the door...
          The tow truck brakes... Max's door is ripped off its
          hinges...

          137. THE REAR OF THE TANKER INCIDENT. DAY.' 137,
          A SMEGMA CRAZY riding in the cabin of the tow truck
          is encouraged by this success...
          He begins twirling his grappling hook as the vehicle
          approaches the back of the tanker...
          The FARMER pops up from behind a protective plate and
          fires his crossbow...
          The arrow-misses the tow truck, flies through the caged
          window of a road racer armed with a 4-pak and lodges
          in the driver's helmet.
          The DRIVER pulls off his helmet... the arrow has barely
          creased his scalp.
          The S14EGMA CRAZY hurls his grappling hook...
          It caches the FARMER by the leg and hooks on to the
          lip of the back protective plate.
          The cable snaps taut, the FARMER screams.
          MAX feels the sudden tug on the tanker, He changes
          down...
          The tow truck is dragged along, veering out of control.
          The strain pops the rivets off the tanker's back plate.
          it comes away in one piece... carrying away the FARMER
          and the steel aprons protecting the rear wheels...
          The tow truck tumbles and rolls...

          138, THE MECHANIC DROPS THE BOTTLE. DAY. 138,
           On top of the tanker, the MECHANIC has lit another
          molotov cocktail...
          He swings back to throw...
          The road racer, armed with the 4-pak'swings alongside
          and fires.
          Three arrows rat-a-tat against the protective plates.
          the fourth hits the MECHANIC'S upraised arm...
          The bottle drops... and smashes on top of the tanker...
          spreading flames.
          The HUMUNGUS accelerates hard towards the now-undefended
          rear of the tanker. He pulls a rope, whipping the hoods
          off the heads of the TWO VICTIMS lashed to the front.
          They scream as the back of the tanker looms in front of
          them.

          139. WEZ TAKES OUT THE FIRST TYRE.DAY. 139.
          MAX looks in the passenger-side mirror...
          Wez's convertible tow truck is drawing alongside the
          left rear wheels of the prime mover.
          WEZ fires an arrow into the first tyre...
          It explodes,,. flailing cable and rubber.,.
          As WEZ reloads, another MOHAWKER - wearing two bizarre
          bear claws on his crossbow gauntlets - steadies himself
          on the back of the tow truck... ready to jump aboard
          the tanker.
          Pappagallo's Lone Wolf machine appears in the background.

          140, WARRIOR WOMAN IS SHOT. DAY. 1,40.
          WARRIOR WOMAN turns to see that the MECHANIC is losing
          the battle with the flames. In vain he tries to stop
          his clothes catching alight,..
          Rising to her feet WARRIOR WOMAN fires an arrow at the
          BEAR CLAW BIKER... hitting him in his protective pads
          throwing him off balance.
          As WARRIOR WOMAN scrambles along the top of the tanker
          towards the MECHANIC, TWO MARAUDERS fire at her,

          She is hit, once in the protective plate around her
          kidneys and once in the thigh.,,
          From the Lone Wolf vehicle PAPPAGALLO and the FERAL
          KID watch as she staggers forward,..
          In the tow truck, WEZ has reloaded and fires at WARRIOR
          WOMAN. The arrow hits her in the back... she buckles
          and falls into the barbed wire.
          MAX watches helplessly in the rear vision mirror as
          she struggles in the wire.

          141. CONVERTIBLE TOW TRUCK. DAY. 141.
          As WEZ reloads his crossbow, the Lone Wolf machine
          accelerates alongside the tow truck.
          The KID throws his steel boomerang... Yiitting Wez's
          crossbow gauntlet, preventing him from aiming.
          The MASKED MOHAWKER driving the tow truck turns to see...
          PAPPAGALLO firing his gauntlet crossbow.
          The MASKED MOHAWKER screams as the arrow passes through
          his neck...
          The convertible tow truck swerves in and bounces off the
          tanker.
          WEZ is thrown off balance...
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER grabs the barbed wire on the side
          of the tanker for support...
          The tow truck swerves away, out of control, leaving
          the BEAR CLAW BIKER clinging to the wire,
          WEZ scrambles over into the driver's seat, bringing
          the vehicle back under control.

          142. WARRIOR WOMAN AND THE MECHANIC. DAY. 1.42.
          WARRIOR WOMAN, caught in the wire by her clothing,
          struggles to remain conscious as she slips-closer to
          the tanker's wheels.
          The MECHANIC, who has managed to extinguish the flames,
          crawls towards her. Her clothing tearing... his hand
          reaches out... further... further... and grabs her.
          A road racer draws alongside them.

          MAX yells as he sees the driver - a GAYBOY BERSERKER -
          fire another arrow into the MECHANIC.
          The MECHANIC shudders, the WARRIOR WOMAN slips - her
          weight dragging them both off the tanker.

          143, MAX ATTACKS. DAY. 143,
          MAX, enraged, tears off the sling which supports his
          wrist. He grabs the shotgun off the seat next to him.
          He swings the gun around then pumps both barrels into
          the road racer: the first blast shatters the windscreen
          the second blows off the bonnet...
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER is unharmed.
          MAX hauls down hard on the wheel...
          The tanker swerves into the road racer, taking it
          through a guide post and into the 'rough'...
          The tanker barrels over the road racer, rolling it,
          tumbling it into another Marauder's vehicle.
          MAX changes down and hurls the tanker back onto the
          highway. The BEAR CLAW BIKER hangs on desperately...
          MAX grabs two of the four remaining cartridges and
          quickly reloads the shotgun.

          143. BOARDING THE TANKER. DAY. 143.
          The Humungus machine draws up behind the undefended
          tanker.
          A GAYBOY BERSERKER clambers to the front of the
          Humungus vehicle - between the TWO VICTIMS - and leaps
          onto the back of the tanker.
          Further along the tanker, a MOHAWK BIKER with PILLION
          RIDER has drawn alongside. The PILLION RIDER helps the
          BEAR CLAW BIKER swing up above the wire...
          Once he is on top, the BEAR CLAW BIKER hauls the PILLION
          RIDER on board.
          The MOHAWK BIKER accelerates alongside the leading set
          of wheels - one of which has already been blown apart.
          He raises his bow taking aim...
          The flying steel belt of the shreaded tyre lashes around
          his arm, dragging him and his bike beneath the rig...

          144. UNDER THE TANKER. DAY. 144.
          On its way through the bike has ruptured a small hose
          underneath the tanker. We see something trickling out
          of the tank... streaming down the road.
          It's sand!

          145. THE MARAUDERS ON BOARD. DAY. 145.
          On board the tanker, the GAYBOY BERSERKER scrambles
          towards the cabin, leaping the gap between the tank
          and the prime mover...
          MAX looks up at the 'thump' overhead...
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER braces himself, taking aim through
          the roof... he fires...
          The arrow rips through the metal and buries itself in
          the seat between MAX'S legs...
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER prepares to reload.
          MAX brakes...
          The HUMUNGUS, tailgating him, isn't quick enough. The
          front of his vehicle smacks one corner of the tanker,
          crushing the BROKEN MAN strapped to the front.
          The GAYBOY BERSERKER on the roof pitches forward,
          falling past the windscreen and out of sight over the
          front of the tanker...
          The PILLION RIDER and BEAR CLAW BIKER scramble and
          fall..
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER catches hold of an outlet valve
          and steadies himself..,

          146, THE GYRO CAPTAIN AGAIN. DAY 146.
           On the crest of a hill about 400 yards ahead, MAX
          sees another vehicle.
          The gyrocopter stands in the middle of the road
          facing away from the chase...
          The GYRO CAPTAIN has bandaged his foot and is trying to
          repair the right rudder peddle...
          As the chase looms up behind him he turns... we see
          that the GAYBOY BERSERKER is clinging to the cow-
          catcher on the front of the tanker.
          Furiously, the GYRO CAPTAIN starts spinning the rotor
          by hand, turning over the motor.
          As the tanker bears down on him he takes off - so
          steeply that he almost stalls.
          Once he is airborne he looks down... assessing, cursing.
          Down below we see Pappagallo's Lone Wolf vehicle draw
          alongside Wez's convertible tow truck.

          147. OFF ROAD. THE FERAL KID FALLS. DAY. 147.
          WEZ looks over his shoulder...
          PAPPAGALLO comes alongside... the FERAL KID, standing
          on the back of the machine, hands him a crossobw.
          WEZ wrenches down hard on the wheel... shunting into
          the Lone Wolf vehicle... sending Pappagallo's arrow
          astray...
          The FERAL KID loses his footing, tumbling off the side
          of the vehicle.
          PAPPAGALLO turns in dismay... as WEZ comes in to
          shunt him again...

          A bike with a side car accelerates alongside the tanker.
          The SIDECAR RIDER fires and takes out another tyre...
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER signals, calling for a weapon.
          The SIDE CAR RIDER throws him a large, powerful
          crossbow.
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER catches it and starts to haul himself
          onto the roof of the cabin.

          which leads to the top of the tanker.

          In the scrub ahead - over WEZ'S shoulder - we see an

          wheel...
          The tow truck and the Lone Wolf machine go into a
          slide...
          WEZ manages to avoid the ditch and keep going but the

          bringing the vehicle to an abrupt halt...

          As MAX looks back, a hand comes over the front bull bar
          of the tanker, followed by the GAYBOY BERSERKER'S bead.
          He sees the BEAR CLAW BIKER and signals for the crossbow...
          the BEAR CLAW BIKER throws it...
          The crossbow lands on the bonnet...

          MAX raises the shotgun, firing point blank at the
          SIDE CAR RIDER, blowing him away.
          Immediately he fires the second barrel through the
          roo4f. the blast hurls the SMEGMA CRAZY off the back
          of the cabin.
          MAX breaks open the barrel...
          MAX grabs his last two shells as a muscled arm reaches
          through the open door. MAX recoils. It is the BEAR
          CLAW BIKER. The cartridges fall to the floor.
          The BEAR CLAW rips the seat next to MAX'S right shoulder.
          MAX zig-zags the tanker down the highway trying to keep
          the BEAR CLAW off his balance.
          Thud! The BEAR CLAW strikes again - this time - through
          the rear window into Max's shoulder padding,..
          The BEAR CLAW BIKER'S foot slips, MAX screams with pain
          as the claws dig into his left shoulder.
          The BEAR CLAW hangs there unable to move.
          MAX tries desperately to reach the two cartridge shells

          On the front of the tanker the GAY BOY BERSERKER pokes

          He swings a 4-pak around on its axis and fires.
          Three of the four arrows hit the gyrocopter in its
          under-belly...
          The aircraft makes a terrible noise and dips radically,
          dropping down towards the tanker.

          Up ahead on the left, we see Wez's tow truck drawing
          alongside the tanker.
          Pieces of tyre are flailing everywhere... the tanker is
          down on one side... slowing...

          All this - and no guzzolene.
          WEZ, pale with fury, speaks softly:

          I know where there's guzzolene,
          WEZ whirls around and fires his crossbow,,.
          The arrow buries itself in the HUMUNGUS'S mask...
          The big man crumbles to the ground, dead.
          The rest of the HORDE are arriving. As their vehicles
          screech to a halt TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES and TWO GAYBOY
          BERSERKERS leap out, waving their Jerry cans in the air.
          WEZ, the SECOND MOHAWKER and TWO OTHERS, open fire.

          Through the screaming motor we hear Pappagallo laughing,
          almost hysterical.
          As MAX eases himself down into the cockpit.

                         PAPPAGALLO TURNS:

          The fuel was with the others.
          It's already at Powder River.
          MAX reaches across and cuts the engine... the vehicle
          rolls to a stop...
          MAX g-abs PAPPAGALLO.

                         MAX
          What happened to the boy?!

          our only chance.
          MAX raises the Bear Claw arm to PAPPAGALLO'S face.
          We see that the crossbow strapped to the forearm is
          still loaded.

          WEZ is sitting at the wheel of the Humungus machine.
          He and the THREE OTHER MARAUDERS - all on-.bikes -
          accelerate away from the tanker. Dead bodies litter
          the ground.
          WEZ urges the OTHER THREE on - pursuing the Lone
          Wolf machine.
          As the Humungus machine winds around the bends, we see,
          the Lone Wolf vehicle approaching over a distant hillcrest.

           away, approaching at terrific speed...
           MAX steels himself... 300 yards.
           The two vehicles are on direct collision course... 200
          yards...
           The two victims have been taken from the front of the
           Humungus machine and something else is in their place...
           MAX sees that it is the FERAL KID, lashed there - upside
          down...
          He throws the wheel, sending the vehicle into a slide,
          spinning clear of the Humungus machine.
          The Lone Wolf vehicle spins around... Thud! into the
          bikes of TWO MARAUDERS flanking WEZ.
          The third - a MOHAWK BIKER - follows WEZ,
          As soon as MAX has the Lone Wolf machine under control,
          he guns the two engines un,s is off after WEZ. He hits

                         

                         

                         

                         

          171. HUMUNGUS MACHINE. DAY. 171.
          As the vehicle approaches we see the KID, his head inches
          off the bitumen... WEZ looks back to see MAX overtaking
          the MOHAWK BIKER.

          172. THE LONE WOLF MACHINE.DAY 172.
          As MAX overtakes the MOHAWK BIKER, he twitches the
          wheel... the big car swipes the bike.., sending the
          MOHAWKER sailing off the road.
          The Lone :Wolf surges away, catching up to the Humungus
          machine.
          173. HU1!UNGUS MACHINE. tAY. 173.
           WEZ looks back at the approaching machine. He floors
           the accelerator, "red-lining" the engine...
           As the Humungus machine surges into camera we do a
           track, in zoom, on the FERAL KID'S face, turning the
           camera through 180 degrees.

          174. THE KID'S UPSIDE DOWN POINT OF VIEW. DAY. 174.
          We are upside down as we rocket along the curving,
          undulating, highway, through a flock of birds...
          towards a puddle of water... as the water splashes on
          the lens...

                         CUT TO:
          The Humungus vehicle as it roars through the water,
          passing a startled PAPPAGALLO walking along the road,..
          SAX rockets past moments later.

          175. THE LONE WOLF MACHINE.DAY . 175.
          MAX raises the Bear Claw arm as he closes in on WEZ,
          drawing alongside the Humungus machine ... I.

                         ALL

                         

                         

                         

                         
          I /b . '1.1 HUNIUNU ,a MACHI.NL. DAY . .176,
          WEZ reaches down... to the toggle switch next to the
          nitrous oxide bottles... waiting for the right moment, .
          He flicks the switch...
          He is thrown back by the massive acceleration... the
          Humungus machine surges away from camera...

          177. THE LONE WOLF MACHINE. DAY, 17Z.
          MAX doesn't have time to aim the crossbow still attached
          to the bear claw arm.
          He fires, the arrow disappearing in a blurr...
          The Humungus machine thunders away, rocketing along the
          open highway... eating up the white line...
          Upside down, the FERAL KID is terror-struck: the
          Humungus machine roars straight into a wide curve,
          leaving the road, continuing out into the wasteland.
          The Humungus machine charges through the salt bush..

          178, THE LONE WOLF CAR. DAY. 178.
          Over MAX'S shoulder, we see that the vehicle is
          slowing . .
          MAX follows i- out into the wasteland...
          The vehicle comes to a halt...
          Cautiously, MAX draws alongside: WEZ sits stock still,
          looking out at the desert beyond...
          It is not until MAX is alongside his face that we see
          the tip of the arrow protruding from his left eye...
          On the front of the vehicle the FERAL KID starts to
          sob...

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          179. HILLTOP. POWDER RIVER. DUSK. 179.
           MAX stands on a hilltop, overlooking Powder River.
          â¢ Below him, the convoy - led by the yellow school bus
           - moves out across the plain.
          A dust trail appears on the horizon,' racing to
          intercept the convoy.
          MAX lifts his broken binoculars: it's the GYRO CAPTAIN,
          bumping along in the twisted, wreck of the gyrocopter -
          its rotors gone, engine screaming.
          MAX shakes his head and walks back to the Lone Wolf
          machine on the top of the hill.
          Once again we hear the Old Man's voice:
          NARRATOR (v/o)
          That was the last we ever saw
          of him...

          180. INT. SCHOOL BUS. DUSK. 180.

           We see PAPPAGALLO, face set with determination, driving
           the yellow school bus.
          NARRATOR (v/o)
          As for the rest of us...
          Pappagallo led us north...
          to safety - to a place in the
          sun...
          In the tenth year, nurturing
          his vision of a new world,
          he died felling timber.
          The LUSTY GIRL rolls her eyes and sighs as the GYRO
          CAPTAIN draws alongside her window...
          NARRATOR (v/o)
          The Captain and the Girl waged
          war for years... together they
          raised eight children...

          180. Cont. 180
          The FERAL KID, sitting in the back of the bus, turrs
          to face us. His bright yellow eyes stare directly
          into camera...
          NARRATOR (v/o) '
          in the fullness of time,
          I became the leader - the
          chief of the Great Northern

          DISSOLVE.

          181. THE NARRATOR'S FACE.

          181,
           For the first time we see the Narrator's eyes - they
           are bright yellow.

                                           FIRST DRAFT

                                           September 18, 1995





FADE IN:

From the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young
woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her
mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name
is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in

A ROYAL BEDCHAMBER

The royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal
mother grips her hands...

On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated
from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are
royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to
their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain
of childbirth.

Her fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her
need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for
the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head,
stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers.

                     DOCTOR
          The head is born!  One arm... the
          other arm... it is a boy!

The advisors, disregarding the Queen's privacy, scurry around
the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet
with birth.  The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony,
yet she struggles to lift her head.

                     ADVISOR 1
          I shall tell the king!

                     ADVISOR 2
          I shall tell him!

They hurry for the door.  But their race to be first to bring
this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits
another cry; it surprises the doctor.

                     DOCTOR
          M'lady...?

He kneels again to examine the Queen.

                     DOCTOR
          Another...?  It is another!

The joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors.  They look
gravely at each other, as they hear a second BABY'S CRY.

                                                SMASH TO:

A DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT

A door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard
and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is
hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his
cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER.

He carries an OBLONG BASKET.

A carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the
courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a
sharp word to the driver --

                     MUSKETEER
          Away.

The whip CRACKS and the carriage plunges into the night.

                                           TIME DISSOLVE:

EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY

On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the
southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison,
like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and
foreboding.  As we SUPERIMPOSE:

                            1662
                   TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER

INT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON

With the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It
is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their
own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive
women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which
prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding
staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of
a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places
we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell.

And we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying,
to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his
eyes... They are blue, childlike.

A greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to
the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty.

                     KEEPER
          You dead yet?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No, Keeper.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE:

                           PARIS

EXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing
figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the
moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the
cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy
shadows.  He is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily
as if they were racing across an open field and not through a
cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace
and power came not from the animal but from the rider.
Sitting lightly in the saddle is

D'ARTAGNAN

famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.  He
is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in
his courage and his loyalty.

He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the
streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.  When they
see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.  They sail by
d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a
boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding.

OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL

D'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence
beside Notre Dame Cathedral.  Priests are dispensing food to
beggars gathered in the courtyard.  As d'Artagnan reins his
horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at
the royal symbols on his uniform.  But d'Artagnan is not a
man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and
moves toward the doorways the people part for him.

He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old
residence, a big rickety carriage.  D'Artagnan smiles.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Porthos too!

D'Artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the
staircase of the tower above him.

INT.  PRIESTS' RESIDENCE - A STAIRWAY - DAY

Four people are moving up a winding stairway; three are
women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth
is PORTHOS, the former Musketeer, now a nobleman of great
wealth and even greater girth.  He and the women are drinking
wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos
like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  Porthos is not so
drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip
their bodies as they walk and giggle.

                     PORTHOS
          Ah ha!  Here we are!  Aramis!
          Porthos is here!

They reach a doorway.  Porthos kicks it open, staggers back,
and begins shoving the women inside.

INT.  A PRIEST'S APARTMENT - DAY

The first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops
short at what she sees.  The second and third stumble in
after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they
see.  Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in.

                     PORTHOS
          Aaaaaaaramis!!  Porthos is --

He stops dead in his tracks.  From the POV OF PORTHOS AND THE
WOMEN, we see ARAMIS.  Always the most theological of the
Musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and
powerful.  And still handsome, or at least he would be; but
now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar,
wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer.

                     PORTHOS
          Sorry, my dears.  You would have
          enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a
          donkey.

                     WENCH 1
          So are you.

                     PORTHOS
          Really?  I haven't been able to see
          it for fifteen years.  Go on now,
          leave His Holiness alone.  I'll
          bring you back tomorrow when he's in
          a better mood.

He whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to
Aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend.

                     PORTHOS
          Please revel with me, Aramis, I need
          my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm
          weak, my strength is gone --

                     ARAMIS
          Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you
          see I'm praying?

                     PORTHOS
          I just said you're praying!  Are you
          deaf too?  I know you're blind,
          because if you had seen the tits
          that just walked out of here, you'd
          have tears in your eyes.

                     ARAMIS
               (trying to ignore him)
          There are more important things than
          tits.

                     PORTHOS
          Really?  If you can name me one
          thing, one single thing, that is
          more sublime than the feel of a
          plump pink nipple between my lips,
          I will buy you a new cathedral.

Aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait.

                     ARAMIS
          Forgiveness.

                     PORTHOS
          Forgiveness?

As if in reply, Porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart.

                     PORTHOS
               (beat)
          Forgive me.

Aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries
to keep praying.

                     PORTHOS
          Am I forgiven?

Aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend.  Porthos reels
backwards, landing in a chair.

                     PORTHOS
          I observe your forgiveness isn't
          sweeter than a plump nipple.

                     ARAMIS
          Can't you see I'm praying,
          goddammit?!

Porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls.
Aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; Porthos
picks up the whole table -- just as d'Artagnan enters.

                     PORTHOS AND ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan.

Porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'Artagnan.

                     PORTHOS
          How are you, you skinny little pup!

Aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment.

                     ARAMIS
          A simple theological discussion.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Aramis -- the King wishes to see
          you.

                     ARAMIS
          Still you serve him loyally --
          though people hurl rotten eggs at
          his royal emblem.

Aramis lifts d'Artagnan's cloak as evidence:  near its hem,
sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I see your mind is sharp as ever.
          The King said, "Right away."  Cut
          deep and hard, my friends.

                     PORTHOS
          Deep and hard, D'Artagnan.

D'Artagnan clasps Porthos' hand, then that of Aramis, and
leaves, as Porthos shakes his head.

                     PORTHOS
          We were all Musketeers once, eh?  Oh,
          I forgot.  For the poor, the ones
          you were praying for.

He hands a purse to Aramis.  Surprised, even touched, Aramis
reaches for it.  Just as he takes the money, Porthos throws a
haymaker; but Aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks.
Suddenly the two old warriors are circling again.

                     PORTHOS
          I wonder how Athos is doing.

INT.  A SMALL HOUSE - DAY

ATHOS stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed
in a dark plain coat, he too is a former Musketeer -- gray
haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust
of manners masking seas of emotion.  He opens a small wooden
box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's
looking for just as his son RAOUL enters.  RAOUL is in his
mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French
Army.  He is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the
mirror.

                     RAOUL
          Do I look all right?

                     ATHOS
          None of the ladies will be able to
          take their eyes off you.

                     RAOUL
          I care only about Michelle.  Should
          I ask her when we first arrive?
          Or... or when we're leaving?  I
          could ask her in the carriage -- but
          it is more romantic at the palace.
          I get so confused...

                     ATHOS
          Perhaps this will help.

He hands Raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box.

                     RAOUL
          Mother's ring.  I can't take this.

                     ATHOS
          She died giving you to me.  And I
          want to die knowing it is one the
          finger of the women my son loves.

They embrace.  Athos' eyes mist, but he smiles.

                     ATHOS
          Now go, and bring back your fiance.

ESTABLISHING - THE ROYAL PALACE - DAY

The Palace glows golden in the Parisian sunshine.  Carriages
deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens.

EXT.  THE ROYAL PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

Attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire
of Louis XIV's France, the men like peacocks, the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms.  They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the
doorway, through which the king is about to come...

JUST BEYOND THAT PALACE DOORWAY

KING LOUIS the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors.  He is twenty-two, and would be quite
handsome, except for the total self-absorption.  He's
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors, PIERRE and CLAUDE, try to speak with him.

                     PIERRE
          Your Majesty, I know it is a... a
          festive time, but before --

                     KING LOUIS
          The blue sash.  No, the burgundy!

                     PIERRE
          ... before the party begins --

                     KING LOUIS
          The party has already begun -- so
          why are you delaying me?

                     PIERRE
          We do not wish to delay you,
          Majesty, but... as your advisors, we
          feel it is our -- our --

                     CLAUDE
          ... our duty.

                     PIERRE
          Yes!  It is our duty to let you
          know... there are riots in Paris.

                     LOUIS
          Riots?  My people live in the
          world's most beautiful city, their
          king has the grandest palaces on
          earth.  Why should they feel
          anything but pride and contentment?

                     PIERRE
          Well yes, of course, Majesty, and
          I'm sure they are content... except
          that... well, they are starving.

                     LOUIS
          Sometimes the poor do grow hungry.
          But why would they riot about it?

As he says this, a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs.

                     PIERRE
          Majesty... We have more than enough
          food set aside for your birthday
          celebration next week.  If we
          distributed some of that, we would
          have time to gather more before --

                     LOUIS
          Aramis!  I have been expecting you!
               (to the tailors)
          We are satisfied, that will do.

The tailors and advisors withdraw as Aramis -- still in his
simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind.

                     ARAMIS
          Your birthday celebration, your
          Majesty?

                     LOUIS
          Next week.  This is a mere garden
          party -- and I wish to join it, so I
          will be brief.  I am experiencing
          resistance from the Jesuits.

                     ARAMIS
          Well... perhaps you should speak
          with them, your Majesty.

                     LOUIS
          I have demanded it -- and common
          priests present themselves!  Can you
          imagine the arrogance?  Common
          Jesuit priests try to act as my
          equals, and they refuse to reveal
          the names of anyone else in their
          order!  No one can keep secrets like
          the Jesuits can, and the identity of
          their leader is the darkest secret
          they hold.  Even the Pope himself
          does not know who leads the Jesuit
          Order in France!  He suspects the
          Governor General of Jesuits, whoever
          he is, is angling to become Pope
          himself.

                     ARAMIS
          How can I serve you in this?

                     LOUIS
          Perhaps you can find out who this
          secret leader of the Jesuits is.
          You are now a priest, but you were
          once a Musketeer, serving the throne
          of France, a throne ordained of God.
          Can you accept this mission, and
          keep it private?

                     ARAMIS
          If I find out the identity of this
          Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him
          and the man who told me.

                     LOUIS
          Once a Musketeer, always a
          Musketeer, eh?

Aramis bows and Louis turns back to his mirror.  There are
mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his
reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric
from the sun.  Aramis leaves and the advisors return.

                     LOUIS
          Ah yes, the riots.  We have food
          stocks on the wharves right now, no?

                     PIERRE
          That food has spoiled.  That is why
          it was not shipped to the army.

                     LOUIS
          Exactly why it should be given away.

                     PIERRE
          What... an excellent idea, your
          Majesty!

EXT.  PALACE GARDENS - DAY

Among the guests are Raoul and MICHELLE, a stunningly
beautiful young woman.  Michelle is awed by the richness all
around them, while Raoul sees only her.  He holds the ring.

                     MICHELLE
          Isn't it glorious!

                     RAOUL
          Michelle...

But just as he starts to speak, trumpets blast and the King
steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens; the
party goers give him a rousing ovation.  Raoul returns the
ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment.

Everyone watches the King, who begins guzzling wine and
telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the King's
witticisms.  Then Louis catches sight of Raoul and Michelle,
and lowers his voice, to his FRIENDS...

                     LOUIS
          Who is that?

                     FRIEND 1
          Raoul, son of Athos.

                     LOUIS
          Not the soldier, you idiot!

                     FRIEND 2
          Her name is Michelle.

The king is transfixed.

D'ARTAGNAN

is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young Musketeers,
directing them to their positions around the gardens, like
secret service agents protecting a president.  He leaves
them, and quickly moves to the King.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty...

                     LOUIS
          What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins
          falling from the sky now?

The sycophants laugh loudly.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The plans for use of the maze were
          not disclosed to me.

                     LOUIS
          I decided it this morning.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Then you must allow me to stay close
          to you so that --

                     LOUIS
          I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will
          change my mind as I wish, and I will
          enjoy my banquet as I wish!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          But I deployed the Royal Guards
          according to your previous --

                     LOUIS
          Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let
          us pretend I am King and you are
          Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us
          behave as if my wish is law.  And my
          wish is to enjoy this party!

D'Artagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle.
D'Artagnan retreats, then looks back to Louis and follows his
gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye.
D'Artagnan recognizes Raoul, son of his friend Athos.

RAOUL AND MICHELLE

As the guests mix and mingle, Raoul tries again.

                     RAOUL
          Michelle, I... Ever since I returned
          I've been wanting to speak with you
          about... about --

A gaunt SERVANT interrupts, presenting a tray of delicacies.

                     SERVANT
          Monsieur, Mademoiselle...?

                     RAOUL
          No!  Thank you -- Michelle, I --

They are interrupted by the SQUEAL of a piglet, squirming in
the hands of the king's dwarf, who holds the fat little
animal above his head and runs among the startled guests.

                     LOUIS
          It pleases us to announce an
          entertainment for our guests!  A
          contest of agility and cunning!

He takes the pig from his dwarf; the pig is clean and
perfumed, a colorful fake horn tied onto its head.

                     LOUIS
          Behold our unicorn!  Whichever of
          our guests captures the unicorn
          shall win its treasure!

With this announcement the King produces a diamond the size
of a pecan, suspended from a ribbon; the guests gasp at its
richness.  The King ties the diamond around the pig's neck.

RAOUL AND MICHELLE

Michelle is amazed at this.

                     MICHELLE
          I have never seen a diamond so
          large!

It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in
his hand.

                     LOUIS
          Into the maze!  All of you!
          Disperse, I command you!

The dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break
in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding
the first laughing lunges of the guests.

THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle
of confusion.  LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of
the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.  From his perch he
looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement.

                     LOUIS
          Are you men or mice?!

MICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for
it.  He almost has the pig... then it kicks free.

                     RAOUL
          The pendant will be yours!

With that he races after the pig.

MICHELLE tries to follow, this way, that way, through the
maze.  Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering
through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners.

                     LOUIS
          Michelle, isn't it?

Speechless, she nods.

                     LOUIS
          I would have said it was impossible,
          but I believe the excitement of the
          chase has made you even more
          beautiful.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire, I --

                     LOUIS
          You blush!  You do not wish to be
          beautiful to your King?

Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening.

FROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis
tries to seduce the young woman.  Even as d'Artagnan watches,
the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement
d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the
sureness of the farm boy he once was.  The pig is quiet and
comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands.

D'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she
allows him to touch her cheek.  The king leans to kiss her...
Michelle does not move...

WHHEEEKKKK!  The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground
running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing.

The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the
pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away.

                     LOUIS
          Wait!  Michelle, I --

Too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him,
leaping down onto him from the observation platform.  It is
the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he
has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is
diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat.

The king is helpless, frozen.  The assassin leaps, falling
toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan,
springing through the gate to save his king.

Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops,
mortally wounded.  They stare down at him now; the would-be
assassin gurgles words through his agony...

                     ASSASSIN
          Feed... your... people.

Party guests, having heard Michelle scream, are running in to
find them.  Michelle rushes off, to find Raoul; several
people are coming up.

                     ASSASSIN
          Your people starve...!  Feed --

The king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the
throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words.  The
king looks at his stunned subjects.

                     LOUIS
          A pitiful madman, nothing more.
          Come, let us continue our chase!
          Where is our unicorn?

The King prances away.  It takes the guests a moment, but
they know that only gaiety will please their King, and off
they go again, laughing as if nothing happened.

D'Artagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his
command come rushing up with swords drawn.

                     YOUNG MUSKETEER
          Captain!

Seeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration.

                     YOUNG MUSKETEER
          You are the best --

D'Artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the King
he turns quickly and walks away.

INT.  FORTRESS PRISON

The Man in the Iron Mask sits on the floor.  A key rattles in
the lock and his keeper shuffles in, carrying food.

                     KEEPER
          Food, moron.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Thank you, Keeper.

Not watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on
something and stumbles, dropping the food.  The prisoner
jumps to his feet, concerned.

                     KEEPER
          Look what you've done!

He picks up the tray and slings it at the prisoner.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I'm sorry, Keeper...

The keeper looks for what he tripped on -- a worn Bible.  He
snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No, Keeper, it's my only book!

Hearing the pleading in the prisoner's voice, the keeper
looks squarely at him -- and rips out the pages.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What number did you tear out?

                     KEEPER
          Eh?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What number, on the first page?

                     KEEPER
          ... Two-thirty-seven.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the
          descendants of Japeth are these:
          Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."

As the prisoner rattles off the names of Biblical genealogy,
the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand.

                     KEEPER
          You've... memorized...?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What was the end page?

As the keeper is speechless, the prisoner looks for himself.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Six-two-one:  "... Though I speak
          with the tongues of men and angels,
          and have not love, I am but a
          clanging cymbal or --"

The Keeper staggers in shock; the prisoner bubbles with joy.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          We're playing, Keeper!  A game!
          Take another page, any page!  Keeper
          and I are playing a game!

And the prisoner takes the keeper's fat hands in his own and
begins to dance and sing.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          A game, a game, we're playing a --

The keeper's left arm goes rigid, and he clutches his chest
with his right hand; he drops upon the stone floor.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Keeper...?

The prisoner approaches the jailer; the man is stoned dead.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No... No!  Keeper, please, you
          cannot die!  You're my only friend!

The prisoner tries to wipe his eyes, but he can't get at
them, inside the mask.  He edges to the open door.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Help!  Someone!  Keeper is dead!

He slumps down beside the open door, and weeps.

INT.  PALACE - D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - EVENING

D'Artagnan's room is spartan:  a cot, and weapons laid on a
plain table.  It has a single small window, and d'Artagnan
stands at it now, looking out into the Palace garden below.

The guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been
cleared away.  And now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady
walks.  She is Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, the lady we
saw in the opening.

Now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure.  Her
clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she
walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants.

She glances up, and sees d'Artagnan's form in the window.
When he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window.

INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - EVENING

D'Artagnan's room is along the same corridor as the Royal
Apartments.  D'Artagnan sits at the small table, going over
paperwork.  Through his open door he sees that Anne and her
attendants are filing along in the corridor, and he rivets
his eyes back to his work.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Anne reaches the door to her apartment, and looks back to
where d'Artagnan's door is open.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM

The Queen Mother's ATTENDANT appears at d'Artagnan's door.

                     ATTENDANT
          She wishes a word with you.

INT.  THE CORRIDOR

D'Artagnan approaches the Queen Mother, and bows.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          M'lady...?

                     ANNE
          I understand you saved my son's life
          today.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          God smiled upon us.

                     ANNE
          And you were not hurt?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No, M'lady.

                     ANNE
          That is good.

Without a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad
face, she enters her room.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - EVENING

D'Artagnan returns to his room, just as a young LIEUTENANT of
Musketeers (Andre) arrives with two of the Royal Guards.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Duty lists of the day, Captain!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Thank you, Andre.

They hand him the list and salute again, to leave.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Wait.  There is an entry here --
          "Messenger sent by King to residence
          of Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort."
          Why was that?

The young Musketeers try not to smirk.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Well, Captain...

INT.  ATHOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Athos sits alone, playing a haunting melody on a violin.  It
is a sad tune, played with feeling; he stops as he hears a
KNOCK at his door, and opens it to --

                     ATHOS
          D'Artagnan!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos, my friend!

They embrace with deep affection -- friends who have shared
each other's darkest times.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It's been too long.

                     ATHOS
          Life is too long.  Except when we
          have our friends.  Look at you!
          You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll
          open a bottle of wine.

D'Artagnan takes one of the wooden chairs, by the meager
fire.  The whole place is modest at best.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Thanks, but not for me.

                     ATHOS
          You can't drink with a friend you
          haven't seen in months?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I have ordered a drill of the Royal
          Guard for midnight, and must be
          clear-headed for it.

                     ATHOS
          Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the
          youngsters hard, eh?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          They must stay sharp.  There was an
          attempt on the King's life today.

                     ATHOS
          Another?  How many times have you
          saved his life in this year alone?
          Three?  Four?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I heard your playing.

                     ATHOS
          I was feeling sorry for myself.
          Raoul is getting married, he
          proposed today!  I love that boy
          beyond all measure, I've spent
          everything I own to give him
          education and opportunity.  Now he
          has complete happiness, and I mope.

A cloud passes d'Artagnan's face; he has something to tell
Athos.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos...

But whatever it is that d'Artagnan wants to say is
interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs.  As
Athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'Artagnan, now it
glows as he jumps up to welcome his son.

                     ATHOS
          That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look,
          d'Artagnan's come to visit...!
          What's wrong?  You look awful!

                     RAOUL
          Michelle, she -- The king has
          invited her to come live in the
          palace.

Athos is stunned; d'Artagnan witnesses this with agony.

                     ATHOS
          But -- are you sure?

                     RAOUL
          We were at her door.  I was just
          taking the ring from my pocket, for
          the third time today, when a young
          Musketeer brought the invitation for
          her to become a lady-in-waiting for
          the Queen Mother.

                     ATHOS
          Michelle cannot possibly accept!

                     RAOUL
          She cannot possibly refuse.  Her
          family is poor, they have even less
          money than we do.  And along with
          the invitation, the King sent the
          diamond pendant, from the piglet.

                     ATHOS
          Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?

                     RAOUL
          Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter
          now.  She loved me once.  I want to
          die remembering that.

                     ATHOS
          Die?  What...?

                     RAOUL
          I have rejoined the army, and asked
          to resume my commission at the head
          of the troops of General Fromberge.

                     ATHOS
          Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.

                     RAOUL
          It is already done.  I have just
          stopped at Mother's grave, to say
          goodbye, before coming to tell you.

                     ATHOS
          Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No
          matter how your heart is broken --

But Raoul stops him, with an embrace.

                     RAOUL
          Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.

                     ATHOS
          Raoul --

Raoul breaks away, and runs from the room.  Athos, so joyful
moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt.

                     ATHOS
          This cannot be.  Everyone knows the
          Queen Mother is a recluse, and the
          ladies-in-waiting are but
          mistresses for the king!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          If the young woman truly loves
          Raoul --

                     ATHOS
          She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a
          poor family.  You may still be young
          enough to believe love conquers
          everything, but I am old and hard
          and I've seen too much.  Even when
          kings are hunchbacks they have any
          woman they desire, because power
          seduces even more than love!

D'Artagnan is silent, and even ashamed.  Athos realizes --

                     ATHOS
          You knew this was happening.  You
          knew and that's why you came.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I fear I know our King.  I came to
          try to bring you hope.

                     ATHOS
          What hope is there?  A wartime
          commission cannot be vacated except
          by the king, and what chance is
          there of that?  Fromberge is on the
          battle line, and Raoul --

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I have dispatches a message to
          Fromberge requesting that Raoul be
          kept far from the fighting.

                     ATHOS
          Raoul is everything to me.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I know.

                     ATHOS
          Oh my friend.

Athos grips d'Artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I will also speak with the King, for
          he is surely unaware of the problems
          his invitation to Mademoiselle
          Beaufort has caused.

                     ATHOS
          You trust his character more than
          anyone else does.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I
          must hurry too.

                     ATHOS
          Save my son, d'Artagnan.

They embrace once more, and d'Artagnan leaves.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - DAY

Magnificent public buildings -- palaces and cathedrals --
grace the city's skyline, but here in central Paris all is
squalor.  On a narrow, filthy street, beggars bother the
sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves.

But interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon,
and one of them, Lieutenant Andre, announces --

                     LIEUTENANT
          Here is food, the gift of your
          loving King, on his birthday!  He
          gives to himself by giving to you,
          in that he loves you so much!

Slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward.  As
the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs -- bread, cabbages,
tomatoes, eggs -- those nearest the wagon begin to jostle
each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly.

                     LIEUTENANT
          No need to fight, there is plenty
          for all!

It's looking like a holiday celebration... until a RUFFIAN
breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose.

                     RUFFIAN
          This stuff stinks.  It is rotting!
          The King gives us rotten food!

He hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers.  Other paupers
sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger:
they throw food at the soldiers... Then a paving stone
crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with
the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the
streets in the direction of the palace.

D'ARTAGNAN, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner
and sees the mob coming.  And they see him:  the elegant,
dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion.

And at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side
street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction.
D'Artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second
pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic.

                     PANICKED SOLDIER
          Back, toward the palace!  We cannot
          hold them off!  We will fire a
          volley into them!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No!  Run to the palace and close the
          gates.  But do not fire!

The two new soldiers race away; d'Artagnan waits calmly on
his horse, as the mobs from both directions converge on him.

THE MOB, seeing the dashing Musketeer wait so confidently for
them, slow up; but the ruffian urges them on.

                     RUFFIAN
          Come on!  To the palace!

D'Artagnan sits calmly in their way.  He doesn't even draw
his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his
horse.  Some of the mob recognize him, and murmur...

                     MOB
          It's d'Artagnan!  Le Generale de
          Musketeers!

The mob hesitates -- for the name d'Artagnan means heroism
and patriotism to all of them.

                     RUFFIAN
          One Musketeer can't stop us!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Stop you?  You are Frenchmen, are
          you not?  I am one of you.

                     RUFFIAN
          The King is a Frenchman, but he is
          not one of us!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Citizens of Paris!  Give ear to me!

                     RUFFIAN
          We'll give you their ears!

With that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it
to the ear of the young Lieutenant who is already bloody from
being dragged through the street.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Wait -- and listen!  I beg you!

                     RIOTER
          They give us garbage, not fit for
          rats!  They think we are garbage!

With that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at
d'Artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement,
he cuts the vegetable from the air.

The display of expertise is startling.  Someone else throws a
head of lettuce; d'Artagnan slices it in half, and as the
pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I'm on my way to a salad!  Doesn't
          anybody have any endive?

The mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of
swordsmanship that lies behind it.  Someone tosses more
lettuce, and d'Artagnan divides and skewers this one as well.
This time the crowd applauds.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          A tomato?

Can he do it?  Someone fires a tomato right at his head, and
sure enough d'Artagnan spears it.  Then, with a victorious
flourish, he takes a bite of it.  His face contorts with the
taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          You are right.  It is rotten.  I
          will speak to the King myself.  You
          have my word.

The mob is completely won over by d'Artagnan; the ruffian,
angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over
the soldiers, but now the point of d'Artagnan's sword flicks
to the ruffian's neck.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          And you will release those men --
          for they serve France... and you.

                     RIOTERS
          Three cheers for d'Artagnan!
          Hurrah...!!  Hurrah...!!

The soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart
now stand and look at d'Artagnan in gratitude and awe.  The
mob has forgotten them; they see only d'Artagnan as he rakes
his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse
around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back
toward the palace.

INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

D'Artagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal
apartments.  As he reaches the door to the king's rooms, he
finds a knot of royal advisors -- among them Pierre and
Claude -- gathered outside the king's door.

                     CLAUDE
          We already know about the riots!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Does he know?

                     PIERRE
          We will tell him, when it is...

                     CLAUDE
          Convenient.

Blocked by the advisors, d'Artagnan leaves them, turning down
one hallway, and then another; he reaches the Hall of Mirrors
and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner; the
mirror becomes a door, revealing a secret passage within the
walls.  D'Artagnan steps through and the portal closes again,
leaving no trace of its existence.

INT.  PALACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Within a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen
foot ceiling, the king is making love; the YOUNG WOMAN lying
beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere.

                     YOUNG WOMAN
          Oh yes!  So good!  Ooo, wonderful,
          Marvelous!  Fan-tas --

Louis climaxes with a grunt.  She tries to sound pleased.

                     YOUNG WOMAN
          Oh, Louis, that was incredible.  It
          was better than ever before.  It --

                     LOUIS
          I'm hungry.

He hops up, throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold.

                     YOUNG WOMAN
          I will have food brought.

                     LOUIS
          I like to eat alone.

He moves to what appears to be a wardrobe, standing against
the far wall, and opens its door, revealing a secret
staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace.

                     LOUIS
          By the way, you'll be moving
          tomorrow.

Leaving the girl without another word, he moves down the
concealed stairs.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

Louis reaches the bottom of the stairs, disguised behind a
similar wardrobe in his own bedroom.  He steps out -- and is
startled as the lifesize portrait of Louis XIII on the other
side of the room opens to admit d'Artagnan.

                     LOUIS
          Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages
          were constructed for the King's
          security, not so you could step from
          my father's portrait and startle me
          to death!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It is for your security that I have
          come, your Majesty -- for the
          security of your honor.

                     LOUIS
          I already know about the riots,
          d'Artagnan, I heard them out there
          whispering.  Some fool gave the
          order to distribute rotten food.  I
          will deal with it tomorrow.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Then there is one more thing, of an
          even more personal nature.

                     LOUIS
          A personal nature?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She
          is betrothed to Raoul, the son of
          Athos the Musketeer, who has served
          France through many tribulations.

The King begins to eat from the food laid out on the table.

                     LOUIS
          Betrothed?  I think not.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          In his mind, anyway, and soon enough
          in hers.  She had written him many
          letters of love.

The King pokes at his food.

                     LOUIS
          Miss Beaufort has accepted our
          invitation.  By this we can only
          suppose that she wishes to come --
          as we wish her to be here.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty has had many women --

                     LOUIS
          That is my desire, and my desire is
          what should concern you, not the
          sentiments of some commoner!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It is not Raoul's heart alone that
          concerns me.  It is yours.  I know
          you find women compliant --
          especially the poorer ones like
          Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do
          you love them?  What about a queen
          to love?  A son of your own?

                     LOUIS
          What quaint notions, d'Artagnan!
          But they contradict my father, who
          picked his queen when he was old,
          and only then to bear me.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          There is more to love than he knew,
          or that you know.

                     LOUIS
          You dare criticize my father?!  Or
          lecture me?!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love
          your people, and you will not bear
          to see them hungry.  Love women, and
          they will love you.  Love yourself,
          and --

                     LOUIS
          That is enough!  You are a good
          servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget
          your place!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          At least help Raoul.

                     LOUIS
          Silence!  I order you!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Order Fromberge to keep him in
          safety!  It is the least you can do,
          to protect your own honor!

                     LOUIS
          I will consider it.  Now leave me.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Thank you, your Majesty.

D'Artagnan bows, steps to the lifesize portrait of Louis
XIII, touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the
secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE ON PIERRE'S FACE...

He is sweating, exceptionally pale, as he tries to project
his voice past a huge lump in his throat...

                     PIERRE
          ... And I only say that... the
          rotten food was... all my fault...
          and I take... full responsibility...
          and beg the forgiveness of you all.

He steps back, having accomplished something terrifically
difficult, and glances toward

THE KING

who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand, whispering
quietly...

                     LOUIS
          Well done, Pierre.  It will be good
          for your soul, that you have taken
          responsibility for your errors.  And
          don't worry, I will look after your
          family.

Pierre can only nod... He takes two steps, kneels, crosses
himself, and places his head between two upright rails of

THE GUILLOTINE

The King, Pierre, and other attendants are standing on a
platform before a crowd of Parisians.  The blade drops,
Pierre's head hits the basket, the crowd cheers.

The King raises his hands to quiet the crowd.

                     LOUIS
          Do not rejoice -- but know that your
          King does not tolerate blunders that
          hurt his beloved people.  More food
          is on its way, and my advisors tell
          me the new harvests are sure to be
          bountiful!

He shoots a glance at his advisors, and they are pale from
the display they've just witnessed.

                     LOUIS
          And I have new joys to announce to
          you!  Today we decree a fresh glory
          for Paris, and for all of France!
          The laying of the foundations to
          expand Versailles, and make it truly
          a palace of the sun!

The advisors all applaud furiously, but from the crowd there
is almost no reaction at all; the triple ranks of soldiers
surrounding the square discourage any protest, and as the
King leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away.

NEAR THE PLATFORM

Aramis, watching the crowd disperse, hears behind him --

                     VOICE
          Aramis.

Aramis turns to see the King, who moves up alone.

                     ARAMIS
          Your Majesty...

                     LOUIS
          How goes that favor I asked of you?

                     ARAMIS
          I grow closer to my target, your
          Majesty.

                     LOUIS
          You bring me the heart of the Jesuit
          General, and you will have a palace
          of your own.

The King moves away, followed by his fawning advisors.

INT.  THE FAVORITE MISTRESS' PALACE ROOMS - DAY

A young Musketeer ushers Michelle into the palace bedroom
previously occupied by the King's last mistress.  The
Musketeer leaves her alone, frozen in the center of the room,
awed by the opulence.  Her eyes play over the details:

-- The handcarved, richly upholstered furniture, beneath her
   fingertips...

-- The carved figures of cherubic angels, gleaming with gold,
   upon the posts of the bed...

-- The murals on the walls and ceiling...

Her reverie is interrupted by a HANDMAIDEN who bustles in
carrying a magnificent dress.

                     HANDMAIDEN
          After your bath put on this, it is
          the King's favorite color.  That
          letter on the desk came here for you
          this morning.

She tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone.  Left alone,
Michelle lifts the letter, and recognizes the writing.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul!

She opens the letter and reads quickly.

                     MICHELLE
          The army!  Oh Raoul, don't despair!
          I will always be faithful...

She interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous
dress.  She looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment,
and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed.

They depict naked gods and goddesses, in Olympian orgies.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE - STEAMING WATER, POURED INTO A TUB

The Handmaiden has prepared a 17th Century bathtub for
Michelle, and now retires.

                     HANDMAIDEN
          If you need me further, just ring.

As the handmaiden leaves, exiting frame, we PUSH IN on one of
the murals on the wall.  The eye of one of the figures there
is no longer the painted eye it was before, but is a real
human eye, disguised by the mural...

THE KING, IN THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY

is spying on Michelle.

THE KING'S POV

as Michelle undresses and steps into the bath.  Louis catches
tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy
water, and it stokes his desire.

INT.  PALACE - MICHELLE'S NEW ROOM - DAY

Michelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself,
breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress.  She stares for a
long time, surprised at her own beauty.

She reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it
around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance.  She
looks into the mirror, at her eyes... In guilt for what she
is already feeling, she lifts Raoul's letter to read it
again.  Then she gasps -- the King stands right before her.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire!  I -- How did you --

                     LOUIS
          How did I get in?  You're new here,
          and will soon learn many secrets.
          What is that?

                     MICHELLE
          ... Nothing.

                     LOUIS
          A letter.  May I see?

He takes the letter; she has no resistance against him.  The
King reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles.

                     LOUIS
          From Raoul.  He urges you to guard
          your honor -- as if it could be in
          any danger... from your king.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul... is in love...

                     LOUIS
          Enough of this, our dinner waits.

Tossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm.  She takes
it and allows him to escort her from the room.

INT.  PALACE - THE HALL OF MIRRORS

The hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames
surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections.
Musicians line the length of the hall, and when Louis and
Michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the
couple as they parade past.  Michelle is speechless, as Louis
smiles at her awed innocence.

INT.  ROYAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Louis leads Michelle into a towering room surrounding a
magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous
delicacies -- set for just two.

THE DINNER

Louis and Michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a
dozen servants.  Michelle stares at her plate.

                     LOUIS
          The food doesn't please you?

                     MICHELLE
          It's lovely.  It's just...

                     LOUIS
          This is more than you are used to.
          Your mother is a seamstress, your
          father is dead.  You have three
          younger sisters, two of whom suffer
          from consumption.  Don't look so
          surprised, Kings know such things.

                     MICHELLE
          I... we are humble people...

                     LOUIS
          Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The
          straits of your family need not be
          permanent.  It is a simple matter to
          have them brought to one of my
          country estates, where they may have
          fine meals, and physicians to look
          after them.

                     MICHELLE
          You would do that, your Majesty?

                     LOUIS
          My dear, I've already done it.

She rushes to him and throws herself at his knees, weeping in
gratitude.  Louis smiles, as if embarrassed.

                     LOUIS
          Please, darling, that isn't
          necessary.  We are friends now.
          Mademoiselle needs wine!

A servant quickly approaches with wine; the goblet at
Michelle's place is quite large, and he pours it full.

INT.  MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Louis leads Michelle back to her room; she's a bit unsteady
from the wine; but she grows alert as she notices him closing
the door behind her.  He stares into her eyes.

                     LOUIS
          You are beautiful.  You know you
          are.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire, I --

                     LOUIS
          If you don't want to be so
          appealing, why did you touch the
          rose to your skin?  Where was it?
          Here?

He touches his lips to her throat.  She gasps, but then pulls
away.  She glances at the letter on the writing table.

                     LOUIS
          What is it?  Raoul?  If he really
          loved you, he would have proposed
          marriage.  He didn't, did he?

He sees her hesitation and uncertainty.  He's smooth, gentle.

                     LOUIS
          You have never known love until you
          have known the love of a king.

He kisses her; for a moment she seems frozen... and then she
yields.  Never having doubted that she would.  Louis pulls
the gown from her shoulders.  She doesn't resist.

INT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON

The old Jailer, carrying a torch that barely pushes back the
darkness, leads another guard up the winding stairs.

                     JAILER
          It's a jolt at first, so brace
          yourself.

INT.  CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK

The Man in the Iron Mask lifts his head as a key rattles into
his door.  The door opens, admitting his old Jailer, and a
NEW KEEPER.  The New Keeper is just a younger version of the
old one -- greasy, fat, and cruel.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Ugh!  He looks 'orrible.

The Man in the Iron Mask rises and takes a step forward; the
new keeper recoils and raises his club threateningly.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Stay back!

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I frighten you.  It's okay.  Keeper
          was scared of me too, at first.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Scared?

The New Keeper steps forward and clubs the Man in the Iron
Mask in the shoulder, then kicks him as he falls.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Scared of you?  Not me.  I'll kill
          him if he gets near me.

The New Keeper strides out.  The Man in the Iron Mask pulls
himself to his knees; his eyes, visible through the slits of
the mask, look sadly at the old Jailer.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I miss Keeper.  I miss him so much.

                     JAILER
          Moron.

The jailer leaves the cell, locking the door behind him.

INT.  A BATTLEFIELD COMMAND TENT

Raoul has just received orders from General Fromberge, who
sits at a map table, Raoul salutes and follows a young staff
officer from the tent.  As Raoul leaves, the General
withdraws from his leather field pouch a royal letter --
parchment, with blue and gold seals.  Fromberge touches the
edge of the parchment to the candle, and burns the letter...

EXT.  TRENCH - DARKNESS

Two men move along a deep trench, the siege works of 17th
century siege warfare.  One of the men is Raoul, carrying a
musket; in his new uniform he looks out of place among the
dirty, battle weary men they pass.  He is following the STAFF
OFFICER who is no older than himself, but whose eyes are
already dead, while Raoul's are wide and wild.

The trench is deep as a grave; by crouching, both men keep
their heads below the surrounding ground.  Thick smoke rolls
over their heads; we can't tell if it is day or night.  From
all around come sounds of battle, with the sporadic fire of
muskets and the rumble of cannons; officers shout orders in
the distance; wounded men nearby whimper for water and the
officer leads Raoul by them as if they did not exist.

The young Staff Officer stops at a bend in the trench.

                     STAFF OFFICER
          Here.

Without another word he goes back the way he came.  Raoul
grips his musket and looks around him; he finds himself among
several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the
trench.  He has little time to wonder what will happen next.
A horn trumpets close by, and with a shout, the French
soldiers clamber out of their breastworks.

For an instant, Raoul hesitates in pure terror, then joins
the charge with a shout of his own --

                     RAOUL
          Mi-cheeelllll!! --

On the stone wall looming above the French soldiers, orange
blossoms of fire -- the muzzle flash of primitive cannons --
penetrate the smoke, and the ground at Raoul's feet explodes,
hurling him backwards.  He covered barely a few feet, and
falls almost exactly where he started.

Dead.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE - THE DOOR OF ATHOS' ROOMS - DAY

A gloved hand raps on the door.  Athos opens it to a military
messenger, who shoves at him a single sheet of paper, rolled
and tied with ribbon.

INT.  ATHOS' ROOM - NIGHT

The message slams onto the table as Athos staggers upon it,
his legs buckling beneath him in shock and grief.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - DAY

D'Artagnan is working at his desk, as the Lieutenant enters.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Sir... a casualty report came...

D'Artagnan looks at the paper the Lieutenant hands him.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No, no, no...

He sags for a moment, then grabs his cloak and sword.

INT./ EXT.  MUSKETEER'S GATE OF THE PALACE - DAY

The Musketeer's Gate is close to the stables where the
Musketeers train and keep their horses.  D'Artagnan hurries
from the Palace and snaps an order.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Saddle my horse!

The grooms jump to work; several young Musketeers nearby stop
their training, noticing their Captain's agitation.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Hurry --

But then d'Artagnan sees Athos coming, riding furiously
through the Musketeers' gate.  D'Artagnan steps out to meet
him as Athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos, my friend --

Athos marches to the palace door; d'Artagnan cuts him off.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos, please...!

                     ATHOS
          Get out of my way.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
               (grabbing him)
          Athos, I beg you --

Athos punches d'Artagnan with furious strength, knocking him
aside.  The young Musketeers reach for their weapons, but
d'Artagnan is up quickly, throwing himself in front of Athos
again, blocking the doorway into the palace.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Where are you going?

                     ATHOS
          To kill the king.

At this, the swords of the young Musketeers sing from their
scabbards.  Athos wears a sword, but he has not drawn it.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos!  I know life means nothing to
          you at this moment, but I will not
          let you kill yourself.

                     ATHOS
          The King killed my son!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The cannons killed Raoul!  The
          cannons, and love.  But not the King.

A YOUNG MUSKETEER steps up.

                     YOUNG MUSKETEER
          I'll kill the old man for you,
          Captain, if you don't wish to --

Athos spins, striking like a rattlesnake, his sword whipping
from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young
Musketeer's ear.  He flicks another's sword from his grasp,
then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the
chin of a third, shoving him back.

                     ATHOS
          Come on!  All of you!

D'Artagnan tackles Athos from behind and pins him face down
to the hay.  For a moment Athos bellows in rage --

                     ATHOS
          Coward!  Fight me!  Fight me...!

Emotion spills up into Athos' throat, and he begins to sob.

                     ATHOS
          He killed my son, d'Artagnan!  He
          killed my son...!

D'Artagnan, dying inside, still grips Athos.  Athos grows
quiet, and the young Musketeers drift closer.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Get back, all of you!

D'Artagnan stands, and Athos rises, still holding his sword.
He looks at d'Artagnan a long beat, then sheathes his sword
and turns to his horse.  The young soldiers move to him.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Let him go!

Athos mounts his horse, and with a last glance back at
d'Artagnan, he gallops away.

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

The King has just climaxed in his lovemaking, and lies spent
upon Michelle.  His rest is interrupted by a KNOCK at his
door.  The King scowls.

                     LOUIS
          What?!

                     VOICE
          Your Majesty... it is Andre.

Louis groans, and pulls on a robe.  Michelle whispers --

                     MICHELLE
          Shall I leave?

                     LOUIS
          No, you may wait behind the screen.

Michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as
Louis goes to the door and admits the young Lieutenant.

BEHIND THE SCREEN, Michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and
appraises her face; she begins brushing her long hair.  She
can hear the conversation...

                     LIEUTENANT
          I would not have disturbed you,
          Majesty, but you ordered me to keep
          you informed --

                     LOUIS
          Yes, yes, go on.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Athos, the former Musketeer, has
          just fought with several of your
          guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.

Behind the screen, Michelle pauses at the mention of Athos.

                     LOUIS
          Did they kill him?

                     LIEUTENANT
          No.  He cut an ear from one of the
          men, no one else was hurt.  Captain
          d'Artagnan allowed him to leave.
          Athos was upset about the death of
          his son, at the front.

CRASH!  From behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror,
shattering as it drops to the floor.  It startles the
Lieutenant, but the King goes on...

                     LOUIS
          Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me!
          Did he try to enter the palace?

                     LIEUTENANT
          ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan
          blocked his way.

                     LOUIS
          You may go, Lieutenant.

The Lieutenant moves back to the door.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Do you want Athos arrested, your
          Majesty?

                     LOUIS
          Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan
          to do it.

The Lieutenant leaves, and Louis moves behind the screen to
see Michelle stagger and grip the dressing table; her bare
feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror, yet she is
oblivious to the cuts.  Louis sees this and grabs her.

                     LOUIS
          My dear!  The glass -- !

He pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her,
cuddling her as she begins to shake.

                     MICHELLE
          Did you know... about Raoul?

                     LOUIS
          I did not want to upset you.  It was
          tragic.  I did everything I could
          for him.  I ordered him positioned
          in a spot of complete safety, far
          from the fighting.  But he
          disregarded my wishes and charged
          into danger.

He cuddles her as she weeps.

                     LOUIS
          I will order a Mass for his soul.
          It will guarantee his place in
          Heaven.

                     MICHELLE
          Oh Louis, Louis...

She clings to him in her grief.

EXT.  NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY

The great cathedral rises next to the monastery where Aramis
resides.  We PAN DOWN and PUSH IN on the cobblestones between
the two structures, as if penetrating to --

SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES

Aramis leads Porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis... is this the way to hell?

                     ARAMIS
          Hell may be our destination, dear
          Porthos, but not this trip.

They reach an iron door and move through it, into

A GORGEOUS, SECRET CHAPEL

Candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes.  The place is
breathtaking.

                     PORTHOS
          Where are we?

                     ARAMIS
          Jesus of Nazareth found the holy
          among the profane.  If we are to
          have a place of private prayer,
          where better than here, beside the
          channels where the shit and the
          garbage run to the river?

Porthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and
sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass.

                     PORTHOS
          Mother of God!

                     ARAMIS
          It is also a place of burial.

                     PORTHOS
          A tomb?  We're in a tomb?

                     ARAMIS
          Catacombs.  Very holy.

Porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment
-- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens.

                     PORTHOS
          Yaaaahhh!

A hooded figure, looking like the Grim Reaper, enters.

                     ARAMIS
          Relax, you big fool, it's
          d'Artagnan.

And sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been
led in by a little monk, is d'Artagnan.  Aramis nods to the
monk, who leaves quickly.  Before d'Artagnan can ask
anything, Porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and
monks usher in Athos, who freezes as he sees d'Artagnan.

                     ARAMIS
          It's all right.  D'Artagnan was the
          one who warned us that he'd been
          given an order for your arrest.
          Here you have sanctuary -- does he
          not, d'Artagnan?

The escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that
the four Musketeers are left to sit at a small table the
monks have set up, Athos and D'Artagnan opposite each other.

                     ARAMIS
          Look at us.  We are old men now.  But
          once we were young.  And when we saw
          injustice, we fought it.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          We have grown wiser with age.  Now
          we know that some problems cannot be
          settled with a sword.

                     ATHOS
          And some problems cannot be settled
          without one.

                     ARAMIS
          Well here is the problem at hand:
          the King has ordered me to discover
          the identity of the Governor General
          of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our
          English rivals have left the
          Catholic Church, Louis has struck on
          a plan to dominate the whole of
          Europe by uniting Church and State
          and making himself head of both.  He
          has already picked the Pope.  Only
          the Jesuits, who put God above
          throne or papacy, stand in his way.

                     PORTHOS
          But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope
          and King?

                     ARAMIS
          So they tell us.  But what are we to
          believe when the king is a tyrant,
          and the Church, meant to stand for
          all those oppressed, has become the
          tool of oppression?  When no
          conscience is tolerated?  No
          dissent, no objection?

                     PORTHOS
          It is a weighty problem, Aramis --
          but perhaps you should leave it to
          this secret General of the Jesuits,
          whoever he might be.

                     ARAMIS
          Easy to say, but hard to do.  For
          what I am trying to tell you is that
          I am the Governor General of Jesuits
          in France.

A stunned silence.

                     ATHOS
          What do you propose to do?

                     ARAMIS
          Replace the king.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I cannot hear this!

                     PORTHOS
          It can't be done.

                     ARAMIS
          It can.  I know the way.

                     ATHOS
          I am with you!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No!  Stop --

                     ARAMIS
          I will need you all.  All for one.
          One for all.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
               (jumping up)
          You -- You cannot ask me to betray
          my king!  I have sworn to him!

                     ATHOS
          It is honor you serve, and when the
          king is dishonorable you are removed
          from your oath of honor!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          An oath is an oath precisely because
          it cannot be removed!

                     ATHOS
          Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?!
          I know you have put service above
          your own life, but why does this
          King deserve such loyalty?  He is a
          monster!  He executes ministers for
          his own blunders, with their
          families hostage so they take the
          blame!  He has no honor!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No man is all bad... or all good.  I
          believe -- I must believe -- that
          Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can
          help him.

Athos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'Artagnan.

                     ATHOS
          Whatever the plan... I am in it!
          The next time we meet, one of us
          will die.

He storms out of the rear door of the chapel.

                     ARAMIS
          Porthos, see to Athos, won't you?

Porthos follows Athos; Aramis and d'Artagnan are left alone.

                     ARAMIS
          I have heard many confessions,
          d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not
          a priest, I could tell your heart
          has a secret weight, and it is
          hurting you to carry it alone.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The secret I carry I cannot share.
          Not even with God.

D'Artagnan moves to the door.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I cannot betray Louis.  I will
          defend him with my life.

                     ARAMIS
          I know.  God go with you.

D'Artagnan leaves Aramis alone in the secret chapel.

EXT.  THE MONASTERY - NIGHT

Aramis leads Athos and Porthos out of the catacombs.

                     ARAMIS
          This way.

They move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery.  A
hooded Jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows, then
recognizes Aramis and admits the trio to the monastery's
forge, where more hooded Jesuits are working in secret,
heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace.

                     ATHOS
          What are they doing?

                     ARAMIS
          Making the key to the throne.

                     PORTHOS
          They are very large keys.

One of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red
from the fire; he hammers it in a shower of sparks and
plunges it into water.  Aramis pulls the result from the
water and shows it to Athos and Porthos.

It is an iron mask.

EXT.  A CARRIAGE - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The carriage rolls through the long sweep of the French
countryside, traveling fast.

INT.  THE CARRIAGE - NIGHT

The three Musketeers -- Aramis, Athos, and Porthos -- have
been traveling for some time.  Porthos is asleep, snoring.

                     ATHOS
          Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't
          you think it's time you told me what
          it is you are plotting?

                     ARAMIS
          Soon enough.  Here we are.

Kicking Porthos' feet to wake him, Aramis opens the carriage
door, and they step out...

EXT.  FRENCH COAST - NIGHT

Lying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the
imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore.

                     ATHOS
          The Prison of Belle Sur.

                     ARAMIS
          Come, we have a boat waiting.

As hooded Jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them,
Athos and Porthos glance at each other; Porthos shrugs.

EXT.  AMONG ROCKS AT THE BEACH - NIGHT

The guides lead the Musketeers down a hilly path to a long
boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast.
Sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's
garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of
a mummy, with a rope tied at either end.

The guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf.
Aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked.
He's still fit and hard.  With the guides helping him, he
lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist.

                     ATHOS
          What is that?

                     ARAMIS
          A body.

                     ATHOS
          I see that is a body!  But where did
          you get it?

Aramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in
priest's garb.  With the robes spreading over the big bundle
added artfully to Aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat
priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds
to the illusion of Aramis as a wild, reclusive monk.

The sun is beginning to come up over the mountains.

                     PORTHOS
          He gets one day of confession each
          year.  Today is the day.

                     ATHOS
          Who does?

                     PORTHOS
          Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even
          talk about it.

Aramis steps onto the boat.  The little priest who first
joined them gets in too, along with a couple of rowers.

                     ATHOS
          What do we do now?

                     PORTHOS
          I don't know about you, but I plan
          to wait here.

The rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison.

INT.  FORTRESS PRISON - DAY

The pink light of the new day barely penetrates the gloom of
the prison.  The boat carrying Aramis and the little priest
reaches the gate of the prison, which reaches to the water
line.  As Aramis steps out, GUARDS meet them.

                     HEAD GUARD
          Who is this, then?

The little priest remains in the boat, slumped over.  One
GUARD speaks to the little priest in Italian, and the little
priest seems barely able to left his head; Aramis answers for
him, in Italian, and the guard translates --

                     GUARD
          He says he's the replacement.

Aramis rattles off more Italian.

                     GUARD
          He says it is only one day a month
          when the prisoner gets confession,
          and the little one is too sick to
          move.  The big one doesn't speak
          French either.

                     HEAD GUARD
          Then let's get it done.

The head guard gestures to let them pass.

INT.  CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK

The prisoner has used the torn Bible to make all sorts of
amazing origami, invented from his own head.  He looks up as
he hears the door open, and sees Aramis, the priest.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          My confession day!  But where is the
          other one?

Aramis says something in Latin -- the first words of the
ceremony of absolution -- as the guards lock the door behind
him and move off down the corridor.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I know you don't speak my language
          -- but is the other one all right?
          Please tell me he is not dead too,
          or I will have lost everyone.

Aramis goes on mumbling Latin mechanically, for the sake of
the retreating guards.  The Man in the Iron Mask is desperate
for someone to talk to.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I... tore my Bible.  Or someone else
          did.  But it was all right.  "Let the
          words of my mouth and the
          meditations of my heart be
          acceptable in Thy sight, Oh Lord our
          God and My Redeemer."

Aramis has stopped talking, and stares transfixed at this
sight of the prisoner, in the iron mask.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I'm sorry.  You're never seen me
          before.  I must frighten you.

Aramis puts his finger to his lips.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What are you doing?  Why do you --

Aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole, and whispers --

                     ARAMIS
          I am a friend, here to help you.

Aramis hurriedly removes his robes, revealing the bundle.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What -- ?

                     ARAMIS
          It is an escape.  To freedom.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Freedom...?

He says it as if the concept is beyond him.  Aramis undoes
the bundle, revealing the limp body.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Wh-- ?  He is dead!  Who is he?

                     ARAMIS
          He is you.

Aramis uncovers the head of the body.  It is covered in a
mask, identical to the prisoner's.

INT.  PRISON CORRIDOR - CELL

The Guards are sharing a bottle of wine, when they hear --

                     ARAMIS
          Hey!  Hey!

                     GUARD
          What now?

INT.  CELL

The guards enter to find the Man in the Iron Mask slumped on
the floor.  Aramis, looking like the fat priest again, stands
over him spouting Italian, as one GUARD translates --

                     GUARD
          He says he just fell stone dead as
          he was reading him the Mass.

                     HEAD GUARD
          I never thought the bugger would
          last this long.  But how could he
          just keel over and --

Aramis rattles off more Italian, and suddenly the guard who
understands it stops examining the body and backs off.

                     GUARD
          He says the prisoner has the fever,
          just like the little priest does.

                     HEAD GUARD
          Plague?  They brought plague in
          here?  Get him out of here.  Now!

Aramis rattles off a protest in Italian.

                     GUARD
          No, no last rites!  Get away!

EXT.  PRISON - DAY

Aramis climbs into the boat; as he sits down his belly stirs,
but the guards don't see it -- they are using poles to push
the boat away, into the sea.

EXT.  THE COASTLINE - DAY

Athos and Porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore, and
tucks in among the rocks.  Sheltered from the view from the
prison, Aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes.

The prisoner dangles, tied wrist and ankle, from around
Aramis' neck.

                     ATHOS
          My God...

Athos, Porthos, and the others gawk at the sight of the Man
in the Iron Mask, as Aramis loosens the ropes.  As they back
away from him, he sees the sky.  Endless blue -- and bright.
He shields his eyes.

                     ARAMIS
          It's all right.  Take your time.

Aramis helps him up, and turn him slowly around, to face...

The fortress/prison, in the distance.

THE PRISONER'S POV FROM WITHIN THE MASK:  A vast vista -- the
sky, the sea, and the prison on the island in the middle of
it all.  The prisoner falls to his knees, and weeps.

                     ARAMIS
          Athos... He needs a gentle hand.

Athos moves over hesitantly, and puts his hand on the
shoulder of the Man in the Iron Mask, who holds his hands
against the mask as if to further hide his shame.

INT.  THE PRISON - DAY

The guards are standing in the cell, looking down at the body
now wearing the mask, the man they think was their prisoner.
The guards are quiet, alone.

                     GUARD 1
          You ever wonder who he was?

                     GUARD 2
          No... Yes.  But I never asked -- and
          you better not either.

They wrap the body, still in its mask, in a weighted sack.

EXT.  PRISON - DAY

The prison's WARDEN GENERAL stands at the wall of the
fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw
off the body, wrapped in canvas weighted with stones.  As the
corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea, the Warden
writes a message on a royal scroll:

               THE UNSEEN PRISONER IS DEAD.

The Warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger.

EXT.  COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

A carriage pulls into a country estate, isolated among vast
woodlands silver in the moonlight.  Mysterious servants with
shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops.

INT.  CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Athos reaches for his sword, but Aramis stops his hand.

                     ARAMIS
          Jesuits.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE COURTYARD - NIGHT

Aramis emerges quickly, whispering directives to the Jesuits;
Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask from the carriage, his
head shrouded by a cloak.

Aramis has a blacksmith waiting; almost before he realizes it
the Man in the Iron Mask finds his head placed on an anvil;
but as the hammer rises he begins to scream.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No!  Please!

                     ARAMIS
          What is wrong?  We only mean to free
          you from the mask!

But the prisoner is shaking, and Athos understands why.

                     ATHOS
          Prison was horrible but it was his
          home.  He's been torn from it by
          strangers.  He's frightened,
          exhausted -- and the mask is
          familiar.  Let him rest in it
          tonight, and remove it tomorrow.

                     ARAMIS
          Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen
          sense of this man.

                     ATHOS
          His plight is obvious, isn't it?

Athos, angry with Aramis' arrogance and insensitivity, leads
the Man in the Iron Mask toward the house; then Aramis spots
Porthos, looking downcast.

                     ARAMIS
          And why are you so glum?

                     PORTHOS
          I expected action.  There was no
          killing, no fighting, I was useless.

In deep depression, Porthos climbs out and shuffles off.
Aramis sighs, shakes his head, and walks to the house.

INT.  MANOR HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask onto the bed; the eyes
behind the slits in the mask are darting, frightened.

                     ATHOS
          Are you hungry?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Just... water.

Athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table;
but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid
spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          This way.

The prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a
drink, then falls back to the pillow.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          This place... I once lived in a
          country house.  I had guardians --
          an old man and woman.  And tutors.
          But no friends.  Then when I was
          twelve, they came and took me to the
          prison.

                     ATHOS
          Who came?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          A man in black.  I never saw his
          face.  He took me to the cell.  A
          blacksmith came and they put me into
          the mask.  For days I shouted, "What
          have I done?  Why do you do this to
          me?"  But no one heard, so I just
          stopped shouting.

                     ATHOS
          And you never knew why?

                     PRISONER
          I thought... there is something
          about my face that men do not want
          to see.  Something that makes them
          cruel.  But then I realized they
          were cruel even when I was wearing
          the mask.  I knew there must be some
          other reason, but I could not think
          what it was.

                     ATHOS
          What is your name?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          The old man and woman called me...
          Phillippe.

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe.  Rest now.

Athos moves to the door.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Thank you... for your kindness.

Athos nods, pauses a moment... and leaves.

INT.  A DARK APARTMENT IN PARIS - NIGHT

The lock rattles, and the door swings open.  D'Artagnan
enters, lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room.
It is Athos' apartment, the one he visited earlier; now he
finds it empty, devoid of clues.  He stands there alone.

He turns to leave, then glimpses a familiar painting hanging
beside the door.  Lifting his light he studies the portrait:
Athos, Aramis, Porthos and himself -- four Musketeers, beat
friends, in their prime.  Together then, inseparable.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          My friends... Where have you gone?

He lowers the lantern, and leaves.

                                                  CUT TO:

THE MESSAGE FROM THE PRISON...

has reached the court.  Gloved hands pass the message from
one advisor to another, and finally to the King.

INT.  PALACE - KING'S STUDY - DAY

The King reads the message, rerolls it, thinks a moment, and
hands the scroll to Claude.

                     LOUIS
          Take this to my mother.

THE MESSAGE

is again passed, this time into the hands of the Queen
Mother's eldest nun-attendant, and then into the hands of the
Queen Mother herself.  The Queen is in her private rooms, and
for the first time we see her with her hair down.  She
accepts the scroll, opens it, and reads.

Her eyes fill with pain, grief, guilt... emotions she hides,
turning away.

                     NUN
          M'lady... are you...?

                     ANNE
          Please, just... go away.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan returns from his ride to Athos' place.  He looks
down at the Queen's door.  He checks the clock on the wall;
it is a few minutes past nine.  He enters his room, moves to
the window, and waits there, to catch a glimpse of her.

INT.  COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is digging into a hearty meal, while Porthos only
stares at his plate.

                     ARAMIS
          See?  There is plenty of food in the
          country.  But the King keeps it
          going to the army instead of --

Athos marches in, all business.

                     ATHOS
          He is sleeping.  Now see here,
          Aramis, it's time you told us --

He breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to
spoon food onto Porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his
nose, and she gives him a smile.

                     PORTHOS
          I have no appetite for food, I am
          wasting away.  Say goodbye to
          Porthos, for he is gone.  Even women
          don't interest me now.

The girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who
seem fascinated with the roguish Porthos; their giggles and
winks make Porthos even more morose; he tells his friends...

                     PORTHOS
          I tell you a secret.  I sleep with
          three women at once, not because my
          appetite is so great, but because
          now it take three to excite me.

Porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; Aramis
sighs, having heard all this before.  Athos sits down.

                     ATHOS
          Who is he, Aramis?

                     ARAMIS
          Tomorrow.

                     ATHOS
          Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man
          from a royal prison, we hide in a
          country chateau among an assortment
          of saints and sluts such as only you
          could provide, and still you wish to
          tell me nothing?!

                     ARAMIS
          You seek facts, when it would be
          better to seek truth.

                     ATHOS
          You are not my priest, Aramis!  You
          would not be, even if I had one.

                     ARAMIS
          You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn
          by grief, not only for Raoul, but
          for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and
          now treat as an enemy.

                     ATHOS
          He who is not with us is against us.

                     ARAMIS
          Those are the words of a broken
          spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have
          trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest
          secrets, and I will never believe
          he is my enemy.

                     ATHOS
          Then you are a fool -- a fool who
          has never lost a son.  What gives
          you the right to judge me, to play
          God with the lives of others?  Is it
          because you are so much holier than
          everyone else?!

                     ARAMIS
          There is that, of course -- but
          mainly it is because I am so much
          smarter than everyone else.

They are interrupted by Porthos' bloodcurdling SCREAM.

                     ARAMIS
          Porthos?!

He draws his sword and runs for the outside.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT

Aramis and Athos rush through the courtyard, surrounded by
moonlight and trees, confused about where Porthos is.  Then
they hear bellowing SCREAM OF PAIN from the latrine.

Swords drawn, they bang into the latrine, to find Porthos
just finishing urinating.

                     PORTHOS
          Kidney rocks.  It hurts when I pee.
          It hurts when I shit.  I'm just a
          fat old fart with nothing to live
          for any more.  I'm going to hang
          myself, as soon as I'm sober.

They watch him shuffle toward the main house.

INT.  THE PALACE - THE QUEEN MOTHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Anne paces in her room, her hands trembling, her beautiful
lips quivering with tortured emotion.  With a sudden impulse
she bolts from her room, through the outer room where her
attendants sit, and into the corridor.

                     NUN
          M'lady...?

The eldest nun follows her.

EXT.  PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT

Anne rushes through the evening, toward her little chapel in
the palace garden; she is a tragic, romantic sight, her long
hair flying behind her as she runs.

IN HIS ROOM, D'ARTAGNAN

has been standing at his window, for his nightly glimpse of
Anne.  Now he sees her, not with her retinue of nuns, but
running to her chapel, clearly distraught...

INT./ EXT.  PALACE GARDEN - GARDEN CHAPEL - NIGHT

Anne reaches the door, and finds a few nuns and an old priest
praying in the little chapel.  She staggers forward to the
altar.  and falls to her knees there.  The nuns and the old
priest, seeing the Queen Mother so distraught, stand silently
and file out, leaving her in solitude.

                     ANNE
          Oh God I -- Forgive me...

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          M'lady...?

She whirls to see him; the sight of her face, bursting with
emotions she has kept buried, draws him nearer.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          What -- ?

                     ANNE
          No, stay back!  Stay back!

He freezes in his tracks; she holds her hands out toward him
as if warding off a blow.  He's desperate to move to her; she
sees it on his face.

                     ANNE
          D'Artagnan!

Her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away; she
rushes into his arms.  They clutch each other, in an embrace
they have denied for many years.  They kiss hungrily.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          M'lady... if anyone sees, it is
          death...

                     ANNE
          If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I can't bear to see you cry.  What
          is wrong?

                     ANNE
          Nothing... Nothing.

She draws back; he tries to hold her.  But the thoughts of
answering that question makes her stiffen.

                     ANNE
          Nothing.  This... didn't happen.  I
          must go back now.

And just like that, their moment is gone.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

D'Artagnan and Anne move back to the palace in a stiff
procession, she walking ahead, he trailing like a proper
commoner, several feet behind.

INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

They reach the Queen Mother's room; d'Artagnan reaches to
open the door for her, and she keeps her eyes lowered.  But
before he can let her go, he must whisper...

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Anne...!  I know... I know that to
          love you is treason against France.
          But not to love you... is treason
          against my heart.

                     ANNE
          Then we will both die traitors,
          d'Artagnan.

With those whispered words hanging in the air, she enters her
room.  And d'Artagnan moves alone, back to his.

INT.  MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The King is trying to make love with Michelle -- but she
isn't responding.  He stops, exasperated.

                     LOUIS
          What is wrong?

She says nothing.  He tries kissing her again.

                     LOUIS
          What is wrong?!

She begins weeping uncontrollably, and turns from him.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul... Oh, Raoul...

                     LOUIS
          Listen, my darling... Raoul was
          a... a good friend.  And now he is
          dead and that is very sad but --

                     MICHELLE
          We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.

The King stands; he's had enough of this.

                     LOUIS
          No, my love.  You will burn in hell,
          for your sins.  But I will not --
          for I am King.  My position is
          ordained by God.

He snatches the gold coverlet from her bed to cover his naked
body and stalks to his stairway; the embroidered coverlet
trails behind him like a regal train in a royal procession.
Leaving her weeping, he moves down into...

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King angrily stalks around his bedroom, too agitated to
sleep.  He grabs food from the table by the window, and
starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops.  He sees
something out the window; it stops him dead cold.

It is a man, standing in the gardens, wearing an iron mask.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan!  Guards!

EXT.  GARDENS - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT

The apparition ducks into the shadows.

INT.  PALACE - D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has
just happened when he hears the king's shouts of alarm.

                     LOUIS' VOICE
          Help!

In an instant d'Artagnan is reacting, snatching up his sword
and racing out into the corridor, toward the King's room.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The guards outside the King's room find the door latched from
within, and they don't know what to do... D'Artagnan, running
up, never slows down; he crashes into the doors.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King whirls as the doors explode inward and d'Artagnan
barrels through.

                     LOUIS
          Out there!  Look!  Out there!  He --

The garden is empty.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I just left the garden, it was
          empty.  What did you see?

                     LOUIS
          It... was nothing.  A nightmare,
          nothing more.  Go away, I --

D'Artagnan guides his guards out, but glances back to see the
King, ashamed and worried.  D'Artagnan tells his men --

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Check the garden.

EXT.  GARDEN - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT

An old Jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where
the nuns have returned to pray.  He kneels at a back pew,
tucking the iron mask deep within his robes.  The young
Musketeers who move through the garden glance into the
chapel, see only the normal piety, and move on.  The old
priest crosses himself, bows his head, and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE - PHILLIPPE'S EYES, THROUGH THE SLITS OF THE MASK

They are frightened.  As we PULL BACK we see the Iron Mask,
in an OVERHEAD POV... Phillippe is lying on his back, his
head resting on an anvil.  Athos stands close by, lending
support; Aramis and Porthos look on.  A blacksmith stands
over Phillippe.  He positions the point of his chisel against
the lock of the mask.  It takes several ringing hammer blows
-- which we experience from a POV WITHIN THE MASK -- before
the lock breaks.

Athos, as gently as he can, pries open the iron mask.

PHILLIPPE'S FACE

is a wretched sight, overgrown with a matted tangle of hair
and beard, and with a deathly pallor.

Phillippe sits up, lifting his head out of the mask.  He
looks at the Musketeers, watching them for their reactions.
At first they are frozen; then there is recognition, awe.

Phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge, and looks
down into THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, at his REFLECTION.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly
          like... exactly like...

                     ARAMIS
          I will answer all your questions.
          But first soap, water, and a razor.

INT.  THE MANOR HOUSE'S MAIN DINING ROOM - DAY

Aramis and Porthos are sitting at the table when Athos ushers
in --

PHILLIPPE, CLEANED UP

The change in him is remarkable, and his face so identical to
the King's that Porthos actually jumps.  Phillippe takes a
seat opposite Aramis, and looks around, wary, vulnerable.

                     ARAMIS
          Yes.  Identical.

Aramis' eyes are aflame as he looks across at Phillippe.

                     ARAMIS
          The greatest secret of life is who
          we truly are.  Now I must give you
          that secret, which has been kept
          from you your whole life.  It began
          on the night when Louis was born.

                     PORTHOS
          I remember that night.  D'Artagnan
          was drunk, the only time I've seen
          him that way.  The three of us were
          reveling, remember, Athos?

                     ARAMIS
          But I was on duty...

IN FLASHBACK...

We see the shadowy Musketeer we saw in the opening, moving up
the dark steps of the palace.  We see now it was Aramis.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          I was summoned to the royal
          apartments.  Arrange a carriage,
          they told me, and wait by the door
          of the stables.

INTERCUT FLASHBACK

We see images of that night, as we saw in the opening.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          They brought a baby from the back of
          the palace, into the black carriage
          I had waiting.  They had given the
          driver instructions about where it
          was, and I was ordered to make the
          whole journey with the blinds of the
          carriage drawn.

In the flashback we see the young Musketeer Aramis, his face
shielded in shadow, handing a living bundle over to someone
at one of the back doors of a large country house.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          I carried that baby into the
          countryside, to a chateau, like this
          one.  And there I left him.

ARAMIS IN THE PRESENT

                     ARAMIS
          I have never forgotten that night,
          or what I carried.

                     PORTHOS
          I don't understand.  What does this
          have to do with...?  You carried a
          baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --

                     ARAMIS
          Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried
          the child of the king.

                     PORTHOS
          The child of the king is... the
          king.  Louis!

                     ARAMIS
          No, not Louis!

                     PORTHOS
          Athos, do you understand this?  He
          confuses me --

                     ARAMIS
          I carried the king's child!  The
          queen had twins that night, and one
          of them was sent away, in secret!

                     PORTHOS
          But why?

                     ARAMIS
          Because the old king had a twin as
          well, and through his whole reign
          his brother fought him for the
          throne.  Then he had two heirs, not
          just sons but twins.  So he decided
          that one be put away, as if he never
          existed.  You, Phillippe.

Phillippe is pale... We DISSOLVE TO a flashback of
Phillippe's early education in the country house.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          The old king ordered you be educated
          and well treated, but your identity
          kept from you and all those around
          you.

The FLASHBACK moves to the palace, matching the narration --

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          On his death bed, he revealed your
          existence to Louis and your mother.
          Your mother had been told by her own
          priest that you had died at birth.
          Somehow she blamed herself for ever
          believing it, and she wished to
          restore your birthright.  But now
          Louis was king.

We see in FLASHBACK Louis wearing his new crown, plotting.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          A priest, even a Pope, he could kill
          without hesitation, but he was
          afraid to kill you, for his whole
          claim to power rests on the sanctity
          of royal blood.  So he had you
          hidden in a way that only a monster
          could devise.  I know, for it was I
          who took you to prison, and the Iron
          Mask.  Someday I will ask your
          forgiveness.  But not until we have
          restored to you what is yours.

We are in present time again.  All eyes are on Phillippe.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Restored...?

                     ARAMIS
          We will replace Louis with
          Phillippe.  No one but the King
          himself -- and now we -- knows
          Phillippe even exists.  All we have
          to do is switch them.

                     ATHOS
          Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is
          ludicrous!

                     ARAMIS
          I have it all worked out.

                     ATHOS
          Physical resemblance is but one
          small thing!  Louis has an
          arrogance, a manner --

                     ARAMIS
          Those can be adopted --

                     ATHOS
          And people close to him, who --

                     ARAMIS
          Do you think I have not considered
          that?  I have a plan -- and you may
          rest assured that it is brilliant!

                     ATHOS
          It is not just our lives you risk
          with this conceit of yours!  It is
          Phillippe's as well!

                     ARAMIS
          Yes, and he has a choice!

Aramis stops thundering at Athos, and turns to Phillippe.

                     ARAMIS
          What about it, Phillippe?!  All that
          time in prison, all that time you
          suffered, was it for nothing?!  You
          memorized the entire Bible, or so
          your priest told me!  An act of
          survival, of defiance, of courage!
          Your years within the mask have
          given you reserves of strength that
          others could not imagine.  Your home
          was a dungeon and now you may be a
          king, if you have the heart to make
          it so!  Do you have the heart?

Phillippe stands shakily, and faces them.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I will try.

Phillippe walks -- nearly wanders -- from the room.

                     ARAMIS
          You see?  A king.

Athos, with a glare at Aramis, follows Phillippe.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE GARDENS - DAY

The gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a
French summer.  Athos finds Phillippe there, sitting alone.

                     ATHOS
          Recent hours have been a shock.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Perhaps not as much as you might
          imagine.  When tutors answered every
          question except those about who I
          was.  When I was imprisoned in a way
          no other man had ever been, I knew
          there was something different about
          me.  But a king...

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe... there is something I
          hope you understand.  Terrible
          cruelty has been used against you.
          And... you must understand that you
          did nothing to deserve it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          There is... wrath... in me.  I have
          learned to hide it.  Those years in
          the cell, I dreamed that freedom
          would someday just happen, the way
          the mask happened.  Now I am free.
          And with each free breath I feel the
          growing desire to make someone
          suffer for all I lost.  Look at
          this, all this that for ten years I
          could not see!  What if I become a
          king -- a king no different from my
          brother?

                     ATHOS
          The desire for vengeance... can be a
          poison.

                     PHILLIPPE
          What is its antidote?

                     ATHOS
          I suppose... it is to remember there
          are many people who have never been
          in a prison, who pass such beauty
          every day, and never see it.

Phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it.  He
looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in.
Athos looks around too; then Athos realizes Phillippe is no
longer looking at the garden, but at him.

                     PHILLIPPE
          You look so sad.  Is it something I
          have done?

                     ATHOS
          It is something I have done -- or
          did not do.

                     PHILLIPPE
          What is that?

                     ATHOS
          I did not share beauty with
          someone... who is no longer here for
          me to share beauty with.

Before Phillippe can pursue this, Athos turns businesslike.

                     ATHOS
          We have much to do, we'd best get
          started.  Now suppose you were to
          walk into a garden, as a king...

INT.  MANOR HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is having dinner; he calls toward the kitchen.

                     ARAMIS
          More wine!

Athos enters and sags into a chair, his energy spent.

                     ARAMIS
          How is he?

                     ATHOS
          Resting, he's had a long day.
          Aramis --

                     ARAMIS
               (calling out)
          More wine!!

                     ATHOS
          You must reconsider this plan.
          Phillippe is like a child, he --

                     ARAMIS
          You can do it.

                     ATHOS
          In a year, maybe two, I could teach
          him enough to --

                     ARAMIS
          Three days.

                     ATHOS
          Three days??!!

                     ARAMIS
          The King is having a ball, a
          masquerade ball.  It is the perfect
          opportunity and perhaps our only
          one.  At any time Phillippe could be
          discovered, and what then?  Remember
          France.  Remember the poor.
          Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where
          are those serving girls...?

EXT.  CHATEAU - NIGHT

As Aramis and Athos are downstairs arguing, we PAN UP to the
window of a candlelit bedroom...

INT.  CHATEAU BEDROOM - NIGHT

We PAN from the window to the bed... where Porthos is making
love -- or trying to.  We see his huge, bare, broad back,
blotting out all view of his partner.  He grunts, then roles
over in despair -- revealing not one but three serving girls
lying beneath him, jammed side-by-side like firewood, all
nearly smothered by Porthos' bulk.

                     PORTHOS
          It's no use.  My sword is bent.

                     SERVING WOMAN
          It'll be all right.  You're just
          taking a while to get started.

                     PORTHOS
          No, it's dead.  I am useless.

Porthos heaves himself out of bed.

EXT.  CHATEAU - NIGHT

While Aramis and Athos are visible through the window,
arguing and gesturing, Porthos -- still naked -- walks across
the moonlit courtyard, to the barn.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's
          perceptive, but he is in such
          turmoil --

                     ARAMIS
          You grow fond of him.  That's good.

                     ATHOS
          Don't play God with me, Aramis I --

Athos interrupts himself as he glimpses the naked Porthos
moving across the courtyard toward the barn.

                     ARAMIS
          Go on.

                     ATHOS
          But -- what is Porthos doing?

                     ARAMIS
          Going into the barn naked -- or so
          it appears.

We INTERCUT Porthos in the barn with Aramis and Athos in the
house...

IN THE BARN

Porthos, alone within the barn, finds a thick plow rope and
fashions a noose.

IN THE HOUSE

                     ARAMIS
          Now.  You were saying?

                     ATHOS
          But -- what is he doing?

                     ARAMIS
          About to hang himself, I should
          think.

IN THE BARN

Porthos throws one end of the rope over the central beam of
the barn, and ties the other end off.  He shoves a milking
stool up below the noose, climbs onto it, and fits the noose
around his neck.  NOTE: When we see him in full view it is
only from behind -- and this angle is a sight to behold.

IN THE HOUSE

Aramis' detachment only aggravates Athos' excitement.

                     ATHOS
          Hang himself?!

                     ARAMIS
          He's threatened to do it, it's been
          building up in him for months.

                     ATHOS
          We must stop him!

                     ARAMIS
          Come now, Athos, if Porthos is
          determined to end his life, then he
          will certainly manage to find the
          opportunity.

                     ATHOS
          But -- but --

Athos jumps up and makes for the door -- but Aramis' hooded
helpers, at a signal from Aramis, bar his way.

IN THE BARN

Porthos, grave with drama, utters his last words...

                     PORTHOS
          A'dieu, cruel life!  Farewell to
          useless Porthos!

He steps off the stool.

His great weight drops.  The rope snaps taught.  The beam it
is tied to snaps like a twig -- right in the place where it
has been sawn nearly in half already.

Porthos falls unencumbered and slams butt first into the
floorboards of the barn, cracking them.

ARAMIS AND ATHOS

can hear the crack from where they're sitting.

                     ARAMIS
          I sawed the main beam in half.

IN THE BARN

The chain reaction has just begun.  The broken floorboards
buckle, and the barn's walls, deprived of their central
support, fall in on each other.

IN THE FRONT ROOM

Athos and Aramis watch wide-eyed as the whole barn completely
collapses around the unfortunate Porthos.  Athos gives Aramis
a look.

                     ARAMIS
          I'm a genius -- not an engineer!

They jump up and run out.  The commotion draws others too --
especially the three wenches Porthos had been trying to bed.

THE COLLAPSED BARN

It's a tangle of debris -- and from the size and weight of
the pile, it looks as if no one could live through the
collapse.  For a moment the whole pile lies silent; then
suddenly it bursts apart and Porthos emerges, exploding with
anger.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis!!  You did this, didn't you!
          You knew I would try hanging myself,
          and you sawed the beam!  Admit it!
          Admit it, by God!!  ADMIT IT!!!

Porthos' eyes are bulging; he's terrifying in his fury.  And
he holds one of the broken barn's timbers like a giant club,
ready to bash in Aramis' brains.  Aramis is totally casual.

                     ARAMIS
          Well of course I knew it, Porthos.

Porthos stands there, blinking.

                     ARAMIS
          You've been moping for months.  Now
          that you've gotten the idea of
          killing yourself out of the way, you
          can stop boring me and start being
          useful to me.  Now get some rest.

                     PORTHOS
          Well... Well... Okay.

Porthos starts back toward the house.  Then one of the
serving girls, heading back inside, sees in one of the upper
windows -- the face in the Iron Mask.  She SCREAMS --

                     WENCH
          AAAAAAHHHHHHH!

Phillippe shies back from the window now, but it's too late,
everyone has seen him.  Aramis, with cold intellectual
curiosity, quietly observes the women's reaction, even as his
hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened
locals.

                     ATHOS
          Poor Phillippe!

                     ARAMIS
          The mask is terrifying... especially
          when unexpected.  Do you notice?

                     ATHOS
          All I noticed was that Phillippe
          feels even more like an animal.

Athos hurries in; Aramis looks at Porthos.

                     ARAMIS
          See, Porthos -- secrets are hard to
          keep.  We don't have much time.

INT.  PHILLIPPE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Athos enters to find Phillippe in a corner of the bedroom,
slumped and ashamed in the darkness, holding the mask.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I've worn this mask so long, I
          couldn't sleep without it.

                     ATHOS
          I will sit with you.  I can't sleep
          either.

Athos settles into a chair, as Phillippe lays the mask aside
on the table and closes his eyes.  Athos looks toward the
flames of the fireplace, and in their dancing shadows he sees
the face of Raoul.  Phillippe's voice interrupts --

                     PHILLIPPE
          Athos...?  Thank you for being my
          guide... back into the world.

Athos had not thought of it that way.  Phillippe closes his
eyes again, and falls asleep.

INT.  PHILLIPPE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Light falls on Athos' face; it is dawn.  He hears the whinny
of horses, and looks out the window to see a carriage about
to leave.  Reacting quickly, he hurries out quietly.

EXT.  CHATEAU - MORNING

Aramis and Porthos are already loaded into the carriage, as
Athos runs up.

                     ATHOS
          Where are you going?!

                     ARAMIS
          Paris.  There is still much to do.
          We'll be back soon.  Be ready.

                     ATHOS
          But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn
          in time, but --

                     ARAMIS
          He can learn to be Phillippe in
          time.  But first he must learn to be
          Louis, and for that he has two more
          days.

                     ATHOS
          What you're asking is impossible!

                     ARAMIS
          I offer you the perfect revolution.
          A revolution without bloodshed,
          without any loss of life, even
          without treason, for he too is the
          son of the King.

                     ATHOS
          But --

                     ARAMIS
          You said you'd do anything, Athos,
          anything to replace this King.  So
          do it.

Aramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives
the horses away.

Athos, wide-eyed and alone, watches the carriage roll away.
He turns back toward the house, and see's Phillippe looking
out the window -- without the mask.

INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Athos and Phillippe are having breakfast.

                     ATHOS
          No, wait, do not hold your goblet
          that way.  With a king it is... so.

He shows him, pinching the goblet between thumb and
forefinger, as the other three fingers extend daintily.

                     ATHOS
          It is not to be dainty.  Servants
          have touched the King's goblet, so
          he will touch it as little as
          possible.

Phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers,
crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --

                     ATHOS
          No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be
          sorry!  The King cares for nothing
          and for no one!  There are no
          mistakes when you are King!  What
          you do is right for every person!  A
          King has contempt for everyone!

                     PHILLIPPE
          Is that the king of king you wish me
          to be?  Or do you say this because
          of your son?

                     ATHOS
          How did you know -- ?

                     PHILLIPPE
          Porthos told me.

For a moment Athos can say nothing; then he shoves back from
the table and storms from the room.

INT.  COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - ATHOS' ROOM - NIGHT

Athos is pacing in his room, all alone, rehearsing the things
he wants to say to Phillippe.

                     ATHOS
          I am not... I am not angry with you.
          You understand?  Good.  Now, as to
          acting like a king, we wish you to
          be a good king.  But at first... at
          first you must pass as Louis, and
          Louis is cold and cruel.  So you
          must stop looking at people with
          such softness.  It is... not Kingly.
          The eyes of a King say that all he
          cares about is himself, and your
          eyes -- how do I tell him this -- ?
          You eyes... ask so much.  You
          shouldn't care about me, about my --
          about...

Athos' voice breaks, his body sags.

                     ATHOS
          Oh Raoul, my son... my son...

Athos weeps.

INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Phillippe sits alone in the parlor; he looks up as Athos --
his face washed, no sign of grief -- marches in.

                     ATHOS
          Come, we have much to do.

MONTAGE - ATHOS TRAINING PHILLIPPE

-- They practice sword fighting, Athos being sure that
   Phillippe knows Kingly posture...

-- They rehearse holding court, with Athos showing Phillippe
   how to sit in a chair like a King on his throne, and then
   Phillippe trying it, with Athos then playing the roll of a
   courtesan paying homage...

-- They rehearse courtly dancing; and as they stumble, both
   of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous, they laugh.

EXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Aramis' carriage rattles to a stop, the hooves of the horses
sounding hollow on the cobblestones.  They are near the same
area where the riots occurred; now, at night, everything
looks deserted.  Aramis steps from the carriage.

                     ARAMIS
          Coming?

                     PORTHOS
          What use am I?

                     ARAMIS
          We go someplace dangerous.

                     PORTHOS
          Why didn't you say so?

Porthos steps out with him, and Aramis leads the way down a
dark, spooky alley.

EXT.  PARIS BACKSTREETS - NIGHT

They walk through the murky darkness of Paris' backstreets.

                     PORTHOS
          It is good to be out on a mission
          again... We are out on a mission,
          aren't we?

Aramis grunts non-committally, lost in thought.

                     PORTHOS
          You're right.  Tell Porthos nothing.
          He needs to know nothing, for he is
          useless.

Just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows
and blocks their way.  He holds a knife.  Another ROBBER with
a sword rises from a doorway beside them.

                     ROBBER
          Your money or your life.

Aramis looks bored; Porthos stands blinking in surprise.
Then a third robber steps up behind them, cocking a pistol.

                     THIRD ROBBER
          Make it quick, old man!

                     PORTHOS
          Old?  Old?!  You're all trying to
          rob us because you think we're old?

The man with a sword steps forward to hack Porthos down, but
Porthos spins, slapping the pistol, making it BOOM but miss;
he kicks the swordsman in the groin, then smashes his head
against the alley wall; he backhands the gunman.  The robber
with the knife tries to run; Porthos snatches a barrel from
the street and hurls it into the fleeing robber's back; he
falls in a heap.

Porthos' fury has just begun.  He picks the fallen gunman up
by the throat, slams him stomach down across a broken alley
cart, and with one sweep of his mighty hand Porthos snatches
down the man's pants.

                     PORTHOS
          Old?!  I'll show you old!!

Porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones.  We see
the shock and terror on the robber's face as he feels
something shocking happen behind him.

                     PORTHOS
          Let's see you rob somebody with your
          pistol there!

                     ARAMIS
          Come on...

Aramis, acting as if nothing happened, leads Porthos away.

                     PORTHOS
          I have to tell you something.  I
          love Paris!

Aramis has found what he's looking for:  a filthy brothel.

                     ARAMIS
          Here we are.

Aramis leads Porthos inside.

INT.  BROTHEL - NIGHT

Sleazy whores lounge around, women at the very bottom of
life.  They stir and try to look more appealing as the two
well dressed gentlemen enter.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis... These are... these are
          whores!

                     ARAMIS
          So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord
          loved her.

                     PORTHOS
          Did she have tits like that?

A greasy, disgusting PIMP shuffles over.

                     PIMP
          What do you want?  White?  Black?
          Both?

                     ARAMIS
          No.  We want you, Father Belles.

The pimp reacts with fury, drawing a pistol.

                     PIMP
          Get out!  Now!  I will kill you
          where you stand!

Aramis slowly falls to his knees, before the pimp.

                     ARAMIS
          Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

The pimp -- the former Father Belles, the same man we saw as
the priest who prayed with the Queen at the royal birth in
the opening -- shoves his pistol at Aramis' face.

                     PIMP
          Don't!  Get out!

                     ARAMIS
          I have sinned.  And no other
          priest's assurance of forgiveness
          can mean as much as yours.  Tell me
          that I can be forgiven, no matter
          what I have done.

Aramis' eyes are hypnotic, staring deep into the fallen
priest's soul.  Porthos is bug-eyed, certain Aramis' head is
about to be blown apart.

                     PORTHOS
          He's going to kill you, Aramis.

                     ARAMIS
          Then let him kill me, if all my
          faith is wrong.

He stares at the pimp.  The pimp's finger trembles on the
trigger.

                     ARAMIS
          I have come to help you make it
          right.  I have come to take you
          home.

The pimp shakes convulsively; he drops to his knees, bows his
head, and weeps.

EXT.  STREETS OF PARIS - NIGHT

Aramis' carriage rattles through the dark streets; we play
these secret movement sequences with an ominous, Jack-the-
Ripper quality.  The carriage pulls into...

INT.  CATHEDRAL COURTYARD - NIGHT

The priests scurry out to meet it.  First Aramis emerges,
then Porthos -- but the appearance of the pimp surprises the
cathedral priests.  They cross themselves.

                     PRIESTS
          Father Belles!

Crossing themselves, they embrace the prodigal priest; one
MONK kneels before Aramis.

                     MONK
          You have made a miracle!

                     ARAMIS
          God makes miracles.  You make
          dinner.

As Aramis strides toward the dining room, a Jesuit hurries up
to him.

                     JESUIT
          The ball has been rescheduled -- for
          tomorrow.

As Aramis hears this in surprise --

                                                SMASH TO:

EXT.  ROADS - NIGHT

The carriage thunders through the countryside, back toward
the manor house.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Athos and Phillippe sit at a table in the shade of a tree; on
the table is a model of the palace which Athos is using to
drill Phillippe on the palace's layout.

                     ATHOS
          These rooms are yours.  Up these
          stairs -- or through this hidden
          passage -- is the room of your
          mistress... Michelle.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Whose rooms are those?

                     ATHOS
          Your mother's.

They are interrupted as the carriage bearing Aramis and
Porthos clatters in.  Aramis is out immediately.

                     ARAMIS
          Change the horses!  Clear out
          everything!  NOW!!

INT.  CARRIAGE - ROLLING - DAY

The three Musketeers, plus Phillippe, are hurrying back
toward Paris.

                     ATHOS
          Aramis, this will never --

                     ARAMIS
          Louis is planning a visit to the
          Vatican, then who knows where after
          that.  If we miss him now we may not
          get another chance.

                     ATHOS
          But --

                     ARAMIS
          It presses us but it is good for us
          too!  Louis' whims make him more
          vulnerable.  We are less ready, but
          so are his guards!

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan, unready?

                     ATHOS
          At a ball, everyone watches the
          King!

                     ARAMIS
          But what if something extraordinary
          happened?  Something so unusual that
          all the attention went to someone
          else?  Someone whose confirmation of
          Phillippe the King would never be
          questioned.

                     PORTHOS
          Who?

                     ARAMIS
          The Queen Mother.  Anne.

And Aramis leans forward to tell them his plan...

EXT.  PALACE - DAY

Teams of servants are filing in and out of the palace with
food and flowers, decorating the ballroom for the ball that
evening.  In contrast, Anne and her devout retinue of nuns
move in single file toward the garden chapel.

INT.  GARDEN CHAPEL - DAY

The nuns kneel at the altar as Anne enters the confessional.

INT.  CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY

                     ANNE
          Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

                     FATHER BELLES
          So have I.

He slides open the partition window between them.

                     ANNE
          Father Belles -- ?!

He taps a silencing finger to his lips.

                     ANNE
          They told me you were dead.

                     FATHER BELLES
          I was.  I see you are still a woman
          of faith.  I have come back to ask
          you if you believe that one lie can
          poison your whole life... and one
          truth can put it back together
          again.

Anne stares at the eyes of the priest, back from hell.

INT.  PALACE - KING'S ROOM - DAY

As Louis' tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock
costume, complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand,
he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful
young women arriving early for the ball.

                     LOUIS
          It shall be interesting tonight.

D'Artagnan enters, looking concerned.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty.  This ball, with an
          open invitation to the nobility of
          Paris -- we have no way of
          checking --

                     LOUIS
          You will protect me as you always
          have, d'Artagnan.

Through the window Louis sees more beautiful young women.

                     LOUIS
          By the way, Claude -- inform
          Mademoiselle Beaufort that she will
          be moving from her rooms --

He looks up to see that Michelle has entered through the open
door behind him.

                     LOUIS
          Never mind, it seems we have already
          told her.

But Michelle's appearance brings him up short.  It is not the
cruel brush-off; she is already harshly different:  her eyes
are red from crying, her lips are tight in anger.

                     MICHELLE
          Murderer!  Murderer!

She holds a letter, crushed in her hand.

                     MICHELLE
          I wrote Fromberge!  Under your seal!
          I wrote as you, demanding to know
          why he disregarded my order to keep
          Raoul from danger!  He writes back:
          "But your Majesty!  Your last letter
          ordered me to put him in front of
          the cannon!"

She hurls the crumpled letter into his face.  Everyone is
frozen, silent.  She staggers toward Louis as if to attack
him, then falls to her knees, weeping.  No one helps her...

Except d'Artagnan.  He kneels, hugs her shoulders, helps her
to her feet, and guides her toward her room.  But d'Artagnan
looks back once, toward Louis.

                     LOUIS
          Hysterical woman.

                     CLAUDE
          Sire, misuse of the royal seal -- !

                     LOUIS
          She'll be gone tomorrow.

As d'Artagnan and Michelle move out, they pass Anne, coming
in.  Anne and d'Artagnan exchange a look; he remembers to
give her a respectful nod, but she moves past, into the
King's dressing room.  Louis is surprised.

                     LOUIS
          Mother -- ?

                     ANNE
          May I speak with you?  Alone?

                     LOUIS
          I am preparing for a ball!

                     ANNE
          We haven't visited in three years.
          And we should have privacy.

Exasperated, Louis waves his attendants away.

                     LOUIS
          What is it, mother?

                     ANNE
          I wish to discuss your brother.

                     LOUIS
          He is dead!  By God's choice!  There
          is nothing to discuss.

                     ANNE
          First they told me he had died at
          birth.  Then your father admitted he
          was alive, but well cared for, in
          secret.  But the message that told
          of his death said he had been a
          prisoner.

                     LOUIS
          I am King, Mother!  And I do not
          wish to discuss this with you.

                     ANNE
          He was my blood -- and I demand to
          know what happened to him.

                     LOUIS
          Why would you ask now?  You never
          asked before!

                     ANNE
          Because I have dreamed of him.  Not
          as the baby they took away, but as a
          man.

                     LOUIS
          You have prayed too much.  Your mind
          is weak.

Avoiding her stare, Louis lifts a plaster bust of his father,
its eyes like the sightless pupils of Greek gods.

                     ANNE
          I believe in dreams, Louis.  They
          are our souls speaking to us, from
          that world beyond our eyes.  And
          that son I never saw in daylight was
          standing in the moonlight of my
          dreams.  And he wore an iron mask.

We see her from a low angle, from a POV behind Louis -- and
we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor.

                     LOUIS
          It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He
          is dead now!  Dead!

                     ANNE
          Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The
          night of my dream.

And the night of Louis' "dream."  Anne begins to walk out.

                     LOUIS
          If... if he was wearing an iron mask
          in your dream, then how could you
          know he was your son?

Louis smiles; he thinks he has her.

                     ANNE
          Then you did do it, Louis.  You did
          put your brother in an iron mask.

All the blood is gone from Louis' face.  Anne walks from the
room, past Louis' waiting tailors.  He snaps at them.

                     LOUIS
          I have a ball to attend!

They rush in.  As they scurry about, dressing him in gold,
Louis' composure returns; he stares at himself in the golden
mirror, likes what he sees... and smiles.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Aramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees.  The
Musketeers and Phillippe pile out, to find another much
grander carriage there waiting.  Aramis ushers them into it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Whose carriage is this?

                     PORTHOS
          It was mine.  But since you are
          about to be the king, it is yours.

The new carriage lurches away.

INSIDE THE NEW CARRIAGE

are bundles of elaborate clothes.

                     ARAMIS
          Phillippe first.

They begin to dress Phillippe in a masquerade costume.

                     ARAMIS
          Remember, Phillippe... nobility is
          born in the heart.

                     ATHOS
          Hold your goblet with two fingers.

                     PORTHOS
          And make love as if you don't care.
          The way Kings do.  And fart whenever
          you wish.

Aramis tucks a note into Phillippe's pocket.

                     ARAMIS
          Remember, all you have to do is get
          through tonight.  Smile and nod a
          lot, and if you get stuck just wave
          and announce, "Continue."  In the
          morning you hand this note to
          d'Artagnan, pardoning Athos and
          instructing that he, Aramis and
          Porthos be brought to the palace as
          your advisors.  And all is well.

Phillippe nods; everyone's nervous.  Aramis grabs more
clothes and hands them out.

                     ARAMIS
          Now the rest of us.

EXT.  THE PALACE - NIGHT

Carriages disgorge guests, wildly attired for the masquerade
ball.  Porthos' carriage pulls in among them.

INT.  PALACE BALLROOM - NIGHT

A magnificent masquerade ball is in full swirl; the dazzling
light of chandeliers bounces off the gilt ceiling and
sparkles on the jewels of swirling dancers, their numbers
multiplied in the polished mirrors that line the walls.

The King is dancing and laughing with sexy young ladies.
D'Artagnan stands to the side of the ballroom, ever watchful,
ever remote.

As the dancers swirl, each one wearing a distinctive mask in
the garish style favored by the French nobility of the
1600's, we see one particular couple -- a large man, with an
excessively large woman.  They are dancing vigorously, and as
they take a break behind a huge pillar, they lift their masks
enough for us to see that the man is Aramis, and the "woman"
is Porthos.

From the folds of their elaborate costumes they both withdraw
replicas of the iron mask that Phillippe once wore.

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan watches everything.  We
          have to be lucky.

                     ARAMIS
          We will make our own luck tonight...
          if Phillippe holds up.

Aramis peers across the ballroom, to where Athos and
Phillippe mix among the revelers, using thin sticks to hold
broad masks to their faces.  Behind the masks we see their
eyes -- Athos' intense, Phillippe's nervous and darting.

                     ATHOS
          Stay calm, you're doing fine.

Then Phillippe's eyes go strangely still; he sees, for the
first time in his life, his twin brother, the King.

                     PHILLIPPE
          My brother...

Louis dances the minuet, prancing as if he is the center of
the universe; but this bliss is broken when one of the
dancers who swirls by him -- it is Aramis -- lifts the
baroque outer mask he's wearing and reveals an iron mask
beneath.

The King staggers, stopping.  The sight stuns him, confuses
him; he looks around but the wearer of the mask has
disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers.  Louis'
hands dart to his eyes:  are they playing tricks on him?

Seeing his reaction, Phillippe whispers --

                     PHILLIPPE
          He knew.  He knew what they did to
          me.

The YOUNG BEAUTY dancing with Louis notices him falter.

                     YOUNG BEAUTY
          What is wrong, your majesty?

                     LOUIS
          Nothing, I -- continue.

Louis rejoins the dancing... and then sees, on the balcony
above him, a different person -- a huge "woman," Porthos --
who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below.

                     LOUIS
          There!  Do you see it?

                     YOUNG BEAUTY
          See what, Majesty?

Porthos has slipped away from the railing when the King looks
back up; the young beauty sees nothing, and turns back to the
King with a look that questions his sanity.

D'Artagnan notices the King's reaction -- though he did not
see the glimpse of the iron mask -- and is just as baffled as
everyone else when the King turns and staggers away.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty...?

                     LOUIS
          ... tired.  Must... lie down.

The music splatters to an awkward stop; Louis hurries out,
leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom,
with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Carry on, everyone...

The music begins again, and the party goers, not knowing what
else to do, politely continue.

Athos draws Phillippe away from the ballroom, into a side
corridor.

AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO THE BALCONY

Porthos waddles down stairs, and meets Aramis.

                     ARAMIS
          Quick, to the passages.

They hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went.

INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door
of his royal apartment.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty, is there anything -- ?

The King shuts the door in d'Artagnan's face.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The King falls upon his bed, pressing his hands to his head.

INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The three Musketeers and Phillippe move quietly up a stairway
and to the door of a room.  Phillippe whispers...

                     PHILLIPPE
          The room of the King's favorite
          mistress?

                     ATHOS
          She will be at the ball.

INT.  MICHELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The door opens and they move in; it is in fact empty, though
a mess.  They move to the wall, where Aramis, after a little
looking, locates the levers to open the wall/door to the
King's secret passageway.  Aramis enters first, the others
follow.  We half expect Michelle to pop up at any moment, but
the Musketeers enter the passage without incident.

INT.  SECRET PASSAGES - NIGHT

Aramis silently leads the others through the secret passage,
to the portal into the King's bedroom.

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King is lying on the bed; we see him from the POV of
someone approaching him slowly, silently.  When his eyes open
in panic, it is too late... We see Aramis, Athos, Porthos
from the KING'S POV as they swarm him.

                     ARAMIS
          It is Judgment Day.

His fist drops into frame... Louis loses consciousness.

LOUIS' POV

as consciousness returns.  He see Phillippe in Louis'
clothes.  Aramis, Athos and Porthos bow and say...

                     MUSKETEERS
          Your Majesty.

LOUIS, still on his bed, now wears Phillippe's clothes.

                     LOUIS
          Wh-- Wha--

                     ARAMIS
          Don't look so shocked, Phillippe.
          Come, you're going back to prison.

                     LOUIS
          Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --

Now Louis understands everything.  He tries to struggle, but
instantly Porthos shoves a rag into his mouth.

Aramis opens the main door a crack, and sees d'Artagnan has
entered his room down the corridor, through whose open door
he can guard the approaches to the King's rooms.  Aramis
shuts the door again and turns to the others.

                     ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan guards the hallway!  You
          must go back the way we came!

Athos puts his hands on Phillippe's shoulders.

                     ATHOS
          Now, your Majesty.  It is time.

Aramis and Porthos bow again to Phillippe -- now dressed and
looking exactly like the King.  Phillippe's mouth is dry; he
swallows hard, and follows Athos up the hidden stairs.

INT.  MICHELLE'S BEDCHAMBER

Athos and Phillippe move to the door; they stop there, and
Athos adjusts Phillippe's costume one more time.

                     ATHOS
          You know the way.

Phillippe nods, tremendously nervous.

                     ATHOS
          You have your note?

Phillippe pats his pocket, like a boy being sent off to his
first day at school.  He surprises Athos, hugging him.  Then
Phillippe opens the door and walks slowly down the hallway.
Athos stands at the door and watches him go, all alone.
Athos whispers, though Phillippe can't hear...

                     ATHOS
          You have the heart of a king.

Reluctantly, he shuts the door behind Phillippe.

IN THE HALLWAY, FOLLOWING PHILLIPPE

as he conducts himself through the ornate corridor, down the
gilded staircase... and into --

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

Phillippe enters the ballroom, and the reappearance of the
"King" draws new attention.  Everyone in the dazzling
ballroom seems to stop and look straight at Phillippe.

Phillippe freezes.  Stares, everywhere, stares!  For what
seems an eternity, he can't move.

But then he raises his hand and says --

                     PHILLIPPE
          Continue.

As if by magic the music plays, the dancing resumes.
Phillippe moves to the throne and takes his place upon it.
He seems to have made it; people glance -- dancing ladies,
young Musketeers, old advisors -- but no one gives him a
second look.  For a moment, Phillippe feels safe.

And then he sees Michelle, her eyes glassy and riveted upon
him.  She wears her most beautiful gown -- the first one
Louis gave her -- but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily.
Her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged, her hair is mussed;
she is drunk.  She weaves her way to him and curtsies
elaborately.

                     MICHELLE
          My gracious noble lord...

Phillippe's heart is pounding; he looks around for help.  He
can only guess who this woman is.  The advisors have now
noticed her; Claude quickly dispatches orders to keep the
party going along, and waves guards over.

                     PHILLIPPE
          How are you... Michelle?

She doesn't react, so he must have guessed right; but
Phillippe knows nothing of what happened just before the
ball, and he's ambushed by her anger.

                     MICHELLE
          How should I be?  I came to give
          this back to you.

She starts tearing off her dress.  Claude and the guards
reach her; the young Musketeers grabbing her.

                     CLAUDE
          Fret not with this, your Majesty --

But Michelle fights, slapping, clawing -- and when one of the
young Musketeers grabs her from behind, his arm to her
throat, Phillippe jumps up.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Stop!  You're hurting her!

Phillippe's face shows something Louis' never did:
compassion.  He looks into Michelle's eyes.

                     PHILLIPPE
          However I have wronged you I will
          make amends.  Whatever the cost.

Phillippe could not have said anything more unlike Louis;
everyone who heard the remark -- Claude, the guards, and
especially Michelle -- stare at him in frozen amazement.

Phillippe realizes his blunder; they've caught him.

The MUSIC STOPS.  But the attention is not directed at the
throne; all eyes shift to the main doorway, where Anne has
appeared.  She is indescribably beautiful; she wears a bright
gown, her hair is brushed and bejeweled, she radiates the
light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has
discovered, at forty, that she is more stunning than ever.

Her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance
of the King; everyone watches transfixed as she approaches.
Phillippe sees her -- his mother.  He stands on legs that
seem to have no bones.  His mother.

She moves to him, her eyes filling with tears.  When she is
almost to the throne, Phillippe falls to his knees before her
and kisses her hand.

No one can believe it, not from this King.  Yet the moment
strikes them as beautiful, and they applaud happily.

Phillippe and the Queen Mother rise, and guide each other --
depending on each other for support, to a seat, he on the
throne, she on a seat the servants place beside him.

Phillippe gives a wave.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Continue.

The ball continues, the music exuberant.  Michelle wanders
away, like a blind lamb.  Phillippe and his mother sit side
by side, holding hands, their reunion passing in private
between their clasped hands, and glistening in their eyes.

INT.  THE PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Michelle, alone and forgotten, staggers down the corridor
toward the King's rooms; she passes d'Artagnan's open door.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - THE THREE MUSKETEERS

are tidying everything up; they have Louis gagged and trussed
up hand and foot, his eyes flashing hatred.

                     ATHOS
          Don't worry, your Majesty.  We have
          a prison for you, where you can rest
          peacefully.

Porthos drapes Louis over his shoulder, and they move into
the passages.  Just as they close the portal behind them, the
door opens and Michelle wanders in like a zombie.  Suddenly,
d'Artagnan is at her shoulder.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Michelle --

Then he sees the room is empty; he thought Louis was here.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Where is he?

                     MICHELLE
          In... the ballroom.  But he isn't
          the same man.

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

As a minuet ends, Claude raises his glass in a toast.

                     CLAUDE
          To King Louis!  And to Anne, the
          Queen Mother!

The guests applaud and reach for wine glasses; servants
present Phillippe and Anne with champagne, and they sip --

                     GUESTS
          To King Louis, and the Queen Mother!

Everyone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his
glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous
fingers, hitting the floor with a crash.

Dead silence; everyone is looking.  Then Anne drops her glass
too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is
part of the celebration.

As the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe --

                     ANNE
          I retire now.  Wait two waltzes,
          then retire to your room; and spend
          the night in safety.  We have much
          to talk about, and have the rest of
          our lives to do it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Good night, Mother.

                     ANNE
          Good night... my son.

She kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them.
She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR

Anne encounters d'Artagnan.  He stops, so taken by the sight
of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Anne!  You look --

Remembering himself, he bows deeply.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          My Queen...

                     ANNE
          D'Artagnan.

She takes his hand, not caring who is watching.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I have never seen a sight more
          beautiful than you, tonight.

                     ANNE
          We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.

She moves off, toward her room.  D'Artagnan enters the
ballroom.

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan sees "Louis" sitting on the throne.  More baffled
than alarmed, he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          How long has the King been back?

                     GUARD
          Some while, Captain.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          He didn't pass my doorway, I was in
          my room.

                     GUARD
          He must've, Captain, there is no
          other way here.

D'Artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin.

PHILLIPPE

sees d'Artagnan, staring at him... then calling more guards
over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry
away.  Then d'Artagnan moves to Phillippe, and bows.  He
looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Continue.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Sire, we have an emergency -- of
          security.  I must ask you to
          accompany me.

                     PHILLIPPE
          ... The ball... Continue.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I must insist, Sire.

Phillippe stands, and follows d'Artagnan from the ball.

INT.  PASSAGES TO RIVER - NIGHT

Aramis, Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the
secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a
drainage channel leading to the river.

They have stashed a boat there; they plop Louis into it and
climb in themselves.  They row toward the archway that is the
exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the Seine glow
outside, like a beacon of safe escape.

But the steel grate of the archway slams down just before
they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of
the darkness.  A shielded lantern rises and its wick is
turned up, revealing

D'ARTAGNAN

he stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers.  His
eyes are intense, his face in agony.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          My friends.

The only one they can see it d'Artagnan.  They all look at
each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Only we four, the most trusted
          Musketeers, knew about the passages,
          meant to keep the King safe... Your
          Majesty...

Phillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of
shame and failure as he looks at Athos, but still he holds
on, trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Yes...?  Why do you bring me here,
          d'Artagnan?

                     PORTHOS
          The King!  Look!  It's the King!

He means Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Then who is that lying beside you?

Porthos turns and looks at Louis -- then reacts as if he's
totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and
gagged beside him.

                     PORTHOS
          Wh-- ?  Where did he come from?

Athos grabs d'Artagnan's arm.

                     ATHOS
          If you ever loved me -- if you ever
          loved honor, or anything else --
          then stand now, and let it happen.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love
          you, I cannot.

D'Artagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind
Louis' hands, and the gag that has kept him from talking.
Aramis suddenly backhands Louis, knocking him flat on his
back in the boat, and pointing to him -- Louis.

                     ARAMIS
          This man is an impostor.  We caught
          him trying to impersonate the King,
          and were just getting rid of him.

Louis struggles upright.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan, arrest them all!

                     ARAMIS
          Shut up, knave!

Aramis slaps Louis again, and pleads with his eyes that
d'Artagnan accept their ruse.  D'Artagnan is dying inside.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Before I came here, I insisted the
          King come with me.  The real Louis
          would never have let me insist.

Seeing they are about to be arrested, the old Musketeers in
the boat spring into action against their younger
counterparts.  Athos swats one swordsman with an oar; Porthos
seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and
flings the man back into two of his comrades; Aramis grabs
Louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat.

                     ARAMIS
          Pull them back, d'Artagnan.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          You can't do it.

                     ARAMIS
          Pull them back!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Everyone back.

                     ARAMIS
          Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into
          the boat!  Now!

Phillippe obeys.

                     ARAMIS
          Open the gate.

D'Artagnan nods to his men, and they open the iron gate
leading out to the river.

The boat makes for the opening.  Just as it is about to reach
it, Louis forces Aramis' hand.

                     LOUIS
          You will not shed royal blood!

He kicks at the boat and struggles to stand, making the boat
tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around.  Aramis
draws the dagger away from Louis' throat to keep from killing
him, and d'Artagnan makes a grab at Louis and drags him onto
the stone floor of the channel.

The boat is almost through the opening -- and Louis snatches
at his brother, Phillippe.

The current outside the gate is rushing by, and the boat is
already caught in the current; it's pulling away and the
Musketeers can't stop it.  Athos seizes Phillippe's legs and
tries to hold him, but the pressure of the current is great,
and now not only Louis but some of the young Musketeers are
helping hold Phillippe.

Phillippe's legs slip out of Athos' grasp, and the boat
flashes downriver...

Aramis, Porthos and Athos have escaped... but Phillippe is
captured, looking into the hate-filled eyes of his twin
brother Louis.

INT.  SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Louis is angrily climbing through the passageways, back up
into the main floors of the palace, venting his emotions at
d'Artagnan, just behind him; the young Musketeers with
Phillippe, their prisoner, follow along further back.

                     LOUIS
          I want all these passages sealed!
          Another stupid idea of my father's!
          Seal them all, every one!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It shall be done, your Majesty.

                     LOUIS
          Even the bedchamber passages!  Let
          none remain!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Yes, your Majesty.

They reach a doorway, and the King bangs through it, into his
own bedchamber, still spouting anger.

                     LOUIS
          I was told this impostor was dead!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          ... You knew you had a double?

                     LOUIS
          He is my brother.

D'Artagnan is frozen in surprise.  Phillippe and his guards
move into the room; seeing him in full light, wearing Louis'
own clothes, fans Louis' anger; he jumps forward and begins
ripping the royal garments off Phillippe.

D'Artagnan forces himself between Louis and Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I -- I thought he was but... an
          impostor who resembled --

                     LOUIS
          My twin.  Which has kept him alive.
          Until now.

                     ANNE'S VOICE
          No!!

They whirl to see the Queen Mother, who has entered through
the main door.  She hurries to the space between her sons,
hugging Phillippe, then trying to hug Louis.

                     ANNE
          Louis, please -- !

                     LOUIS
          My guards are useless!  Take her
          from me!

He motions to the young Musketeers to restrain her;
reluctantly they grip the arms of the Queen Mother.

                     LOUIS
          What had you to do with this,
          Mother?

                     ANNE
          He is your brother!

                     LOUIS
          He is nothing now.

Louis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young
Musketeers -- but d'Artagnan steps between him and Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty... This man before
          you... He is royal blood, the same
          as you.  To spill it is the one
          thing even you cannot do.  It is
          against the laws of God, and of
          France.

                     LOUIS
          Get out of my way.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Not once have I ever asked anything
          for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive
          this man, this prisoner... your
          brother.

                     LOUIS
          Forgive?!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I
          know what they have done was a
          threat against you -- and yet that
          threat has been removed, with no
          harm coming to your Majesty.  If
          their passions were in error, their
          spirits have ever been noble.
          Forgive them.

                     LOUIS
          They have plotted against me!  Me!
          The embodiment of God's will!

D'Artagnan sinks to his knees before the king.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty... Every day of your
          life, I have watched over you.  No
          angel could have stood a more
          faithful vigil.  I have bled for
          you, and have prayed, every day, to
          see you become greater than your
          office, better than the law.  Show
          me now what my faith and blood have
          purchased.  Show mercy.

The words cut into everyone:  Anne, Phillippe, the young
Musketeers.  But Louis' eyes are cold, as he responds --

                     LOUIS
          You take the side of traitors?

                     PHILLIPPE
          Please, may I speak?  M'lord... I
          beg that you kill me.  I release
          you, before Almighty God, from any
          claim of sin in taking my life.  In
          fact I will pray that God reward you
          for your mercy to do it.  But do not
          -- I beg you -- return me to the
          prison, where I have lived so long.

Phillippe's plea makes Louis pause... then smile.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan, you will hunt down
          Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring
          me their heads, or I will have
          yours.  And as for you, Phillippe...
          Back to the prison you shall go, and
          into the mask you hate.

                     ANNE
          No, Louis!  No!

                     LOUIS
          Wear it until you love it.  And die
          in it!!

Anne screams, and Louis waves to the guards, who draw her
from the room, as d'Artagnan sags, on his knees before the
King he has served so faithfully.

Slowly, Phillippe lowers his head.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM

D'Artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the
bed and drops his face into his hands.

Then he hears the sound, like a SCREAM, but short and
muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog.  He lifts his
head sharply; where did that sound come from?  He is almost
too tired, too sad, to investigate.

Then the King, already shaken by the night's events, hurries
into d'Artagnan's room.

                     LOUIS
          What was that sound?!  Did you hear
          it?  It came from Michelle's room!

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER

D'Artagnan enters, ahead of Louis.  They see nothing unusual,
and d'Artagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward Michelle's
apartment.

MICHELLE'S APARTMENT

D'Artagnan enters the room, and finds it empty -- but the
window is open.  He moves toward it...

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER

The King is pacing as d'Artagnan reappears.

                     LOUIS
          Where is Michelle?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          There.

He points to the window.  Louis shoves open the drapes and
leaps back in horror.  Michelle has hanged herself outside
Louis' window, the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose
around her neck.

INT.  QUEEN MOTHER'S APARTMENTS - DAWN

Anne has changed; she is tormented, but alive with energy,
pacing.  There is a knock at her door, and the old nun opens
it to d'Artagnan.  The old nun leaves them alone; d'Artagnan
moves to Anne and takes her hands, to look into her eyes.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          There were two.  Not one.  But two.

                     ANNE
          I couldn't tell you.  You had enough
          to carry.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Anne... The night we had together...
          I always wanted more.  But that one,
          it was enough.  Enough to make me
          love you forever.  I want you to
          remember that... and go on.  As
          strong as you are now.  No matter
          what happens.

He kisses her.  She drinks in his love.  Then he stands and
moves to the door.  He looks back, then stares out.

                     ANNE
          D'Artagnan -- ?

He looks back once more; he seems to want to tell her
something; but whatever it is, he can't find the words, and
with a last loving look at her, he walks away.

EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE BASTILLE - NIGHT

A sudden visual, establishing the Bastille, the horrific
legendary prison of Paris.

INT.  BASTILLE - NIGHT

Phillippe, his head covered in a burlap hood, is rushed
through the twisting stairways of the prison.

INT.  A CELL, IN THE BOWELS OF THE BASTILLE

The guards remove the hood, and Phillippe sees the cell.
Then he sees the blacksmith there, with a new iron mask, and
his eyes take on a fresh horror.

                     PHILLIPPE
          No.  Please!  No!

The guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over
Phillippe's face, as he screams.  They seal the mask with a
small padlock, whose key is distinctive, and jeweled.

INT.  BASTILLE - LATER

The two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after
completing their work.  Far above them, in the prison tower,
the cries of the prisoner echo; he sounds like a raving
madman now.

The two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base
of the tower; the BASTILLE JAILER looks up.

                     BLACKSMITH
          Pay me quick, I want out of here.

Soldiers, swords drawn, appear in the doorway behind them.

                     GUARDS
          What --

                     BASTILLE JAILER
          You saw the prisoner's face.

Understanding, the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the
soldiers; but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer, and
the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him.  A soldier
lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard.

THE KEY

is handed to the King by Andre, the young Lieutenant.  Louis
hangs the key around his own neck, with a thin gold chain.

                     LOUIS
          Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?

                     LIEUTENANT
          Out directing the search for the
          traitors.

                     LOUIS
          When he returns, watch him.  When he
          leaves again, you tell me.

The Lieutenant bows.  Louis smiles, and fingers the key.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Squads of young Musketeers gallop along the river, and
through the dark streets around it, searching...

ALONG THE BACK WALL OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, three forms
scurry through the darkness:  Aramis, Porthos and Athos,
heaving, wheezing.  They duck into a niche of the wall to
avoid capture from another patrol galloping by.  Then Aramis
unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in.

INT.  CATACOMBS

The three Musketeers struggle through the catacombs, reach
the chapel, and fall gasping to the floor.

                     ARAMIS
          Bloody hell...

                     ATHOS
          We can't... stay here.  That traitor
          d'Artagnan... knows about this
          place.

                     PORTHOS
          Can we eat... before we go?  This
          excitement's given me an appetite.

                     ARAMIS
          Bread and wine... in that cupboard.

Porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of
the lantern.  The rising light reveals a note, stuck to the
cupboard with the blade of a dagger.

                     PORTHOS
          A note.  Pinned with a dagger, like
          the old days.

He removes the note, and reads...

                     PORTHOS
          "Phillippe has been removed to the
          Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At
          midnight tonight I will order the
          guard changed, and will delay the
          replacements for ten minutes.  That
          should give you ample time.  Never
          have I needed more to say:  One for
          all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."

                     ATHOS
          He lures us to capture.

                     ARAMIS
          He seeks redemption.

                     ATHOS
          You're a fool!

                     ARAMIS
          Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am
          certain.  What he did tonight was
          what he told us all along he would
          do -- be faithful to his King.

                     ATHOS
          So what has changed?

                     ARAMIS
          Perhaps he serves a different king.

                     PORTHOS
          What choice is there?  If Phillippe
          is in the Bastille, then to the
          Bastille we will go.

                     ATHOS
          You are right.  But it is a trap.

                     PORTHOS
          So what?  I'd rather die covered in
          blood, than an old man, lying in my
          own piss.

                     ARAMIS
          Then to the Bastille.

                     ATHOS
          To the Bastille.  And death.

EXT.  BASTILLE - NIGHT

The stone walls rising into the Paris night seem to ooze
evil.  The building looks impossible to get into, much less
get out of; its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood,
encased in stone ramparts.

We hear a sharp, echoing KNOCK; Aramis, Athos, and Porthos
stand outside the main entrance, Athos slumped between the
other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail.

No one answers their knock; the three Musketeers exchange
doubtful glance, and Porthos knocks again.  A guard inside
slides open a view port of the massive door.

                     PORTHOS
          Open up!  We have a prisoner!

The port shuts, bolts rattle, and the great door heaves open.
The Musketeers glance at each other again, and play their
roles, Aramis and Porthos dragging Athos inside.

INT.  THE BASTILLE - MAIN COURTYARD - NIGHT

The prison courtyard is murky in the darkness, and ringed by
doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons.

                     GUARD
          Take him down to level three.  The
          Captain will see to the documents.

Aramis and Porthos drag Athos into one of the shadowy portals
surrounding the courtyard.

INT.  BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The three Musketeers duck into the inky shadows; Aramis cuts
the bonds that hold Athos' hands, and gives him the extra
sword he had beneath his cloak.

                     PORTHOS
          It worked!

                     ATHOS
          It's a prison, you idiot!  They
          don't expect anyone to try getting
          in!  The problem will come when we
          want out!

Aramis shushes them, and leads them into another quiet
corridor.  They hear the distant bells of a church, then
suddenly they must scramble, as a platoon of guards carrying
torches troop up stairs into the corridor; the Musketeers
dart like rats into dark nooks; as the guards pass, the
Musketeers huddle, and the bells end their tolling.

                     ARAMIS
          Midnight!  We have ten minutes!

They press on, deeper into the Bastille.

INT.  PALACE - ANNE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Anne moves to the window, where she starts to kneel for her
nightly prayer; but she stops.  Outside in the garden, far
below her window, is d'Artagnan on horseback, waiting.  Their
eyes connect.  He has a single rose in his hand.  Never
taking his eyes from her, he places the rose on the stone
bench of the garden, and reins his horse away.

Then she understands what he was trying to tell her before,
in the hallway; it was goodbye.

EXT.  PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT

D'Artagnan rides away quickly, passing -- without seeing --
Lieutenant Andre, who has been watching him.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Through the night d'Artagnan gallops.  We see his destination
in the distance:  the Bastille.

EXT.  THE PALACE GATES - NIGHT

The great gates of the palace swing slowly open, and out ride
a whole platoon of young Musketeers, surrounding Louis
himself, on horseback and dressed like a soldier.

INT.  THE BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS

The three Musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs,
through another corridor, down another stairway.  They pass
cells; wretched prisoners look up, but none of them is
Phillippe.  Then the Musketeers surprise a JAILER.

                     JAILER
          Hey...!

But before the man can say anything else, Porthos has crushed
him like a bug against the wall.  They rip the huge ring of
keys from the jailer's waist, and take his torch.

PHILLIPPE'S CELL

He lies on the floor; he sees the light of a torch, coming to
him like sunrise... and then he hears a voice --

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe...?

                     PHILLIPPE
          How did you --

They open the door and release him -- from the cell, but not
from the mask.  He tries to hug Athos.

They head back the way they came.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Louis and his platoon of young Musketeers ride through the
streets, scattering the paupers who sleep there.

INT.  BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

Back up the stairs... through one corridor... they start up
the second flight of stairs, then stop and scramble back.

                     ARAMIS
               (whispering)
          Someone's coming!

They take cover on either side of the corridor, and lift
their swords.  It's a man coming down the stairs, with a
hooded lantern... they raise their swords to strike --

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The way is blocked above.  The
          Captain of the Bastille has turned
          back from the mission I sent him on,
          and is in the courtyard with a party
          of men.

                     ATHOS
          He lies.  He is here to trap us.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I came to see you safely out.  Check
          for yourself.

Porthos climbs the stairs to check; D'Artagnan looks at
Phillippe, in the mask.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          All you have suffered, I would
          gladly have borne myself, to keep it
          from you.

Athos spits on the floor, in derision.  But Porthos comes
barreling back down the stairway.

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan is right, the courtyard
          is filling with soldiers!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          This way.

He leads them quickly down a side corridor; the others have
no choice but to follow.

A SIDE CORRIDOR

D'Artagnan leads them around another corner, into a long
corridor; at the end of it is a massive door.  They reach it,
and d'Artagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal
seal of the Musketeers; he begins unlocking the three
padlocks that secure the door.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Once you are through, don't stop
          until you reach the river.

                     ARAMIS
          They will know you helped us, if we
          go this way.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          That doesn't matter now.

They open the door... and as they do they see Louis and his
platoon of young Musketeers arriving outside.

                     LOUIS
          There!  Stop them!

                     ATHOS
          Betrayed!

The young Musketeers serving the King jump from their horses
and grab for the door; but d'Artagnan leaps forward, his
sword flashing.  After a second of surprise, Athos, Aramis
and Porthos jump forward too, and there is a brief, bloody
skirmish at the door.  But the young Musketeers have
overwhelming numbers, and firearms too; protecting Phillippe,
the old Musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling
the door shut and latching it quickly.

                     ARAMIS
          Back the way we came!

They race back up the corridor -- the four Musketeers, and
Phillippe, in the iron mask -- and turn the corner.  They
reach another inner door, pass through it -- and see the
soldiers of the Bastille coming at them.

                     ARAMIS
          Back!

They retreat, and Porthos slams the second door.  Like all
the inner doors of the Bastille, it's heavy wood, a foot
thick, and Porthos seals it with a huger iron bar.  But
there's nowhere else to run.

                     ATHOS
          Trapped.

At the far end of the corridor, the King's young Musketeers
have the same keys to the outer door that d'Artagnan did, and
they are breaking through.  Louis and two dozen of his
personal bodyguard pour through the door.

                     LOUIS
          Charge them!

The young Musketeers obediently charge down the corridor.

Stepping up shoulder to shoulder -- Aramis, d'Artagnan,
Athos, Porthos -- the four veteran Musketeers meet the
charge, first with pistols, then with swords, a wall between
Louis' men and Phillippe.  The battle in the cramped confines
of the corridor is bloody and fierce; the young attackers can
only get a few men into the fight at any one time, and those
who step before the famous veterans are cut down.

Louis' young Musketeers retreat, to regroup.

AT LOUIS' END OF THE CORRIDOR

Louis is furious, jumping at Lieutenant Andre, who has
dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight.

                     LOUIS
          Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!

                     LIEUTENANT
          The corridor nullifies our number...
          And no one has stomach to fight the
          Captain.

Louis is disgusted by this loyalty -- and he has a solution.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan!

AT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR

Louis' voice echoes down to the veteran Musketeers and
Phillippe, in the Iron Mask.

                     LOUIS' VOICE
          I am not angry with you.  I knew you
          would lead me to them, and so you
          have!  Lay down your sword, and I
          will not punish you!  I will let you
          retire in peace -- to live out your
          days in the countryside!  And I will
          give your friends a swift execution,
          if you surrender now.

The words bounce down the long corridor; then silence.
D'Artagnan stands holding his sword, staring away from his
friends, toward the King and his gang of young Musketeers.

                     ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should
          accept his offer, for we are dead
          anyway.

                     PORTHOS
          He is right, d'Artagnan.

Athos says nothing; but when d'Artagnan looks at him, he
lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted d'Artagnan's
loyalty and friendship.

Phillippe speaks up, from behind the Iron Mask.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all
          your lives.  You have done your
          best.  Let me go, and let all of you
          find peace.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No.  Even if I could give up my
          friends, I could never give up my
          son.

This hits them like a bombshell -- and suddenly it all makes
sense; d'Artagnan's loyalty to Louis, his dogged hope that he
could somehow influence him toward goodness.  We see their
stunned faces, each in turn:  Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and
Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I never had any idea you existed...
          until they found you.  And in all
          that time, I never had a moment's
          pride as a father -- until now.

D'Artagnan and Phillippe embrace, lost father to lost son.

From the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful
pounding; the Bastille's soldiers are trying to break it
down.  Time is running out.

Aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the
outside, barred now by Louis and his young guards, their long
muskets bristling like spikes; and yet that way is the only
possible hope for escape to the outside.

                     ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan... Those are young
          Musketeers down there.  They have
          been weaned on our legends.  They
          revere us -- it is an advantage.
          Why don't we charge them?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I trained those men myself.  They
          will stand and fight.  But if we are
          to die, let it be this way.

He draws his sword and points it into the air.  Aramis lifts
the tip of his sword to join that of d'Artagnan.  Porthos
does too... and then Athos joins them.

                     ATHOS
          One for all.  All for one.

                     PHILLIPPE
          If I could have a blade, then I
          would be please to run with you.

D'Artagnan gives Phillippe a dagger.  They look at each
other.  Then d'Artagnan begins to scream.  The others take up
the shout.  Then they step around the corner, and charge.

THE LAST CHARGE OF THE MUSKETEERS

We film it in all its glory, a visual feast:  the Last Charge
of the Musketeers.  Their capes swirl about time, their hair
flies, their legs take on new life.

At first the young Musketeers at the end of the corridor are
frozen in surprise; their youthful Lieutenant is awed by the
dashing, beautiful bravery of the thing.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Magnificent valor...

                     LOUIS
          Shoot them!  Shoot them!

Louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and
fires:  SSSBOOM!  With the first explosion of gunfire the
others pull their triggers; the powder in their weapons
flashes and crashes...

The musket balls fly down the hallway, sparking off the stone
walls and floor, ricocheting, punching holes through the
capes and flesh... but still the Musketeers charge like the
young men they once were -- still are, in spirit.

In the confines of the Bastille's stone corridor the noise is
deafening, and the space in front of the guards is filled
with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder.  None of them can
see anything beyond it... and all is quiet.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Draw blades!

The King's Guards draw their swords, and wait; are all the
old Musketeers dead?

Slowly the figures emerge from the smoke -- in SLOW MOTION,
walking now, no need to run.  All are wounded, but all are
still alive.

The Four Musketeers, along with Phillippe, move slowly and
steadily toward the blades of the young Guards; a fight to
the death?  So be it.

But the young Lieutenant will have none of it; as one of his
men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of d'Artagnan,
the young Lieutenant bats the sword down, with his own.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Stop!

He steps forward toward d'Artagnan; but instead of thrusting
his sword he salutes with it.

His men follow suit, saluting and bowing to the courage of
these men they have grown up wanting to follow.

King Louis, for the moment, is frozen.

D'Artagnan looks back at Phillippe; he has bullet holes in
two different places at the edges of his clothes, but he is
unwounded.

Then d'Artagnan sees Louis, with his long dagger, leaping at
Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          NO!

D'Artagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls
Louis backwards, then spins to Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Phillippe!

                     PHILLIPPE
          I am unhurt --

Louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again, driving
the blade into d'Artagnan's back.

D'Artagnan's face jolts; he staggers, his legs buckle.
D'Artagnan falls into the arms of his friends.

Louis stands holding his bloody dagger, everyone staring at
him:  d'Artagnan, the old Musketeers, the young ones.

                     PHILLIPPE
          You!  Vicious... evil...!

He leaps into Louis, overwhelming him in fury, wrenching the
dagger from his brother's hand and gripping his throat.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Phillippe...!  No... Don't... He is
          your brother!

Phillippe releases Louis, who falls, choking, gasping.
Lieutenant Andre is surprised by what he just heard.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Brother...?

Phillippe darts to d'Artagnan, being cradled by Athos; Athos
lifts a hand from d'Artagnan's back; it is drenched in blood.
D'Artagnan is dying.

Athos, Aramis, Porthos... none of them can speak.  They grip
d'Artagnan, as if through their will alone they could keep
his life from leaking away.  The young Musketeers stand
transfixed, watching their legendary Captain die.  Phillippe
sags; his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief.

                     PHILLIPPE
          All this time... I was a lost
          secret.  But you were hiding all
          your loyalty, all your love.  You
          were the Man in the Iron Mask.

                     ATHOS
          D'Artagnan...

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Shhh.  All my life, this is the
          death I have wanted.  To die among
          you.  One for all... and all for...

He is gone.

Phillippe rises with a slow, terrible resolve, and moves to
Louis.  When Louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the
blade of the young Lieutenant Andre pointed at his chest.

                     LIEUTENANT
          All my life, all I ever wanted to
          be... was him.

He points to d'Artagnan.  Phillippe rips away the key that
dangles around Louis' neck.

                                                  CUT TO:

AT THE OTHER DOOR

where the soldiers of the BASTILLE'S COMMANDER are finally
breaking through; working the massive door aside they find --

THE KING with his guards, and Aramis, Athos, Porthos, along
with their prisoner, in the Iron Mask.

                     LIEUTENANT
          We have recaptured the prisoner.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No, no!  I am your --

A blow in his chest from the Lieutenant stuns the prisoner
and drops him to his knees.  The King orders the BASTILLE
GOVERNOR --

                     KING
          You will put this madman where no
          one can hear his insanity.  Let him
          be fed by a deaf mute.  But feed him
          well, and let him have a long life
          within the Iron Mask.

                     BASTILLE GOVERNOR
          And them?

He means Aramis, Porthos, and Athos.

                     KING
          They are my loyal servants.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No!  No...!

But the guards are dragging him to the deepest, darkest
dungeon of the Bastille.

EXT.  LANE OF ELMS - BESIDE THE PALACE - DAY

At the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's
graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble
monument stone above the final resting place of d'Artagnan.

Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and the King -- Phillippe, known as
King Louis now -- stand gathered there, as Aramis in his
priest's garments utters the funeral incantations.  Aramis'
voice breaks as he does so.  Porthos' eyes pour out rivers of
tears.  Athos' grief is beyond weeping.

Phillippe holds the arm of his mother.  She holds the rose
d'Artagnan left her.

                     ARAMIS
          Amen.

Athos moves up between Aramis and Porthos, and links them
with his arms.

                     ATHOS
          He was the best of us all.

Aramis and Porthos move off together, to walk the lane of
elms; Athos remains by the grave, unable to leave.

Phillippe pats Anne's arm.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I will be with you in a moment,
          Mother.

She too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the
rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face.

Phillippe moves up to Athos.

                     PHILLIPPE
          After all you have done, I must ask
          you one more service to your king.
          I have lost my father.  And you have
          lost your son.  Let me love you like
          a son to a father.  And I pray you
          live for this, to love me like your
          son.

Athos can't speak; he can only nod yes.  Phillippe moves to
join his mother, leaving Athos to take one final look down at
the grave.  Then as Athos moves off to join Aramis and
Porthos, we PAN from the name "D'ARTAGNAN" on the stone, to
the pattern chiseled beneath the name.

It is a mask, of iron.

                                                FADE OUT.

                                           September 18, 1995





FADE IN:

From the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young
woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her
mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name
is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in

A ROYAL BEDCHAMBER

The royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal
mother grips her hands...

On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated
from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are
royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to
their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain
of childbirth.

Her fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her
need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for
the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head,
stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers.

                     DOCTOR
          The head is born!  One arm... the
          other arm... it is a boy!

The advisors, disregarding the Queen's privacy, scurry around
the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet
with birth.  The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony,
yet she struggles to lift her head.

                     ADVISOR 1
          I shall tell the king!

                     ADVISOR 2
          I shall tell him!

They hurry for the door.  But their race to be first to bring
this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits
another cry; it surprises the doctor.

                     DOCTOR
          M'lady...?

He kneels again to examine the Queen.

                     DOCTOR
          Another...?  It is another!

The joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors.  They look
gravely at each other, as they hear a second BABY'S CRY.

                                                SMASH TO:

A DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT

A door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard
and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is
hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his
cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER.

He carries an OBLONG BASKET.

A carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the
courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a
sharp word to the driver --

                     MUSKETEER
          Away.

The whip CRACKS and the carriage plunges into the night.

EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY

On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the
southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison,
like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and
foreboding.  As we SUPERIMPOSE:

                            1662
                   TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER

INT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON

With the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It
is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their
own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive
women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which
prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding
staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of
a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places
we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell.

And we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying,
to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his
eyes... They are blue, childlike.

A greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to
the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty.

                     KEEPER
          You dead yet?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No, Keeper.

EXT.  ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE:

                           PARIS

EXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing
figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the
moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the
cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy
shadows.  He is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily
as if they were racing across an open field and not through a
cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace
and power came not from the animal but from the rider.
Sitting lightly in the saddle is

D'ARTAGNAN

famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.  He
is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in
his courage and his loyalty.

He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the
streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.  When they
see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.  They sail by
d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a
boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding.

OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL

D'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence
beside Notre Dame Cathedral.  Priests are dispensing food to
beggars gathered in the courtyard.  As d'Artagnan reins his
horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at
the royal symbols on his uniform.  But d'Artagnan is not a
man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and
moves toward the doorways the people part for him.

He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old
residence, a big rickety carriage.  D'Artagnan smiles.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Porthos too!

D'Artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the
staircase of the tower above him.

INT.  PRIESTS' RESIDENCE - A STAIRWAY - DAY

Four people are moving up a winding stairway; three are
women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth
is PORTHOS, the former Musketeer, now a nobleman of great
wealth and even greater girth.  He and the women are drinking
wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos
like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  Porthos is not so
drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip
their bodies as they walk and giggle.

                     PORTHOS
          Ah ha!  Here we are!  Aramis!
          Porthos is here!

They reach a doorway.  Porthos kicks it open, staggers back,
and begins shoving the women inside.

INT.  A PRIEST'S APARTMENT - DAY

The first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops
short at what she sees.  The second and third stumble in
after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they
see.  Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in.

                     PORTHOS
          Aaaaaaaramis!!  Porthos is --

He stops dead in his tracks.  From the POV OF PORTHOS AND THE
WOMEN, we see ARAMIS.  Always the most theological of the
Musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and
powerful.  And still handsome, or at least he would be; but
now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar,
wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer.

                     PORTHOS
          Sorry, my dears.  You would have
          enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a
          donkey.

                     WENCH 1
          So are you.

                     PORTHOS
          Really?  I haven't been able to see
          it for fifteen years.  Go on now,
          leave His Holiness alone.  I'll
          bring you back tomorrow when he's in
          a better mood.

He whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to
Aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend.

                     PORTHOS
          Please revel with me, Aramis, I need
          my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm
          weak, my strength is gone --

                     ARAMIS
          Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you
          see I'm praying?

                     PORTHOS
          I just said you're praying!  Are you
          deaf too?  I know you're blind,
          because if you had seen the tits
          that just walked out of here, you'd
          have tears in your eyes.

                     ARAMIS
               (trying to ignore him)
          There are more important things than
          tits.

                     PORTHOS
          Really?  If you can name me one
          thing, one single thing, that is
          more sublime than the feel of a
          plump pink nipple between my lips,
          I will buy you a new cathedral.

Aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait.

                     ARAMIS
          Forgiveness.

                     PORTHOS
          Forgiveness?

As if in reply, Porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart.

                     PORTHOS
               (beat)
          Forgive me.

Aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries
to keep praying.

                     PORTHOS
          Am I forgiven?

Aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend.  Porthos reels
backwards, landing in a chair.

                     PORTHOS
          I observe your forgiveness isn't
          sweeter than a plump nipple.

                     ARAMIS
          Can't you see I'm praying,
          goddammit?!

Porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls.
Aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; Porthos
picks up the whole table -- just as d'Artagnan enters.

                     PORTHOS AND ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan.

Porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'Artagnan.

                     PORTHOS
          How are you, you skinny little pup!

Aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment.

                     ARAMIS
          A simple theological discussion.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Aramis -- the King wishes to see
          you.

                     ARAMIS
          Still you serve him loyally --
          though people hurl rotten eggs at
          his royal emblem.

Aramis lifts d'Artagnan's cloak as evidence:  near its hem,
sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I see your mind is sharp as ever.
          The King said, "Right away."  Cut
          deep and hard, my friends.

                     PORTHOS
          Deep and hard, D'Artagnan.

D'Artagnan clasps Porthos' hand, then that of Aramis, and
leaves, as Porthos shakes his head.

                     PORTHOS
          We were all Musketeers once, eh?  Oh,
          I forgot.  For the poor, the ones
          you were praying for.

He hands a purse to Aramis.  Surprised, even touched, Aramis
reaches for it.  Just as he takes the money, Porthos throws a
haymaker; but Aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks.
Suddenly the two old warriors are circling again.

                     PORTHOS
          I wonder how Athos is doing.

INT.  A SMALL HOUSE - DAY

ATHOS stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed
in a dark plain coat, he too is a former Musketeer -- gray
haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust
of manners masking seas of emotion.  He opens a small wooden
box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's
looking for just as his son RAOUL enters.  RAOUL is in his
mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French
Army.  He is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the
mirror.

                     RAOUL
          Do I look all right?

                     ATHOS
          None of the ladies will be able to
          take their eyes off you.

                     RAOUL
          I care only about Michelle.  Should
          I ask her when we first arrive?
          Or... or when we're leaving?  I
          could ask her in the carriage -- but
          it is more romantic at the palace.
          I get so confused...

                     ATHOS
          Perhaps this will help.

He hands Raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box.

                     RAOUL
          Mother's ring.  I can't take this.

                     ATHOS
          She died giving you to me.  And I
          want to die knowing it is one the
          finger of the women my son loves.

They embrace.  Athos' eyes mist, but he smiles.

                     ATHOS
          Now go, and bring back your fiance.

ESTABLISHING - THE ROYAL PALACE - DAY

The Palace glows golden in the Parisian sunshine.  Carriages
deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens.

EXT.  THE ROYAL PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

Attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire
of Louis XIV's France, the men like peacocks, the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms.  They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the
doorway, through which the king is about to come...

JUST BEYOND THAT PALACE DOORWAY

KING LOUIS the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors.  He is twenty-two, and would be quite
handsome, except for the total self-absorption.  He's
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors, PIERRE and CLAUDE, try to speak with him.

                     PIERRE
          Your Majesty, I know it is a... a
          festive time, but before --

                     KING LOUIS
          The blue sash.  No, the burgundy!

                     PIERRE
          ... before the party begins --

                     KING LOUIS
          The party has already begun -- so
          why are you delaying me?

                     PIERRE
          We do not wish to delay you,
          Majesty, but... as your advisors, we
          feel it is our -- our --

                     CLAUDE
          ... our duty.

                     PIERRE
          Yes!  It is our duty to let you
          know... there are riots in Paris.

                     LOUIS
          Riots?  My people live in the
          world's most beautiful city, their
          king has the grandest palaces on
          earth.  Why should they feel
          anything but pride and contentment?

                     PIERRE
          Well yes, of course, Majesty, and
          I'm sure they are content... except
          that... well, they are starving.

                     LOUIS
          Sometimes the poor do grow hungry.
          But why would they riot about it?

As he says this, a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs.

                     PIERRE
          Majesty... We have more than enough
          food set aside for your birthday
          celebration next week.  If we
          distributed some of that, we would
          have time to gather more before --

                     LOUIS
          Aramis!  I have been expecting you!
               (to the tailors)
          We are satisfied, that will do.

The tailors and advisors withdraw as Aramis -- still in his
simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind.

                     ARAMIS
          Your birthday celebration, your
          Majesty?

                     LOUIS
          Next week.  This is a mere garden
          party -- and I wish to join it, so I
          will be brief.  I am experiencing
          resistance from the Jesuits.

                     ARAMIS
          Well... perhaps you should speak
          with them, your Majesty.

                     LOUIS
          I have demanded it -- and common
          priests present themselves!  Can you
          imagine the arrogance?  Common
          Jesuit priests try to act as my
          equals, and they refuse to reveal
          the names of anyone else in their
          order!  No one can keep secrets like
          the Jesuits can, and the identity of
          their leader is the darkest secret
          they hold.  Even the Pope himself
          does not know who leads the Jesuit
          Order in France!  He suspects the
          Governor General of Jesuits, whoever
          he is, is angling to become Pope
          himself.

                     ARAMIS
          How can I serve you in this?

                     LOUIS
          Perhaps you can find out who this
          secret leader of the Jesuits is.
          You are now a priest, but you were
          once a Musketeer, serving the throne
          of France, a throne ordained of God.
          Can you accept this mission, and
          keep it private?

                     ARAMIS
          If I find out the identity of this
          Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him
          and the man who told me.

                     LOUIS
          Once a Musketeer, always a
          Musketeer, eh?

Aramis bows and Louis turns back to his mirror.  There are
mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his
reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric
from the sun.  Aramis leaves and the advisors return.

                     LOUIS
          Ah yes, the riots.  We have food
          stocks on the wharves right now, no?

                     PIERRE
          That food has spoiled.  That is why
          it was not shipped to the army.

                     LOUIS
          Exactly why it should be given away.

                     PIERRE
          What... an excellent idea, your
          Majesty!

EXT.  PALACE GARDENS - DAY

Among the guests are Raoul and MICHELLE, a stunningly
beautiful young woman.  Michelle is awed by the richness all
around them, while Raoul sees only her.  He holds the ring.

                     MICHELLE
          Isn't it glorious!

                     RAOUL
          Michelle...

But just as he starts to speak, trumpets blast and the King
steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens; the
party goers give him a rousing ovation.  Raoul returns the
ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment.

Everyone watches the King, who begins guzzling wine and
telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the King's
witticisms.  Then Louis catches sight of Raoul and Michelle,
and lowers his voice, to his FRIENDS...

                     LOUIS
          Who is that?

                     FRIEND 1
          Raoul, son of Athos.

                     LOUIS
          Not the soldier, you idiot!

                     FRIEND 2
          Her name is Michelle.

The king is transfixed.

D'ARTAGNAN

is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young Musketeers,
directing them to their positions around the gardens, like
secret service agents protecting a president.  He leaves
them, and quickly moves to the King.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty...

                     LOUIS
          What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins
          falling from the sky now?

The sycophants laugh loudly.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The plans for use of the maze were
          not disclosed to me.

                     LOUIS
          I decided it this morning.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Then you must allow me to stay close
          to you so that --

                     LOUIS
          I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will
          change my mind as I wish, and I will
          enjoy my banquet as I wish!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          But I deployed the Royal Guards
          according to your previous --

                     LOUIS
          Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let
          us pretend I am King and you are
          Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us
          behave as if my wish is law.  And my
          wish is to enjoy this party!

D'Artagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle.
D'Artagnan retreats, then looks back to Louis and follows his
gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye.
D'Artagnan recognizes Raoul, son of his friend Athos.

RAOUL AND MICHELLE

As the guests mix and mingle, Raoul tries again.

                     RAOUL
          Michelle, I... Ever since I returned
          I've been wanting to speak with you
          about... about --

A gaunt SERVANT interrupts, presenting a tray of delicacies.

                     SERVANT
          Monsieur, Mademoiselle...?

                     RAOUL
          No!  Thank you -- Michelle, I --

They are interrupted by the SQUEAL of a piglet, squirming in
the hands of the king's dwarf, who holds the fat little
animal above his head and runs among the startled guests.

                     LOUIS
          It pleases us to announce an
          entertainment for our guests!  A
          contest of agility and cunning!

He takes the pig from his dwarf; the pig is clean and
perfumed, a colorful fake horn tied onto its head.

                     LOUIS
          Behold our unicorn!  Whichever of
          our guests captures the unicorn
          shall win its treasure!

With this announcement the King produces a diamond the size
of a pecan, suspended from a ribbon; the guests gasp at its
richness.  The King ties the diamond around the pig's neck.

RAOUL AND MICHELLE

Michelle is amazed at this.

                     MICHELLE
          I have never seen a diamond so
          large!

It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in
his hand.

                     LOUIS
          Into the maze!  All of you!
          Disperse, I command you!

The dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break
in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding
the first laughing lunges of the guests.

THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle
of confusion.  LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of
the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.  From his perch he
looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement.

                     LOUIS
          Are you men or mice?!

MICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for
it.  He almost has the pig... then it kicks free.

                     RAOUL
          The pendant will be yours!

With that he races after the pig.

MICHELLE tries to follow, this way, that way, through the
maze.  Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering
through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners.

                     LOUIS
          Michelle, isn't it?

Speechless, she nods.

                     LOUIS
          I would have said it was impossible,
          but I believe the excitement of the
          chase has made you even more
          beautiful.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire, I --

                     LOUIS
          You blush!  You do not wish to be
          beautiful to your King?

Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening.

FROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis
tries to seduce the young woman.  Even as d'Artagnan watches,
the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement
d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the
sureness of the farm boy he once was.  The pig is quiet and
comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands.

D'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she
allows him to touch her cheek.  The king leans to kiss her...
Michelle does not move...

WHHEEEKKKK!  The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground
running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing.

The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the
pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away.

                     LOUIS
          Wait!  Michelle, I --

Too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him,
leaping down onto him from the observation platform.  It is
the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he
has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is
diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat.

The king is helpless, frozen.  The assassin leaps, falling
toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan,
springing through the gate to save his king.

Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops,
mortally wounded.  They stare down at him now; the would-be
assassin gurgles words through his agony...

                     ASSASSIN
          Feed... your... people.

Party guests, having heard Michelle scream, are running in to
find them.  Michelle rushes off, to find Raoul; several
people are coming up.

                     ASSASSIN
          Your people starve...!  Feed --

The king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the
throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words.  The
king looks at his stunned subjects.

                     LOUIS
          A pitiful madman, nothing more.
          Come, let us continue our chase!
          Where is our unicorn?

The King prances away.  It takes the guests a moment, but
they know that only gaiety will please their King, and off
they go again, laughing as if nothing happened.

D'Artagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his
command come rushing up with swords drawn.

                     YOUNG MUSKETEER
          Captain!

Seeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration.

                     YOUNG MUSKETEER
          You are the best --

D'Artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the King
he turns quickly and walks away.

INT.  FORTRESS PRISON

The Man in the Iron Mask sits on the floor.  A key rattles in
the lock and his keeper shuffles in, carrying food.

                     KEEPER
          Food, moron.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Thank you, Keeper.

Not watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on
something and stumbles, dropping the food.  The prisoner
jumps to his feet, concerned.

                     KEEPER
          Look what you've done!

He picks up the tray and slings it at the prisoner.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I'm sorry, Keeper...

The keeper looks for what he tripped on -- a worn Bible.  He
snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No, Keeper, it's my only book!

Hearing the pleading in the prisoner's voice, the keeper
looks squarely at him -- and rips out the pages.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What number did you tear out?

                     KEEPER
          Eh?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What number, on the first page?

                     KEEPER
          ... Two-thirty-seven.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the
          descendants of Japeth are these:
          Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."

As the prisoner rattles off the names of Biblical genealogy,
the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand.

                     KEEPER
          You've... memorized...?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What was the end page?

As the keeper is speechless, the prisoner looks for himself.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Six-two-one:  "... Though I speak
          with the tongues of men and angels,
          and have not love, I am but a
          clanging cymbal or --"

The Keeper staggers in shock; the prisoner bubbles with joy.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          We're playing, Keeper!  A game!
          Take another page, any page!  Keeper
          and I are playing a game!

And the prisoner takes the keeper's fat hands in his own and
begins to dance and sing.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          A game, a game, we're playing a --

The keeper's left arm goes rigid, and he clutches his chest
with his right hand; he drops upon the stone floor.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Keeper...?

The prisoner approaches the jailer; the man is stoned dead.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No... No!  Keeper, please, you
          cannot die!  You're my only friend!

The prisoner tries to wipe his eyes, but he can't get at
them, inside the mask.  He edges to the open door.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Help!  Someone!  Keeper is dead!

He slumps down beside the open door, and weeps.

INT.  PALACE - D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - EVENING

D'Artagnan's room is spartan:  a cot, and weapons laid on a
plain table.  It has a single small window, and d'Artagnan
stands at it now, looking out into the Palace garden below.

The guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been
cleared away.  And now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady
walks.  She is Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, the lady we
saw in the opening.

Now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure.  Her
clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she
walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants.

She glances up, and sees d'Artagnan's form in the window.
When he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window.

INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - EVENING

D'Artagnan's room is along the same corridor as the Royal
Apartments.  D'Artagnan sits at the small table, going over
paperwork.  Through his open door he sees that Anne and her
attendants are filing along in the corridor, and he rivets
his eyes back to his work.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Anne reaches the door to her apartment, and looks back to
where d'Artagnan's door is open.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM

The Queen Mother's ATTENDANT appears at d'Artagnan's door.

                     ATTENDANT
          She wishes a word with you.

INT.  THE CORRIDOR

D'Artagnan approaches the Queen Mother, and bows.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          M'lady...?

                     ANNE
          I understand you saved my son's life
          today.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          God smiled upon us.

                     ANNE
          And you were not hurt?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No, M'lady.

                     ANNE
          That is good.

Without a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad
face, she enters her room.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - EVENING

D'Artagnan returns to his room, just as a young LIEUTENANT of
Musketeers (Andre) arrives with two of the Royal Guards.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Duty lists of the day, Captain!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Thank you, Andre.

They hand him the list and salute again, to leave.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Wait.  There is an entry here --
          "Messenger sent by King to residence
          of Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort."
          Why was that?

The young Musketeers try not to smirk.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Well, Captain...

INT.  ATHOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Athos sits alone, playing a haunting melody on a violin.  It
is a sad tune, played with feeling; he stops as he hears a
KNOCK at his door, and opens it to --

                     ATHOS
          D'Artagnan!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos, my friend!

They embrace with deep affection -- friends who have shared
each other's darkest times.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It's been too long.

                     ATHOS
          Life is too long.  Except when we
          have our friends.  Look at you!
          You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll
          open a bottle of wine.

D'Artagnan takes one of the wooden chairs, by the meager
fire.  The whole place is modest at best.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Thanks, but not for me.

                     ATHOS
          You can't drink with a friend you
          haven't seen in months?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I have ordered a drill of the Royal
          Guard for midnight, and must be
          clear-headed for it.

                     ATHOS
          Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the
          youngsters hard, eh?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          They must stay sharp.  There was an
          attempt on the King's life today.

                     ATHOS
          Another?  How many times have you
          saved his life in this year alone?
          Three?  Four?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I heard your playing.

                     ATHOS
          I was feeling sorry for myself.
          Raoul is getting married, he
          proposed today!  I love that boy
          beyond all measure, I've spent
          everything I own to give him
          education and opportunity.  Now he
          has complete happiness, and I mope.

A cloud passes d'Artagnan's face; he has something to tell
Athos.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos...

But whatever it is that d'Artagnan wants to say is
interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs.  As
Athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'Artagnan, now it
glows as he jumps up to welcome his son.

                     ATHOS
          That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look,
          d'Artagnan's come to visit...!
          What's wrong?  You look awful!

                     RAOUL
          Michelle, she -- The king has
          invited her to come live in the
          palace.

Athos is stunned; d'Artagnan witnesses this with agony.

                     ATHOS
          But -- are you sure?

                     RAOUL
          We were at her door.  I was just
          taking the ring from my pocket, for
          the third time today, when a young
          Musketeer brought the invitation for
          her to become a lady-in-waiting for
          the Queen Mother.

                     ATHOS
          Michelle cannot possibly accept!

                     RAOUL
          She cannot possibly refuse.  Her
          family is poor, they have even less
          money than we do.  And along with
          the invitation, the King sent the
          diamond pendant, from the piglet.

                     ATHOS
          Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?

                     RAOUL
          Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter
          now.  She loved me once.  I want to
          die remembering that.

                     ATHOS
          Die?  What...?

                     RAOUL
          I have rejoined the army, and asked
          to resume my commission at the head
          of the troops of General Fromberge.

                     ATHOS
          Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.

                     RAOUL
          It is already done.  I have just
          stopped at Mother's grave, to say
          goodbye, before coming to tell you.

                     ATHOS
          Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No
          matter how your heart is broken --

But Raoul stops him, with an embrace.

                     RAOUL
          Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.

                     ATHOS
          Raoul --

Raoul breaks away, and runs from the room.  Athos, so joyful
moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt.

                     ATHOS
          This cannot be.  Everyone knows the
          Queen Mother is a recluse, and the
          ladies-in-waiting are but
          mistresses for the king!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          If the young woman truly loves
          Raoul --

                     ATHOS
          She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a
          poor family.  You may still be young
          enough to believe love conquers
          everything, but I am old and hard
          and I've seen too much.  Even when
          kings are hunchbacks they have any
          woman they desire, because power
          seduces even more than love!

D'Artagnan is silent, and even ashamed.  Athos realizes --

                     ATHOS
          You knew this was happening.  You
          knew and that's why you came.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I fear I know our King.  I came to
          try to bring you hope.

                     ATHOS
          What hope is there?  A wartime
          commission cannot be vacated except
          by the king, and what chance is
          there of that?  Fromberge is on the
          battle line, and Raoul --

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I have dispatches a message to
          Fromberge requesting that Raoul be
          kept far from the fighting.

                     ATHOS
          Raoul is everything to me.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I know.

                     ATHOS
          Oh my friend.

Athos grips d'Artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I will also speak with the King, for
          he is surely unaware of the problems
          his invitation to Mademoiselle
          Beaufort has caused.

                     ATHOS
          You trust his character more than
          anyone else does.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I
          must hurry too.

                     ATHOS
          Save my son, d'Artagnan.

They embrace once more, and d'Artagnan leaves.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - DAY

Magnificent public buildings -- palaces and cathedrals --
grace the city's skyline, but here in central Paris all is
squalor.  On a narrow, filthy street, beggars bother the
sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves.

But interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon,
and one of them, Lieutenant Andre, announces --

                     LIEUTENANT
          Here is food, the gift of your
          loving King, on his birthday!  He
          gives to himself by giving to you,
          in that he loves you so much!

Slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward.  As
the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs -- bread, cabbages,
tomatoes, eggs -- those nearest the wagon begin to jostle
each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly.

                     LIEUTENANT
          No need to fight, there is plenty
          for all!

It's looking like a holiday celebration... until a RUFFIAN
breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose.

                     RUFFIAN
          This stuff stinks.  It is rotting!
          The King gives us rotten food!

He hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers.  Other paupers
sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger:
they throw food at the soldiers... Then a paving stone
crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with
the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the
streets in the direction of the palace.

D'ARTAGNAN, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner
and sees the mob coming.  And they see him:  the elegant,
dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion.

And at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side
street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction.
D'Artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second
pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic.

                     PANICKED SOLDIER
          Back, toward the palace!  We cannot
          hold them off!  We will fire a
          volley into them!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No!  Run to the palace and close the
          gates.  But do not fire!

The two new soldiers race away; d'Artagnan waits calmly on
his horse, as the mobs from both directions converge on him.

THE MOB, seeing the dashing Musketeer wait so confidently for
them, slow up; but the ruffian urges them on.

                     RUFFIAN
          Come on!  To the palace!

D'Artagnan sits calmly in their way.  He doesn't even draw
his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his
horse.  Some of the mob recognize him, and murmur...

                     MOB
          It's d'Artagnan!  Le Generale de
          Musketeers!

The mob hesitates -- for the name d'Artagnan means heroism
and patriotism to all of them.

                     RUFFIAN
          One Musketeer can't stop us!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Stop you?  You are Frenchmen, are
          you not?  I am one of you.

                     RUFFIAN
          The King is a Frenchman, but he is
          not one of us!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Citizens of Paris!  Give ear to me!

                     RUFFIAN
          We'll give you their ears!

With that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it
to the ear of the young Lieutenant who is already bloody from
being dragged through the street.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Wait -- and listen!  I beg you!

                     RIOTER
          They give us garbage, not fit for
          rats!  They think we are garbage!

With that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at
d'Artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement,
he cuts the vegetable from the air.

The display of expertise is startling.  Someone else throws a
head of lettuce; d'Artagnan slices it in half, and as the
pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I'm on my way to a salad!  Doesn't
          anybody have any endive?

The mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of
swordsmanship that lies behind it.  Someone tosses more
lettuce, and d'Artagnan divides and skewers this one as well.
This time the crowd applauds.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          A tomato?

Can he do it?  Someone fires a tomato right at his head, and
sure enough d'Artagnan spears it.  Then, with a victorious
flourish, he takes a bite of it.  His face contorts with the
taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          You are right.  It is rotten.  I
          will speak to the King myself.  You
          have my word.

The mob is completely won over by d'Artagnan; the ruffian,
angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over
the soldiers, but now the point of d'Artagnan's sword flicks
to the ruffian's neck.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          And you will release those men --
          for they serve France... and you.

                     RIOTERS
          Three cheers for d'Artagnan!
          Hurrah...!!  Hurrah...!!

The soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart
now stand and look at d'Artagnan in gratitude and awe.  The
mob has forgotten them; they see only d'Artagnan as he rakes
his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse
around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back
toward the palace.

INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

D'Artagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal
apartments.  As he reaches the door to the king's rooms, he
finds a knot of royal advisors -- among them Pierre and
Claude -- gathered outside the king's door.

                     CLAUDE
          We already know about the riots!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Does he know?

                     PIERRE
          We will tell him, when it is...

                     CLAUDE
          Convenient.

Blocked by the advisors, d'Artagnan leaves them, turning down
one hallway, and then another; he reaches the Hall of Mirrors
and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner; the
mirror becomes a door, revealing a secret passage within the
walls.  D'Artagnan steps through and the portal closes again,
leaving no trace of its existence.

INT.  PALACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Within a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen
foot ceiling, the king is making love; the YOUNG WOMAN lying
beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere.

                     YOUNG WOMAN
          Oh yes!  So good!  Ooo, wonderful,
          Marvelous!  Fan-tas --

Louis climaxes with a grunt.  She tries to sound pleased.

                     YOUNG WOMAN
          Oh, Louis, that was incredible.  It
          was better than ever before.  It --

                     LOUIS
          I'm hungry.

He hops up, throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold.

                     YOUNG WOMAN
          I will have food brought.

                     LOUIS
          I like to eat alone.

He moves to what appears to be a wardrobe, standing against
the far wall, and opens its door, revealing a secret
staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace.

                     LOUIS
          By the way, you'll be moving
          tomorrow.

Leaving the girl without another word, he moves down the
concealed stairs.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

Louis reaches the bottom of the stairs, disguised behind a
similar wardrobe in his own bedroom.  He steps out -- and is
startled as the lifesize portrait of Louis XIII on the other
side of the room opens to admit d'Artagnan.

                     LOUIS
          Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages
          were constructed for the King's
          security, not so you could step from
          my father's portrait and startle me
          to death!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It is for your security that I have
          come, your Majesty -- for the
          security of your honor.

                     LOUIS
          I already know about the riots,
          d'Artagnan, I heard them out there
          whispering.  Some fool gave the
          order to distribute rotten food.  I
          will deal with it tomorrow.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Then there is one more thing, of an
          even more personal nature.

                     LOUIS
          A personal nature?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She
          is betrothed to Raoul, the son of
          Athos the Musketeer, who has served
          France through many tribulations.

The King begins to eat from the food laid out on the table.

                     LOUIS
          Betrothed?  I think not.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          In his mind, anyway, and soon enough
          in hers.  She had written him many
          letters of love.

The King pokes at his food.

                     LOUIS
          Miss Beaufort has accepted our
          invitation.  By this we can only
          suppose that she wishes to come --
          as we wish her to be here.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty has had many women --

                     LOUIS
          That is my desire, and my desire is
          what should concern you, not the
          sentiments of some commoner!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It is not Raoul's heart alone that
          concerns me.  It is yours.  I know
          you find women compliant --
          especially the poorer ones like
          Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do
          you love them?  What about a queen
          to love?  A son of your own?

                     LOUIS
          What quaint notions, d'Artagnan!
          But they contradict my father, who
          picked his queen when he was old,
          and only then to bear me.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          There is more to love than he knew,
          or that you know.

                     LOUIS
          You dare criticize my father?!  Or
          lecture me?!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love
          your people, and you will not bear
          to see them hungry.  Love women, and
          they will love you.  Love yourself,
          and --

                     LOUIS
          That is enough!  You are a good
          servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget
          your place!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          At least help Raoul.

                     LOUIS
          Silence!  I order you!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Order Fromberge to keep him in
          safety!  It is the least you can do,
          to protect your own honor!

                     LOUIS
          I will consider it.  Now leave me.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Thank you, your Majesty.

D'Artagnan bows, steps to the lifesize portrait of Louis
XIII, touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the
secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE ON PIERRE'S FACE...

He is sweating, exceptionally pale, as he tries to project
his voice past a huge lump in his throat...

                     PIERRE
          ... And I only say that... the
          rotten food was... all my fault...
          and I take... full responsibility...
          and beg the forgiveness of you all.

He steps back, having accomplished something terrifically
difficult, and glances toward

THE KING

who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand, whispering
quietly...

                     LOUIS
          Well done, Pierre.  It will be good
          for your soul, that you have taken
          responsibility for your errors.  And
          don't worry, I will look after your
          family.

Pierre can only nod... He takes two steps, kneels, crosses
himself, and places his head between two upright rails of

THE GUILLOTINE

The King, Pierre, and other attendants are standing on a
platform before a crowd of Parisians.  The blade drops,
Pierre's head hits the basket, the crowd cheers.

The King raises his hands to quiet the crowd.

                     LOUIS
          Do not rejoice -- but know that your
          King does not tolerate blunders that
          hurt his beloved people.  More food
          is on its way, and my advisors tell
          me the new harvests are sure to be
          bountiful!

He shoots a glance at his advisors, and they are pale from
the display they've just witnessed.

                     LOUIS
          And I have new joys to announce to
          you!  Today we decree a fresh glory
          for Paris, and for all of France!
          The laying of the foundations to
          expand Versailles, and make it truly
          a palace of the sun!

The advisors all applaud furiously, but from the crowd there
is almost no reaction at all; the triple ranks of soldiers
surrounding the square discourage any protest, and as the
King leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away.

NEAR THE PLATFORM

Aramis, watching the crowd disperse, hears behind him --

                     VOICE
          Aramis.

Aramis turns to see the King, who moves up alone.

                     ARAMIS
          Your Majesty...

                     LOUIS
          How goes that favor I asked of you?

                     ARAMIS
          I grow closer to my target, your
          Majesty.

                     LOUIS
          You bring me the heart of the Jesuit
          General, and you will have a palace
          of your own.

The King moves away, followed by his fawning advisors.

INT.  THE FAVORITE MISTRESS' PALACE ROOMS - DAY

A young Musketeer ushers Michelle into the palace bedroom
previously occupied by the King's last mistress.  The
Musketeer leaves her alone, frozen in the center of the room,
awed by the opulence.  Her eyes play over the details:

-- The handcarved, richly upholstered furniture, beneath her
   fingertips...

-- The carved figures of cherubic angels, gleaming with gold,
   upon the posts of the bed...

-- The murals on the walls and ceiling...

Her reverie is interrupted by a HANDMAIDEN who bustles in
carrying a magnificent dress.

                     HANDMAIDEN
          After your bath put on this, it is
          the King's favorite color.  That
          letter on the desk came here for you
          this morning.

She tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone.  Left alone,
Michelle lifts the letter, and recognizes the writing.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul!

She opens the letter and reads quickly.

                     MICHELLE
          The army!  Oh Raoul, don't despair!
          I will always be faithful...

She interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous
dress.  She looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment,
and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed.

They depict naked gods and goddesses, in Olympian orgies.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE - STEAMING WATER, POURED INTO A TUB

The Handmaiden has prepared a 17th Century bathtub for
Michelle, and now retires.

                     HANDMAIDEN
          If you need me further, just ring.

As the handmaiden leaves, exiting frame, we PUSH IN on one of
the murals on the wall.  The eye of one of the figures there
is no longer the painted eye it was before, but is a real
human eye, disguised by the mural...

THE KING, IN THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY

is spying on Michelle.

THE KING'S POV

as Michelle undresses and steps into the bath.  Louis catches
tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy
water, and it stokes his desire.

INT.  PALACE - MICHELLE'S NEW ROOM - DAY

Michelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself,
breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress.  She stares for a
long time, surprised at her own beauty.

She reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it
around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance.  She
looks into the mirror, at her eyes... In guilt for what she
is already feeling, she lifts Raoul's letter to read it
again.  Then she gasps -- the King stands right before her.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire!  I -- How did you --

                     LOUIS
          How did I get in?  You're new here,
          and will soon learn many secrets.
          What is that?

                     MICHELLE
          ... Nothing.

                     LOUIS
          A letter.  May I see?

He takes the letter; she has no resistance against him.  The
King reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles.

                     LOUIS
          From Raoul.  He urges you to guard
          your honor -- as if it could be in
          any danger... from your king.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul... is in love...

                     LOUIS
          Enough of this, our dinner waits.

Tossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm.  She takes
it and allows him to escort her from the room.

INT.  PALACE - THE HALL OF MIRRORS

The hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames
surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections.
Musicians line the length of the hall, and when Louis and
Michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the
couple as they parade past.  Michelle is speechless, as Louis
smiles at her awed innocence.

INT.  ROYAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Louis leads Michelle into a towering room surrounding a
magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous
delicacies -- set for just two.

THE DINNER

Louis and Michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a
dozen servants.  Michelle stares at her plate.

                     LOUIS
          The food doesn't please you?

                     MICHELLE
          It's lovely.  It's just...

                     LOUIS
          This is more than you are used to.
          Your mother is a seamstress, your
          father is dead.  You have three
          younger sisters, two of whom suffer
          from consumption.  Don't look so
          surprised, Kings know such things.

                     MICHELLE
          I... we are humble people...

                     LOUIS
          Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The
          straits of your family need not be
          permanent.  It is a simple matter to
          have them brought to one of my
          country estates, where they may have
          fine meals, and physicians to look
          after them.

                     MICHELLE
          You would do that, your Majesty?

                     LOUIS
          My dear, I've already done it.

She rushes to him and throws herself at his knees, weeping in
gratitude.  Louis smiles, as if embarrassed.

                     LOUIS
          Please, darling, that isn't
          necessary.  We are friends now.
          Mademoiselle needs wine!

A servant quickly approaches with wine; the goblet at
Michelle's place is quite large, and he pours it full.

INT.  MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Louis leads Michelle back to her room; she's a bit unsteady
from the wine; but she grows alert as she notices him closing
the door behind her.  He stares into her eyes.

                     LOUIS
          You are beautiful.  You know you
          are.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire, I --

                     LOUIS
          If you don't want to be so
          appealing, why did you touch the
          rose to your skin?  Where was it?
          Here?

He touches his lips to her throat.  She gasps, but then pulls
away.  She glances at the letter on the writing table.

                     LOUIS
          What is it?  Raoul?  If he really
          loved you, he would have proposed
          marriage.  He didn't, did he?

He sees her hesitation and uncertainty.  He's smooth, gentle.

                     LOUIS
          You have never known love until you
          have known the love of a king.

He kisses her; for a moment she seems frozen... and then she
yields.  Never having doubted that she would.  Louis pulls
the gown from her shoulders.  She doesn't resist.

INT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON

The old Jailer, carrying a torch that barely pushes back the
darkness, leads another guard up the winding stairs.

                     JAILER
          It's a jolt at first, so brace
          yourself.

INT.  CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK

The Man in the Iron Mask lifts his head as a key rattles into
his door.  The door opens, admitting his old Jailer, and a
NEW KEEPER.  The New Keeper is just a younger version of the
old one -- greasy, fat, and cruel.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Ugh!  He looks 'orrible.

The Man in the Iron Mask rises and takes a step forward; the
new keeper recoils and raises his club threateningly.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Stay back!

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I frighten you.  It's okay.  Keeper
          was scared of me too, at first.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Scared?

The New Keeper steps forward and clubs the Man in the Iron
Mask in the shoulder, then kicks him as he falls.

                     NEW KEEPER
          Scared of you?  Not me.  I'll kill
          him if he gets near me.

The New Keeper strides out.  The Man in the Iron Mask pulls
himself to his knees; his eyes, visible through the slits of
the mask, look sadly at the old Jailer.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I miss Keeper.  I miss him so much.

                     JAILER
          Moron.

The jailer leaves the cell, locking the door behind him.

INT.  A BATTLEFIELD COMMAND TENT

Raoul has just received orders from General Fromberge, who
sits at a map table, Raoul salutes and follows a young staff
officer from the tent.  As Raoul leaves, the General
withdraws from his leather field pouch a royal letter --
parchment, with blue and gold seals.  Fromberge touches the
edge of the parchment to the candle, and burns the letter...

EXT.  TRENCH - DARKNESS

Two men move along a deep trench, the siege works of 17th
century siege warfare.  One of the men is Raoul, carrying a
musket; in his new uniform he looks out of place among the
dirty, battle weary men they pass.  He is following the STAFF
OFFICER who is no older than himself, but whose eyes are
already dead, while Raoul's are wide and wild.

The trench is deep as a grave; by crouching, both men keep
their heads below the surrounding ground.  Thick smoke rolls
over their heads; we can't tell if it is day or night.  From
all around come sounds of battle, with the sporadic fire of
muskets and the rumble of cannons; officers shout orders in
the distance; wounded men nearby whimper for water and the
officer leads Raoul by them as if they did not exist.

The young Staff Officer stops at a bend in the trench.

                     STAFF OFFICER
          Here.

Without another word he goes back the way he came.  Raoul
grips his musket and looks around him; he finds himself among
several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the
trench.  He has little time to wonder what will happen next.
A horn trumpets close by, and with a shout, the French
soldiers clamber out of their breastworks.

For an instant, Raoul hesitates in pure terror, then joins
the charge with a shout of his own --

                     RAOUL
          Mi-cheeelllll!! --

On the stone wall looming above the French soldiers, orange
blossoms of fire -- the muzzle flash of primitive cannons --
penetrate the smoke, and the ground at Raoul's feet explodes,
hurling him backwards.  He covered barely a few feet, and
falls almost exactly where he started.

Dead.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE - THE DOOR OF ATHOS' ROOMS - DAY

A gloved hand raps on the door.  Athos opens it to a military
messenger, who shoves at him a single sheet of paper, rolled
and tied with ribbon.

INT.  ATHOS' ROOM - NIGHT

The message slams onto the table as Athos staggers upon it,
his legs buckling beneath him in shock and grief.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - DAY

D'Artagnan is working at his desk, as the Lieutenant enters.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Sir... a casualty report came...

D'Artagnan looks at the paper the Lieutenant hands him.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No, no, no...

He sags for a moment, then grabs his cloak and sword.

INT./ EXT.  MUSKETEER'S GATE OF THE PALACE - DAY

The Musketeer's Gate is close to the stables where the
Musketeers train and keep their horses.  D'Artagnan hurries
from the Palace and snaps an order.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Saddle my horse!

The grooms jump to work; several young Musketeers nearby stop
their training, noticing their Captain's agitation.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Hurry --

But then d'Artagnan sees Athos coming, riding furiously
through the Musketeers' gate.  D'Artagnan steps out to meet
him as Athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos, my friend --

Athos marches to the palace door; d'Artagnan cuts him off.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos, please...!

                     ATHOS
          Get out of my way.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
               (grabbing him)
          Athos, I beg you --

Athos punches d'Artagnan with furious strength, knocking him
aside.  The young Musketeers reach for their weapons, but
d'Artagnan is up quickly, throwing himself in front of Athos
again, blocking the doorway into the palace.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Where are you going?

                     ATHOS
          To kill the king.

At this, the swords of the young Musketeers sing from their
scabbards.  Athos wears a sword, but he has not drawn it.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Athos!  I know life means nothing to
          you at this moment, but I will not
          let you kill yourself.

                     ATHOS
          The King killed my son!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The cannons killed Raoul!  The
          cannons, and love.  But not the King.

A YOUNG MUSKETEER steps up.

                     YOUNG MUSKETEER
          I'll kill the old man for you,
          Captain, if you don't wish to --

Athos spins, striking like a rattlesnake, his sword whipping
from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young
Musketeer's ear.  He flicks another's sword from his grasp,
then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the
chin of a third, shoving him back.

                     ATHOS
          Come on!  All of you!

D'Artagnan tackles Athos from behind and pins him face down
to the hay.  For a moment Athos bellows in rage --

                     ATHOS
          Coward!  Fight me!  Fight me...!

Emotion spills up into Athos' throat, and he begins to sob.

                     ATHOS
          He killed my son, d'Artagnan!  He
          killed my son...!

D'Artagnan, dying inside, still grips Athos.  Athos grows
quiet, and the young Musketeers drift closer.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Get back, all of you!

D'Artagnan stands, and Athos rises, still holding his sword.
He looks at d'Artagnan a long beat, then sheathes his sword
and turns to his horse.  The young soldiers move to him.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Let him go!

Athos mounts his horse, and with a last glance back at
d'Artagnan, he gallops away.

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

The King has just climaxed in his lovemaking, and lies spent
upon Michelle.  His rest is interrupted by a KNOCK at his
door.  The King scowls.

                     LOUIS
          What?!

                     VOICE
          Your Majesty... it is Andre.

Louis groans, and pulls on a robe.  Michelle whispers --

                     MICHELLE
          Shall I leave?

                     LOUIS
          No, you may wait behind the screen.

Michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as
Louis goes to the door and admits the young Lieutenant.

BEHIND THE SCREEN, Michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and
appraises her face; she begins brushing her long hair.  She
can hear the conversation...

                     LIEUTENANT
          I would not have disturbed you,
          Majesty, but you ordered me to keep
          you informed --

                     LOUIS
          Yes, yes, go on.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Athos, the former Musketeer, has
          just fought with several of your
          guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.

Behind the screen, Michelle pauses at the mention of Athos.

                     LOUIS
          Did they kill him?

                     LIEUTENANT
          No.  He cut an ear from one of the
          men, no one else was hurt.  Captain
          d'Artagnan allowed him to leave.
          Athos was upset about the death of
          his son, at the front.

CRASH!  From behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror,
shattering as it drops to the floor.  It startles the
Lieutenant, but the King goes on...

                     LOUIS
          Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me!
          Did he try to enter the palace?

                     LIEUTENANT
          ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan
          blocked his way.

                     LOUIS
          You may go, Lieutenant.

The Lieutenant moves back to the door.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Do you want Athos arrested, your
          Majesty?

                     LOUIS
          Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan
          to do it.

The Lieutenant leaves, and Louis moves behind the screen to
see Michelle stagger and grip the dressing table; her bare
feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror, yet she is
oblivious to the cuts.  Louis sees this and grabs her.

                     LOUIS
          My dear!  The glass -- !

He pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her,
cuddling her as she begins to shake.

                     MICHELLE
          Did you know... about Raoul?

                     LOUIS
          I did not want to upset you.  It was
          tragic.  I did everything I could
          for him.  I ordered him positioned
          in a spot of complete safety, far
          from the fighting.  But he
          disregarded my wishes and charged
          into danger.

He cuddles her as she weeps.

                     LOUIS
          I will order a Mass for his soul.
          It will guarantee his place in
          Heaven.

                     MICHELLE
          Oh Louis, Louis...

She clings to him in her grief.

EXT.  NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY

The great cathedral rises next to the monastery where Aramis
resides.  We PAN DOWN and PUSH IN on the cobblestones between
the two structures, as if penetrating to --

SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES

Aramis leads Porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis... is this the way to hell?

                     ARAMIS
          Hell may be our destination, dear
          Porthos, but not this trip.

They reach an iron door and move through it, into

A GORGEOUS, SECRET CHAPEL

Candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes.  The place is
breathtaking.

                     PORTHOS
          Where are we?

                     ARAMIS
          Jesus of Nazareth found the holy
          among the profane.  If we are to
          have a place of private prayer,
          where better than here, beside the
          channels where the shit and the
          garbage run to the river?

Porthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and
sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass.

                     PORTHOS
          Mother of God!

                     ARAMIS
          It is also a place of burial.

                     PORTHOS
          A tomb?  We're in a tomb?

                     ARAMIS
          Catacombs.  Very holy.

Porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment
-- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens.

                     PORTHOS
          Yaaaahhh!

A hooded figure, looking like the Grim Reaper, enters.

                     ARAMIS
          Relax, you big fool, it's
          d'Artagnan.

And sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been
led in by a little monk, is d'Artagnan.  Aramis nods to the
monk, who leaves quickly.  Before d'Artagnan can ask
anything, Porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and
monks usher in Athos, who freezes as he sees d'Artagnan.

                     ARAMIS
          It's all right.  D'Artagnan was the
          one who warned us that he'd been
          given an order for your arrest.
          Here you have sanctuary -- does he
          not, d'Artagnan?

The escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that
the four Musketeers are left to sit at a small table the
monks have set up, Athos and D'Artagnan opposite each other.

                     ARAMIS
          Look at us.  We are old men now.  But
          once we were young.  And when we saw
          injustice, we fought it.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          We have grown wiser with age.  Now
          we know that some problems cannot be
          settled with a sword.

                     ATHOS
          And some problems cannot be settled
          without one.

                     ARAMIS
          Well here is the problem at hand:
          the King has ordered me to discover
          the identity of the Governor General
          of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our
          English rivals have left the
          Catholic Church, Louis has struck on
          a plan to dominate the whole of
          Europe by uniting Church and State
          and making himself head of both.  He
          has already picked the Pope.  Only
          the Jesuits, who put God above
          throne or papacy, stand in his way.

                     PORTHOS
          But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope
          and King?

                     ARAMIS
          So they tell us.  But what are we to
          believe when the king is a tyrant,
          and the Church, meant to stand for
          all those oppressed, has become the
          tool of oppression?  When no
          conscience is tolerated?  No
          dissent, no objection?

                     PORTHOS
          It is a weighty problem, Aramis --
          but perhaps you should leave it to
          this secret General of the Jesuits,
          whoever he might be.

                     ARAMIS
          Easy to say, but hard to do.  For
          what I am trying to tell you is that
          I am the Governor General of Jesuits
          in France.

A stunned silence.

                     ATHOS
          What do you propose to do?

                     ARAMIS
          Replace the king.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I cannot hear this!

                     PORTHOS
          It can't be done.

                     ARAMIS
          It can.  I know the way.

                     ATHOS
          I am with you!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No!  Stop --

                     ARAMIS
          I will need you all.  All for one.
          One for all.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
               (jumping up)
          You -- You cannot ask me to betray
          my king!  I have sworn to him!

                     ATHOS
          It is honor you serve, and when the
          king is dishonorable you are removed
          from your oath of honor!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          An oath is an oath precisely because
          it cannot be removed!

                     ATHOS
          Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?!
          I know you have put service above
          your own life, but why does this
          King deserve such loyalty?  He is a
          monster!  He executes ministers for
          his own blunders, with their
          families hostage so they take the
          blame!  He has no honor!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No man is all bad... or all good.  I
          believe -- I must believe -- that
          Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can
          help him.

Athos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'Artagnan.

                     ATHOS
          Whatever the plan... I am in it!
          The next time we meet, one of us
          will die.

He storms out of the rear door of the chapel.

                     ARAMIS
          Porthos, see to Athos, won't you?

Porthos follows Athos; Aramis and d'Artagnan are left alone.

                     ARAMIS
          I have heard many confessions,
          d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not
          a priest, I could tell your heart
          has a secret weight, and it is
          hurting you to carry it alone.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The secret I carry I cannot share.
          Not even with God.

D'Artagnan moves to the door.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I cannot betray Louis.  I will
          defend him with my life.

                     ARAMIS
          I know.  God go with you.

D'Artagnan leaves Aramis alone in the secret chapel.

EXT.  THE MONASTERY - NIGHT

Aramis leads Athos and Porthos out of the catacombs.

                     ARAMIS
          This way.

They move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery.  A
hooded Jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows, then
recognizes Aramis and admits the trio to the monastery's
forge, where more hooded Jesuits are working in secret,
heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace.

                     ATHOS
          What are they doing?

                     ARAMIS
          Making the key to the throne.

                     PORTHOS
          They are very large keys.

One of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red
from the fire; he hammers it in a shower of sparks and
plunges it into water.  Aramis pulls the result from the
water and shows it to Athos and Porthos.

It is an iron mask.

EXT.  A CARRIAGE - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The carriage rolls through the long sweep of the French
countryside, traveling fast.

INT.  THE CARRIAGE - NIGHT

The three Musketeers -- Aramis, Athos, and Porthos -- have
been traveling for some time.  Porthos is asleep, snoring.

                     ATHOS
          Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't
          you think it's time you told me what
          it is you are plotting?

                     ARAMIS
          Soon enough.  Here we are.

Kicking Porthos' feet to wake him, Aramis opens the carriage
door, and they step out...

EXT.  FRENCH COAST - NIGHT

Lying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the
imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore.

                     ATHOS
          The Prison of Belle Sur.

                     ARAMIS
          Come, we have a boat waiting.

As hooded Jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them,
Athos and Porthos glance at each other; Porthos shrugs.

EXT.  AMONG ROCKS AT THE BEACH - NIGHT

The guides lead the Musketeers down a hilly path to a long
boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast.
Sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's
garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of
a mummy, with a rope tied at either end.

The guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf.
Aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked.
He's still fit and hard.  With the guides helping him, he
lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist.

                     ATHOS
          What is that?

                     ARAMIS
          A body.

                     ATHOS
          I see that is a body!  But where did
          you get it?

Aramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in
priest's garb.  With the robes spreading over the big bundle
added artfully to Aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat
priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds
to the illusion of Aramis as a wild, reclusive monk.

The sun is beginning to come up over the mountains.

                     PORTHOS
          He gets one day of confession each
          year.  Today is the day.

                     ATHOS
          Who does?

                     PORTHOS
          Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even
          talk about it.

Aramis steps onto the boat.  The little priest who first
joined them gets in too, along with a couple of rowers.

                     ATHOS
          What do we do now?

                     PORTHOS
          I don't know about you, but I plan
          to wait here.

The rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison.

INT.  FORTRESS PRISON - DAY

The pink light of the new day barely penetrates the gloom of
the prison.  The boat carrying Aramis and the little priest
reaches the gate of the prison, which reaches to the water
line.  As Aramis steps out, GUARDS meet them.

                     HEAD GUARD
          Who is this, then?

The little priest remains in the boat, slumped over.  One
GUARD speaks to the little priest in Italian, and the little
priest seems barely able to left his head; Aramis answers for
him, in Italian, and the guard translates --

                     GUARD
          He says he's the replacement.

Aramis rattles off more Italian.

                     GUARD
          He says it is only one day a month
          when the prisoner gets confession,
          and the little one is too sick to
          move.  The big one doesn't speak
          French either.

                     HEAD GUARD
          Then let's get it done.

The head guard gestures to let them pass.

INT.  CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK

The prisoner has used the torn Bible to make all sorts of
amazing origami, invented from his own head.  He looks up as
he hears the door open, and sees Aramis, the priest.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          My confession day!  But where is the
          other one?

Aramis says something in Latin -- the first words of the
ceremony of absolution -- as the guards lock the door behind
him and move off down the corridor.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I know you don't speak my language
          -- but is the other one all right?
          Please tell me he is not dead too,
          or I will have lost everyone.

Aramis goes on mumbling Latin mechanically, for the sake of
the retreating guards.  The Man in the Iron Mask is desperate
for someone to talk to.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I... tore my Bible.  Or someone else
          did.  But it was all right.  "Let the
          words of my mouth and the
          meditations of my heart be
          acceptable in Thy sight, Oh Lord our
          God and My Redeemer."

Aramis has stopped talking, and stares transfixed at this
sight of the prisoner, in the iron mask.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          I'm sorry.  You're never seen me
          before.  I must frighten you.

Aramis puts his finger to his lips.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What are you doing?  Why do you --

Aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole, and whispers --

                     ARAMIS
          I am a friend, here to help you.

Aramis hurriedly removes his robes, revealing the bundle.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          What -- ?

                     ARAMIS
          It is an escape.  To freedom.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Freedom...?

He says it as if the concept is beyond him.  Aramis undoes
the bundle, revealing the limp body.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Wh-- ?  He is dead!  Who is he?

                     ARAMIS
          He is you.

Aramis uncovers the head of the body.  It is covered in a
mask, identical to the prisoner's.

INT.  PRISON CORRIDOR - CELL

The Guards are sharing a bottle of wine, when they hear --

                     ARAMIS
          Hey!  Hey!

                     GUARD
          What now?

INT.  CELL

The guards enter to find the Man in the Iron Mask slumped on
the floor.  Aramis, looking like the fat priest again, stands
over him spouting Italian, as one GUARD translates --

                     GUARD
          He says he just fell stone dead as
          he was reading him the Mass.

                     HEAD GUARD
          I never thought the bugger would
          last this long.  But how could he
          just keel over and --

Aramis rattles off more Italian, and suddenly the guard who
understands it stops examining the body and backs off.

                     GUARD
          He says the prisoner has the fever,
          just like the little priest does.

                     HEAD GUARD
          Plague?  They brought plague in
          here?  Get him out of here.  Now!

Aramis rattles off a protest in Italian.

                     GUARD
          No, no last rites!  Get away!

EXT.  PRISON - DAY

Aramis climbs into the boat; as he sits down his belly stirs,
but the guards don't see it -- they are using poles to push
the boat away, into the sea.

EXT.  THE COASTLINE - DAY

Athos and Porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore, and
tucks in among the rocks.  Sheltered from the view from the
prison, Aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes.

The prisoner dangles, tied wrist and ankle, from around
Aramis' neck.

                     ATHOS
          My God...

Athos, Porthos, and the others gawk at the sight of the Man
in the Iron Mask, as Aramis loosens the ropes.  As they back
away from him, he sees the sky.  Endless blue -- and bright.
He shields his eyes.

                     ARAMIS
          It's all right.  Take your time.

Aramis helps him up, and turn him slowly around, to face...

The fortress/prison, in the distance.

THE PRISONER'S POV FROM WITHIN THE MASK:  A vast vista -- the
sky, the sea, and the prison on the island in the middle of
it all.  The prisoner falls to his knees, and weeps.

                     ARAMIS
          Athos... He needs a gentle hand.

Athos moves over hesitantly, and puts his hand on the
shoulder of the Man in the Iron Mask, who holds his hands
against the mask as if to further hide his shame.

INT.  THE PRISON - DAY

The guards are standing in the cell, looking down at the body
now wearing the mask, the man they think was their prisoner.
The guards are quiet, alone.

                     GUARD 1
          You ever wonder who he was?

                     GUARD 2
          No... Yes.  But I never asked -- and
          you better not either.

They wrap the body, still in its mask, in a weighted sack.

EXT.  PRISON - DAY

The prison's WARDEN GENERAL stands at the wall of the
fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw
off the body, wrapped in canvas weighted with stones.  As the
corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea, the Warden
writes a message on a royal scroll:

               THE UNSEEN PRISONER IS DEAD.

The Warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger.

EXT.  COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

A carriage pulls into a country estate, isolated among vast
woodlands silver in the moonlight.  Mysterious servants with
shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops.

INT.  CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Athos reaches for his sword, but Aramis stops his hand.

                     ARAMIS
          Jesuits.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE COURTYARD - NIGHT

Aramis emerges quickly, whispering directives to the Jesuits;
Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask from the carriage, his
head shrouded by a cloak.

Aramis has a blacksmith waiting; almost before he realizes it
the Man in the Iron Mask finds his head placed on an anvil;
but as the hammer rises he begins to scream.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No!  Please!

                     ARAMIS
          What is wrong?  We only mean to free
          you from the mask!

But the prisoner is shaking, and Athos understands why.

                     ATHOS
          Prison was horrible but it was his
          home.  He's been torn from it by
          strangers.  He's frightened,
          exhausted -- and the mask is
          familiar.  Let him rest in it
          tonight, and remove it tomorrow.

                     ARAMIS
          Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen
          sense of this man.

                     ATHOS
          His plight is obvious, isn't it?

Athos, angry with Aramis' arrogance and insensitivity, leads
the Man in the Iron Mask toward the house; then Aramis spots
Porthos, looking downcast.

                     ARAMIS
          And why are you so glum?

                     PORTHOS
          I expected action.  There was no
          killing, no fighting, I was useless.

In deep depression, Porthos climbs out and shuffles off.
Aramis sighs, shakes his head, and walks to the house.

INT.  MANOR HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask onto the bed; the eyes
behind the slits in the mask are darting, frightened.

                     ATHOS
          Are you hungry?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Just... water.

Athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table;
but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid
spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          This way.

The prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a
drink, then falls back to the pillow.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          This place... I once lived in a
          country house.  I had guardians --
          an old man and woman.  And tutors.
          But no friends.  Then when I was
          twelve, they came and took me to the
          prison.

                     ATHOS
          Who came?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          A man in black.  I never saw his
          face.  He took me to the cell.  A
          blacksmith came and they put me into
          the mask.  For days I shouted, "What
          have I done?  Why do you do this to
          me?"  But no one heard, so I just
          stopped shouting.

                     ATHOS
          And you never knew why?

                     PRISONER
          I thought... there is something
          about my face that men do not want
          to see.  Something that makes them
          cruel.  But then I realized they
          were cruel even when I was wearing
          the mask.  I knew there must be some
          other reason, but I could not think
          what it was.

                     ATHOS
          What is your name?

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          The old man and woman called me...
          Phillippe.

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe.  Rest now.

Athos moves to the door.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          Thank you... for your kindness.

Athos nods, pauses a moment... and leaves.

INT.  A DARK APARTMENT IN PARIS - NIGHT

The lock rattles, and the door swings open.  D'Artagnan
enters, lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room.
It is Athos' apartment, the one he visited earlier; now he
finds it empty, devoid of clues.  He stands there alone.

He turns to leave, then glimpses a familiar painting hanging
beside the door.  Lifting his light he studies the portrait:
Athos, Aramis, Porthos and himself -- four Musketeers, beat
friends, in their prime.  Together then, inseparable.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          My friends... Where have you gone?

He lowers the lantern, and leaves.

                                                  CUT TO:

THE MESSAGE FROM THE PRISON...

has reached the court.  Gloved hands pass the message from
one advisor to another, and finally to the King.

INT.  PALACE - KING'S STUDY - DAY

The King reads the message, rerolls it, thinks a moment, and
hands the scroll to Claude.

                     LOUIS
          Take this to my mother.

THE MESSAGE

is again passed, this time into the hands of the Queen
Mother's eldest nun-attendant, and then into the hands of the
Queen Mother herself.  The Queen is in her private rooms, and
for the first time we see her with her hair down.  She
accepts the scroll, opens it, and reads.

Her eyes fill with pain, grief, guilt... emotions she hides,
turning away.

                     NUN
          M'lady... are you...?

                     ANNE
          Please, just... go away.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan returns from his ride to Athos' place.  He looks
down at the Queen's door.  He checks the clock on the wall;
it is a few minutes past nine.  He enters his room, moves to
the window, and waits there, to catch a glimpse of her.

INT.  COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is digging into a hearty meal, while Porthos only
stares at his plate.

                     ARAMIS
          See?  There is plenty of food in the
          country.  But the King keeps it
          going to the army instead of --

Athos marches in, all business.

                     ATHOS
          He is sleeping.  Now see here,
          Aramis, it's time you told us --

He breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to
spoon food onto Porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his
nose, and she gives him a smile.

                     PORTHOS
          I have no appetite for food, I am
          wasting away.  Say goodbye to
          Porthos, for he is gone.  Even women
          don't interest me now.

The girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who
seem fascinated with the roguish Porthos; their giggles and
winks make Porthos even more morose; he tells his friends...

                     PORTHOS
          I tell you a secret.  I sleep with
          three women at once, not because my
          appetite is so great, but because
          now it take three to excite me.

Porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; Aramis
sighs, having heard all this before.  Athos sits down.

                     ATHOS
          Who is he, Aramis?

                     ARAMIS
          Tomorrow.

                     ATHOS
          Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man
          from a royal prison, we hide in a
          country chateau among an assortment
          of saints and sluts such as only you
          could provide, and still you wish to
          tell me nothing?!

                     ARAMIS
          You seek facts, when it would be
          better to seek truth.

                     ATHOS
          You are not my priest, Aramis!  You
          would not be, even if I had one.

                     ARAMIS
          You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn
          by grief, not only for Raoul, but
          for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and
          now treat as an enemy.

                     ATHOS
          He who is not with us is against us.

                     ARAMIS
          Those are the words of a broken
          spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have
          trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest
          secrets, and I will never believe
          he is my enemy.

                     ATHOS
          Then you are a fool -- a fool who
          has never lost a son.  What gives
          you the right to judge me, to play
          God with the lives of others?  Is it
          because you are so much holier than
          everyone else?!

                     ARAMIS
          There is that, of course -- but
          mainly it is because I am so much
          smarter than everyone else.

They are interrupted by Porthos' bloodcurdling SCREAM.

                     ARAMIS
          Porthos?!

He draws his sword and runs for the outside.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT

Aramis and Athos rush through the courtyard, surrounded by
moonlight and trees, confused about where Porthos is.  Then
they hear bellowing SCREAM OF PAIN from the latrine.

Swords drawn, they bang into the latrine, to find Porthos
just finishing urinating.

                     PORTHOS
          Kidney rocks.  It hurts when I pee.
          It hurts when I shit.  I'm just a
          fat old fart with nothing to live
          for any more.  I'm going to hang
          myself, as soon as I'm sober.

They watch him shuffle toward the main house.

INT.  THE PALACE - THE QUEEN MOTHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Anne paces in her room, her hands trembling, her beautiful
lips quivering with tortured emotion.  With a sudden impulse
she bolts from her room, through the outer room where her
attendants sit, and into the corridor.

                     NUN
          M'lady...?

The eldest nun follows her.

EXT.  PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT

Anne rushes through the evening, toward her little chapel in
the palace garden; she is a tragic, romantic sight, her long
hair flying behind her as she runs.

IN HIS ROOM, D'ARTAGNAN

has been standing at his window, for his nightly glimpse of
Anne.  Now he sees her, not with her retinue of nuns, but
running to her chapel, clearly distraught...

INT./ EXT.  PALACE GARDEN - GARDEN CHAPEL - NIGHT

Anne reaches the door, and finds a few nuns and an old priest
praying in the little chapel.  She staggers forward to the
altar.  and falls to her knees there.  The nuns and the old
priest, seeing the Queen Mother so distraught, stand silently
and file out, leaving her in solitude.

                     ANNE
          Oh God I -- Forgive me...

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          M'lady...?

She whirls to see him; the sight of her face, bursting with
emotions she has kept buried, draws him nearer.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          What -- ?

                     ANNE
          No, stay back!  Stay back!

He freezes in his tracks; she holds her hands out toward him
as if warding off a blow.  He's desperate to move to her; she
sees it on his face.

                     ANNE
          D'Artagnan!

Her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away; she
rushes into his arms.  They clutch each other, in an embrace
they have denied for many years.  They kiss hungrily.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          M'lady... if anyone sees, it is
          death...

                     ANNE
          If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I can't bear to see you cry.  What
          is wrong?

                     ANNE
          Nothing... Nothing.

She draws back; he tries to hold her.  But the thoughts of
answering that question makes her stiffen.

                     ANNE
          Nothing.  This... didn't happen.  I
          must go back now.

And just like that, their moment is gone.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

D'Artagnan and Anne move back to the palace in a stiff
procession, she walking ahead, he trailing like a proper
commoner, several feet behind.

INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

They reach the Queen Mother's room; d'Artagnan reaches to
open the door for her, and she keeps her eyes lowered.  But
before he can let her go, he must whisper...

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Anne...!  I know... I know that to
          love you is treason against France.
          But not to love you... is treason
          against my heart.

                     ANNE
          Then we will both die traitors,
          d'Artagnan.

With those whispered words hanging in the air, she enters her
room.  And d'Artagnan moves alone, back to his.

INT.  MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The King is trying to make love with Michelle -- but she
isn't responding.  He stops, exasperated.

                     LOUIS
          What is wrong?

She says nothing.  He tries kissing her again.

                     LOUIS
          What is wrong?!

She begins weeping uncontrollably, and turns from him.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul... Oh, Raoul...

                     LOUIS
          Listen, my darling... Raoul was
          a... a good friend.  And now he is
          dead and that is very sad but --

                     MICHELLE
          We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.

The King stands; he's had enough of this.

                     LOUIS
          No, my love.  You will burn in hell,
          for your sins.  But I will not --
          for I am King.  My position is
          ordained by God.

He snatches the gold coverlet from her bed to cover his naked
body and stalks to his stairway; the embroidered coverlet
trails behind him like a regal train in a royal procession.
Leaving her weeping, he moves down into...

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King angrily stalks around his bedroom, too agitated to
sleep.  He grabs food from the table by the window, and
starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops.  He sees
something out the window; it stops him dead cold.

It is a man, standing in the gardens, wearing an iron mask.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan!  Guards!

EXT.  GARDENS - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT

The apparition ducks into the shadows.

INT.  PALACE - D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has
just happened when he hears the king's shouts of alarm.

                     LOUIS' VOICE
          Help!

In an instant d'Artagnan is reacting, snatching up his sword
and racing out into the corridor, toward the King's room.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The guards outside the King's room find the door latched from
within, and they don't know what to do... D'Artagnan, running
up, never slows down; he crashes into the doors.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King whirls as the doors explode inward and d'Artagnan
barrels through.

                     LOUIS
          Out there!  Look!  Out there!  He --

The garden is empty.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I just left the garden, it was
          empty.  What did you see?

                     LOUIS
          It... was nothing.  A nightmare,
          nothing more.  Go away, I --

D'Artagnan guides his guards out, but glances back to see the
King, ashamed and worried.  D'Artagnan tells his men --

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Check the garden.

EXT.  GARDEN - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT

An old Jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where
the nuns have returned to pray.  He kneels at a back pew,
tucking the iron mask deep within his robes.  The young
Musketeers who move through the garden glance into the
chapel, see only the normal piety, and move on.  The old
priest crosses himself, bows his head, and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE - PHILLIPPE'S EYES, THROUGH THE SLITS OF THE MASK

They are frightened.  As we PULL BACK we see the Iron Mask,
in an OVERHEAD POV... Phillippe is lying on his back, his
head resting on an anvil.  Athos stands close by, lending
support; Aramis and Porthos look on.  A blacksmith stands
over Phillippe.  He positions the point of his chisel against
the lock of the mask.  It takes several ringing hammer blows
-- which we experience from a POV WITHIN THE MASK -- before
the lock breaks.

Athos, as gently as he can, pries open the iron mask.

PHILLIPPE'S FACE

is a wretched sight, overgrown with a matted tangle of hair
and beard, and with a deathly pallor.

Phillippe sits up, lifting his head out of the mask.  He
looks at the Musketeers, watching them for their reactions.
At first they are frozen; then there is recognition, awe.

Phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge, and looks
down into THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, at his REFLECTION.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly
          like... exactly like...

                     ARAMIS
          I will answer all your questions.
          But first soap, water, and a razor.

INT.  THE MANOR HOUSE'S MAIN DINING ROOM - DAY

Aramis and Porthos are sitting at the table when Athos ushers
in --

PHILLIPPE, CLEANED UP

The change in him is remarkable, and his face so identical to
the King's that Porthos actually jumps.  Phillippe takes a
seat opposite Aramis, and looks around, wary, vulnerable.

                     ARAMIS
          Yes.  Identical.

Aramis' eyes are aflame as he looks across at Phillippe.

                     ARAMIS
          The greatest secret of life is who
          we truly are.  Now I must give you
          that secret, which has been kept
          from you your whole life.  It began
          on the night when Louis was born.

                     PORTHOS
          I remember that night.  D'Artagnan
          was drunk, the only time I've seen
          him that way.  The three of us were
          reveling, remember, Athos?

                     ARAMIS
          But I was on duty...

IN FLASHBACK...

We see the shadowy Musketeer we saw in the opening, moving up
the dark steps of the palace.  We see now it was Aramis.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          I was summoned to the royal
          apartments.  Arrange a carriage,
          they told me, and wait by the door
          of the stables.

INTERCUT FLASHBACK

We see images of that night, as we saw in the opening.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          They brought a baby from the back of
          the palace, into the black carriage
          I had waiting.  They had given the
          driver instructions about where it
          was, and I was ordered to make the
          whole journey with the blinds of the
          carriage drawn.

In the flashback we see the young Musketeer Aramis, his face
shielded in shadow, handing a living bundle over to someone
at one of the back doors of a large country house.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          I carried that baby into the
          countryside, to a chateau, like this
          one.  And there I left him.

ARAMIS IN THE PRESENT

                     ARAMIS
          I have never forgotten that night,
          or what I carried.

                     PORTHOS
          I don't understand.  What does this
          have to do with...?  You carried a
          baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --

                     ARAMIS
          Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried
          the child of the king.

                     PORTHOS
          The child of the king is... the
          king.  Louis!

                     ARAMIS
          No, not Louis!

                     PORTHOS
          Athos, do you understand this?  He
          confuses me --

                     ARAMIS
          I carried the king's child!  The
          queen had twins that night, and one
          of them was sent away, in secret!

                     PORTHOS
          But why?

                     ARAMIS
          Because the old king had a twin as
          well, and through his whole reign
          his brother fought him for the
          throne.  Then he had two heirs, not
          just sons but twins.  So he decided
          that one be put away, as if he never
          existed.  You, Phillippe.

Phillippe is pale... We DISSOLVE TO a flashback of
Phillippe's early education in the country house.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          The old king ordered you be educated
          and well treated, but your identity
          kept from you and all those around
          you.

The FLASHBACK moves to the palace, matching the narration --

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          On his death bed, he revealed your
          existence to Louis and your mother.
          Your mother had been told by her own
          priest that you had died at birth.
          Somehow she blamed herself for ever
          believing it, and she wished to
          restore your birthright.  But now
          Louis was king.

We see in FLASHBACK Louis wearing his new crown, plotting.

                     ARAMIS' VOICE
          A priest, even a Pope, he could kill
          without hesitation, but he was
          afraid to kill you, for his whole
          claim to power rests on the sanctity
          of royal blood.  So he had you
          hidden in a way that only a monster
          could devise.  I know, for it was I
          who took you to prison, and the Iron
          Mask.  Someday I will ask your
          forgiveness.  But not until we have
          restored to you what is yours.

We are in present time again.  All eyes are on Phillippe.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Restored...?

                     ARAMIS
          We will replace Louis with
          Phillippe.  No one but the King
          himself -- and now we -- knows
          Phillippe even exists.  All we have
          to do is switch them.

                     ATHOS
          Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is
          ludicrous!

                     ARAMIS
          I have it all worked out.

                     ATHOS
          Physical resemblance is but one
          small thing!  Louis has an
          arrogance, a manner --

                     ARAMIS
          Those can be adopted --

                     ATHOS
          And people close to him, who --

                     ARAMIS
          Do you think I have not considered
          that?  I have a plan -- and you may
          rest assured that it is brilliant!

                     ATHOS
          It is not just our lives you risk
          with this conceit of yours!  It is
          Phillippe's as well!

                     ARAMIS
          Yes, and he has a choice!

Aramis stops thundering at Athos, and turns to Phillippe.

                     ARAMIS
          What about it, Phillippe?!  All that
          time in prison, all that time you
          suffered, was it for nothing?!  You
          memorized the entire Bible, or so
          your priest told me!  An act of
          survival, of defiance, of courage!
          Your years within the mask have
          given you reserves of strength that
          others could not imagine.  Your home
          was a dungeon and now you may be a
          king, if you have the heart to make
          it so!  Do you have the heart?

Phillippe stands shakily, and faces them.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I will try.

Phillippe walks -- nearly wanders -- from the room.

                     ARAMIS
          You see?  A king.

Athos, with a glare at Aramis, follows Phillippe.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE GARDENS - DAY

The gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a
French summer.  Athos finds Phillippe there, sitting alone.

                     ATHOS
          Recent hours have been a shock.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Perhaps not as much as you might
          imagine.  When tutors answered every
          question except those about who I
          was.  When I was imprisoned in a way
          no other man had ever been, I knew
          there was something different about
          me.  But a king...

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe... there is something I
          hope you understand.  Terrible
          cruelty has been used against you.
          And... you must understand that you
          did nothing to deserve it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          There is... wrath... in me.  I have
          learned to hide it.  Those years in
          the cell, I dreamed that freedom
          would someday just happen, the way
          the mask happened.  Now I am free.
          And with each free breath I feel the
          growing desire to make someone
          suffer for all I lost.  Look at
          this, all this that for ten years I
          could not see!  What if I become a
          king -- a king no different from my
          brother?

                     ATHOS
          The desire for vengeance... can be a
          poison.

                     PHILLIPPE
          What is its antidote?

                     ATHOS
          I suppose... it is to remember there
          are many people who have never been
          in a prison, who pass such beauty
          every day, and never see it.

Phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it.  He
looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in.
Athos looks around too; then Athos realizes Phillippe is no
longer looking at the garden, but at him.

                     PHILLIPPE
          You look so sad.  Is it something I
          have done?

                     ATHOS
          It is something I have done -- or
          did not do.

                     PHILLIPPE
          What is that?

                     ATHOS
          I did not share beauty with
          someone... who is no longer here for
          me to share beauty with.

Before Phillippe can pursue this, Athos turns businesslike.

                     ATHOS
          We have much to do, we'd best get
          started.  Now suppose you were to
          walk into a garden, as a king...

INT.  MANOR HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is having dinner; he calls toward the kitchen.

                     ARAMIS
          More wine!

Athos enters and sags into a chair, his energy spent.

                     ARAMIS
          How is he?

                     ATHOS
          Resting, he's had a long day.
          Aramis --

                     ARAMIS
               (calling out)
          More wine!!

                     ATHOS
          You must reconsider this plan.
          Phillippe is like a child, he --

                     ARAMIS
          You can do it.

                     ATHOS
          In a year, maybe two, I could teach
          him enough to --

                     ARAMIS
          Three days.

                     ATHOS
          Three days??!!

                     ARAMIS
          The King is having a ball, a
          masquerade ball.  It is the perfect
          opportunity and perhaps our only
          one.  At any time Phillippe could be
          discovered, and what then?  Remember
          France.  Remember the poor.
          Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where
          are those serving girls...?

EXT.  CHATEAU - NIGHT

As Aramis and Athos are downstairs arguing, we PAN UP to the
window of a candlelit bedroom...

INT.  CHATEAU BEDROOM - NIGHT

We PAN from the window to the bed... where Porthos is making
love -- or trying to.  We see his huge, bare, broad back,
blotting out all view of his partner.  He grunts, then roles
over in despair -- revealing not one but three serving girls
lying beneath him, jammed side-by-side like firewood, all
nearly smothered by Porthos' bulk.

                     PORTHOS
          It's no use.  My sword is bent.

                     SERVING WOMAN
          It'll be all right.  You're just
          taking a while to get started.

                     PORTHOS
          No, it's dead.  I am useless.

Porthos heaves himself out of bed.

EXT.  CHATEAU - NIGHT

While Aramis and Athos are visible through the window,
arguing and gesturing, Porthos -- still naked -- walks across
the moonlit courtyard, to the barn.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's
          perceptive, but he is in such
          turmoil --

                     ARAMIS
          You grow fond of him.  That's good.

                     ATHOS
          Don't play God with me, Aramis I --

Athos interrupts himself as he glimpses the naked Porthos
moving across the courtyard toward the barn.

                     ARAMIS
          Go on.

                     ATHOS
          But -- what is Porthos doing?

                     ARAMIS
          Going into the barn naked -- or so
          it appears.

We INTERCUT Porthos in the barn with Aramis and Athos in the
house...

IN THE BARN

Porthos, alone within the barn, finds a thick plow rope and
fashions a noose.

IN THE HOUSE

                     ARAMIS
          Now.  You were saying?

                     ATHOS
          But -- what is he doing?

                     ARAMIS
          About to hang himself, I should
          think.

IN THE BARN

Porthos throws one end of the rope over the central beam of
the barn, and ties the other end off.  He shoves a milking
stool up below the noose, climbs onto it, and fits the noose
around his neck.  NOTE: When we see him in full view it is
only from behind -- and this angle is a sight to behold.

IN THE HOUSE

Aramis' detachment only aggravates Athos' excitement.

                     ATHOS
          Hang himself?!

                     ARAMIS
          He's threatened to do it, it's been
          building up in him for months.

                     ATHOS
          We must stop him!

                     ARAMIS
          Come now, Athos, if Porthos is
          determined to end his life, then he
          will certainly manage to find the
          opportunity.

                     ATHOS
          But -- but --

Athos jumps up and makes for the door -- but Aramis' hooded
helpers, at a signal from Aramis, bar his way.

IN THE BARN

Porthos, grave with drama, utters his last words...

                     PORTHOS
          A'dieu, cruel life!  Farewell to
          useless Porthos!

He steps off the stool.

His great weight drops.  The rope snaps taught.  The beam it
is tied to snaps like a twig -- right in the place where it
has been sawn nearly in half already.

Porthos falls unencumbered and slams butt first into the
floorboards of the barn, cracking them.

ARAMIS AND ATHOS

can hear the crack from where they're sitting.

                     ARAMIS
          I sawed the main beam in half.

IN THE BARN

The chain reaction has just begun.  The broken floorboards
buckle, and the barn's walls, deprived of their central
support, fall in on each other.

IN THE FRONT ROOM

Athos and Aramis watch wide-eyed as the whole barn completely
collapses around the unfortunate Porthos.  Athos gives Aramis
a look.

                     ARAMIS
          I'm a genius -- not an engineer!

They jump up and run out.  The commotion draws others too --
especially the three wenches Porthos had been trying to bed.

THE COLLAPSED BARN

It's a tangle of debris -- and from the size and weight of
the pile, it looks as if no one could live through the
collapse.  For a moment the whole pile lies silent; then
suddenly it bursts apart and Porthos emerges, exploding with
anger.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis!!  You did this, didn't you!
          You knew I would try hanging myself,
          and you sawed the beam!  Admit it!
          Admit it, by God!!  ADMIT IT!!!

Porthos' eyes are bulging; he's terrifying in his fury.  And
he holds one of the broken barn's timbers like a giant club,
ready to bash in Aramis' brains.  Aramis is totally casual.

                     ARAMIS
          Well of course I knew it, Porthos.

Porthos stands there, blinking.

                     ARAMIS
          You've been moping for months.  Now
          that you've gotten the idea of
          killing yourself out of the way, you
          can stop boring me and start being
          useful to me.  Now get some rest.

                     PORTHOS
          Well... Well... Okay.

Porthos starts back toward the house.  Then one of the
serving girls, heading back inside, sees in one of the upper
windows -- the face in the Iron Mask.  She SCREAMS --

                     WENCH
          AAAAAAHHHHHHH!

Phillippe shies back from the window now, but it's too late,
everyone has seen him.  Aramis, with cold intellectual
curiosity, quietly observes the women's reaction, even as his
hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened
locals.

                     ATHOS
          Poor Phillippe!

                     ARAMIS
          The mask is terrifying... especially
          when unexpected.  Do you notice?

                     ATHOS
          All I noticed was that Phillippe
          feels even more like an animal.

Athos hurries in; Aramis looks at Porthos.

                     ARAMIS
          See, Porthos -- secrets are hard to
          keep.  We don't have much time.

INT.  PHILLIPPE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Athos enters to find Phillippe in a corner of the bedroom,
slumped and ashamed in the darkness, holding the mask.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I've worn this mask so long, I
          couldn't sleep without it.

                     ATHOS
          I will sit with you.  I can't sleep
          either.

Athos settles into a chair, as Phillippe lays the mask aside
on the table and closes his eyes.  Athos looks toward the
flames of the fireplace, and in their dancing shadows he sees
the face of Raoul.  Phillippe's voice interrupts --

                     PHILLIPPE
          Athos...?  Thank you for being my
          guide... back into the world.

Athos had not thought of it that way.  Phillippe closes his
eyes again, and falls asleep.

INT.  PHILLIPPE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Light falls on Athos' face; it is dawn.  He hears the whinny
of horses, and looks out the window to see a carriage about
to leave.  Reacting quickly, he hurries out quietly.

EXT.  CHATEAU - MORNING

Aramis and Porthos are already loaded into the carriage, as
Athos runs up.

                     ATHOS
          Where are you going?!

                     ARAMIS
          Paris.  There is still much to do.
          We'll be back soon.  Be ready.

                     ATHOS
          But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn
          in time, but --

                     ARAMIS
          He can learn to be Phillippe in
          time.  But first he must learn to be
          Louis, and for that he has two more
          days.

                     ATHOS
          What you're asking is impossible!

                     ARAMIS
          I offer you the perfect revolution.
          A revolution without bloodshed,
          without any loss of life, even
          without treason, for he too is the
          son of the King.

                     ATHOS
          But --

                     ARAMIS
          You said you'd do anything, Athos,
          anything to replace this King.  So
          do it.

Aramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives
the horses away.

Athos, wide-eyed and alone, watches the carriage roll away.
He turns back toward the house, and see's Phillippe looking
out the window -- without the mask.

INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Athos and Phillippe are having breakfast.

                     ATHOS
          No, wait, do not hold your goblet
          that way.  With a king it is... so.

He shows him, pinching the goblet between thumb and
forefinger, as the other three fingers extend daintily.

                     ATHOS
          It is not to be dainty.  Servants
          have touched the King's goblet, so
          he will touch it as little as
          possible.

Phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers,
crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --

                     ATHOS
          No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be
          sorry!  The King cares for nothing
          and for no one!  There are no
          mistakes when you are King!  What
          you do is right for every person!  A
          King has contempt for everyone!

                     PHILLIPPE
          Is that the king of king you wish me
          to be?  Or do you say this because
          of your son?

                     ATHOS
          How did you know -- ?

                     PHILLIPPE
          Porthos told me.

For a moment Athos can say nothing; then he shoves back from
the table and storms from the room.

INT.  COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - ATHOS' ROOM - NIGHT

Athos is pacing in his room, all alone, rehearsing the things
he wants to say to Phillippe.

                     ATHOS
          I am not... I am not angry with you.
          You understand?  Good.  Now, as to
          acting like a king, we wish you to
          be a good king.  But at first... at
          first you must pass as Louis, and
          Louis is cold and cruel.  So you
          must stop looking at people with
          such softness.  It is... not Kingly.
          The eyes of a King say that all he
          cares about is himself, and your
          eyes -- how do I tell him this -- ?
          You eyes... ask so much.  You
          shouldn't care about me, about my --
          about...

Athos' voice breaks, his body sags.

                     ATHOS
          Oh Raoul, my son... my son...

Athos weeps.

INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Phillippe sits alone in the parlor; he looks up as Athos --
his face washed, no sign of grief -- marches in.

                     ATHOS
          Come, we have much to do.

MONTAGE - ATHOS TRAINING PHILLIPPE

-- They practice sword fighting, Athos being sure that
   Phillippe knows Kingly posture...

-- They rehearse holding court, with Athos showing Phillippe
   how to sit in a chair like a King on his throne, and then
   Phillippe trying it, with Athos then playing the roll of a
   courtesan paying homage...

-- They rehearse courtly dancing; and as they stumble, both
   of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous, they laugh.

EXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Aramis' carriage rattles to a stop, the hooves of the horses
sounding hollow on the cobblestones.  They are near the same
area where the riots occurred; now, at night, everything
looks deserted.  Aramis steps from the carriage.

                     ARAMIS
          Coming?

                     PORTHOS
          What use am I?

                     ARAMIS
          We go someplace dangerous.

                     PORTHOS
          Why didn't you say so?

Porthos steps out with him, and Aramis leads the way down a
dark, spooky alley.

EXT.  PARIS BACKSTREETS - NIGHT

They walk through the murky darkness of Paris' backstreets.

                     PORTHOS
          It is good to be out on a mission
          again... We are out on a mission,
          aren't we?

Aramis grunts non-committally, lost in thought.

                     PORTHOS
          You're right.  Tell Porthos nothing.
          He needs to know nothing, for he is
          useless.

Just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows
and blocks their way.  He holds a knife.  Another ROBBER with
a sword rises from a doorway beside them.

                     ROBBER
          Your money or your life.

Aramis looks bored; Porthos stands blinking in surprise.
Then a third robber steps up behind them, cocking a pistol.

                     THIRD ROBBER
          Make it quick, old man!

                     PORTHOS
          Old?  Old?!  You're all trying to
          rob us because you think we're old?

The man with a sword steps forward to hack Porthos down, but
Porthos spins, slapping the pistol, making it BOOM but miss;
he kicks the swordsman in the groin, then smashes his head
against the alley wall; he backhands the gunman.  The robber
with the knife tries to run; Porthos snatches a barrel from
the street and hurls it into the fleeing robber's back; he
falls in a heap.

Porthos' fury has just begun.  He picks the fallen gunman up
by the throat, slams him stomach down across a broken alley
cart, and with one sweep of his mighty hand Porthos snatches
down the man's pants.

                     PORTHOS
          Old?!  I'll show you old!!

Porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones.  We see
the shock and terror on the robber's face as he feels
something shocking happen behind him.

                     PORTHOS
          Let's see you rob somebody with your
          pistol there!

                     ARAMIS
          Come on...

Aramis, acting as if nothing happened, leads Porthos away.

                     PORTHOS
          I have to tell you something.  I
          love Paris!

Aramis has found what he's looking for:  a filthy brothel.

                     ARAMIS
          Here we are.

Aramis leads Porthos inside.

INT.  BROTHEL - NIGHT

Sleazy whores lounge around, women at the very bottom of
life.  They stir and try to look more appealing as the two
well dressed gentlemen enter.

                     PORTHOS
          Aramis... These are... these are
          whores!

                     ARAMIS
          So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord
          loved her.

                     PORTHOS
          Did she have tits like that?

A greasy, disgusting PIMP shuffles over.

                     PIMP
          What do you want?  White?  Black?
          Both?

                     ARAMIS
          No.  We want you, Father Belles.

The pimp reacts with fury, drawing a pistol.

                     PIMP
          Get out!  Now!  I will kill you
          where you stand!

Aramis slowly falls to his knees, before the pimp.

                     ARAMIS
          Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

The pimp -- the former Father Belles, the same man we saw as
the priest who prayed with the Queen at the royal birth in
the opening -- shoves his pistol at Aramis' face.

                     PIMP
          Don't!  Get out!

                     ARAMIS
          I have sinned.  And no other
          priest's assurance of forgiveness
          can mean as much as yours.  Tell me
          that I can be forgiven, no matter
          what I have done.

Aramis' eyes are hypnotic, staring deep into the fallen
priest's soul.  Porthos is bug-eyed, certain Aramis' head is
about to be blown apart.

                     PORTHOS
          He's going to kill you, Aramis.

                     ARAMIS
          Then let him kill me, if all my
          faith is wrong.

He stares at the pimp.  The pimp's finger trembles on the
trigger.

                     ARAMIS
          I have come to help you make it
          right.  I have come to take you
          home.

The pimp shakes convulsively; he drops to his knees, bows his
head, and weeps.

EXT.  STREETS OF PARIS - NIGHT

Aramis' carriage rattles through the dark streets; we play
these secret movement sequences with an ominous, Jack-the-
Ripper quality.  The carriage pulls into...

INT.  CATHEDRAL COURTYARD - NIGHT

The priests scurry out to meet it.  First Aramis emerges,
then Porthos -- but the appearance of the pimp surprises the
cathedral priests.  They cross themselves.

                     PRIESTS
          Father Belles!

Crossing themselves, they embrace the prodigal priest; one
MONK kneels before Aramis.

                     MONK
          You have made a miracle!

                     ARAMIS
          God makes miracles.  You make
          dinner.

As Aramis strides toward the dining room, a Jesuit hurries up
to him.

                     JESUIT
          The ball has been rescheduled -- for
          tomorrow.

As Aramis hears this in surprise --

                                                SMASH TO:

EXT.  ROADS - NIGHT

The carriage thunders through the countryside, back toward
the manor house.

EXT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Athos and Phillippe sit at a table in the shade of a tree; on
the table is a model of the palace which Athos is using to
drill Phillippe on the palace's layout.

                     ATHOS
          These rooms are yours.  Up these
          stairs -- or through this hidden
          passage -- is the room of your
          mistress... Michelle.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Whose rooms are those?

                     ATHOS
          Your mother's.

They are interrupted as the carriage bearing Aramis and
Porthos clatters in.  Aramis is out immediately.

                     ARAMIS
          Change the horses!  Clear out
          everything!  NOW!!

INT.  CARRIAGE - ROLLING - DAY

The three Musketeers, plus Phillippe, are hurrying back
toward Paris.

                     ATHOS
          Aramis, this will never --

                     ARAMIS
          Louis is planning a visit to the
          Vatican, then who knows where after
          that.  If we miss him now we may not
          get another chance.

                     ATHOS
          But --

                     ARAMIS
          It presses us but it is good for us
          too!  Louis' whims make him more
          vulnerable.  We are less ready, but
          so are his guards!

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan, unready?

                     ATHOS
          At a ball, everyone watches the
          King!

                     ARAMIS
          But what if something extraordinary
          happened?  Something so unusual that
          all the attention went to someone
          else?  Someone whose confirmation of
          Phillippe the King would never be
          questioned.

                     PORTHOS
          Who?

                     ARAMIS
          The Queen Mother.  Anne.

And Aramis leans forward to tell them his plan...

EXT.  PALACE - DAY

Teams of servants are filing in and out of the palace with
food and flowers, decorating the ballroom for the ball that
evening.  In contrast, Anne and her devout retinue of nuns
move in single file toward the garden chapel.

INT.  GARDEN CHAPEL - DAY

The nuns kneel at the altar as Anne enters the confessional.

INT.  CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY

                     ANNE
          Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

                     FATHER BELLES
          So have I.

He slides open the partition window between them.

                     ANNE
          Father Belles -- ?!

He taps a silencing finger to his lips.

                     ANNE
          They told me you were dead.

                     FATHER BELLES
          I was.  I see you are still a woman
          of faith.  I have come back to ask
          you if you believe that one lie can
          poison your whole life... and one
          truth can put it back together
          again.

Anne stares at the eyes of the priest, back from hell.

INT.  PALACE - KING'S ROOM - DAY

As Louis' tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock
costume, complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand,
he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful
young women arriving early for the ball.

                     LOUIS
          It shall be interesting tonight.

D'Artagnan enters, looking concerned.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty.  This ball, with an
          open invitation to the nobility of
          Paris -- we have no way of
          checking --

                     LOUIS
          You will protect me as you always
          have, d'Artagnan.

Through the window Louis sees more beautiful young women.

                     LOUIS
          By the way, Claude -- inform
          Mademoiselle Beaufort that she will
          be moving from her rooms --

He looks up to see that Michelle has entered through the open
door behind him.

                     LOUIS
          Never mind, it seems we have already
          told her.

But Michelle's appearance brings him up short.  It is not the
cruel brush-off; she is already harshly different:  her eyes
are red from crying, her lips are tight in anger.

                     MICHELLE
          Murderer!  Murderer!

She holds a letter, crushed in her hand.

                     MICHELLE
          I wrote Fromberge!  Under your seal!
          I wrote as you, demanding to know
          why he disregarded my order to keep
          Raoul from danger!  He writes back:
          "But your Majesty!  Your last letter
          ordered me to put him in front of
          the cannon!"

She hurls the crumpled letter into his face.  Everyone is
frozen, silent.  She staggers toward Louis as if to attack
him, then falls to her knees, weeping.  No one helps her...

Except d'Artagnan.  He kneels, hugs her shoulders, helps her
to her feet, and guides her toward her room.  But d'Artagnan
looks back once, toward Louis.

                     LOUIS
          Hysterical woman.

                     CLAUDE
          Sire, misuse of the royal seal -- !

                     LOUIS
          She'll be gone tomorrow.

As d'Artagnan and Michelle move out, they pass Anne, coming
in.  Anne and d'Artagnan exchange a look; he remembers to
give her a respectful nod, but she moves past, into the
King's dressing room.  Louis is surprised.

                     LOUIS
          Mother -- ?

                     ANNE
          May I speak with you?  Alone?

                     LOUIS
          I am preparing for a ball!

                     ANNE
          We haven't visited in three years.
          And we should have privacy.

Exasperated, Louis waves his attendants away.

                     LOUIS
          What is it, mother?

                     ANNE
          I wish to discuss your brother.

                     LOUIS
          He is dead!  By God's choice!  There
          is nothing to discuss.

                     ANNE
          First they told me he had died at
          birth.  Then your father admitted he
          was alive, but well cared for, in
          secret.  But the message that told
          of his death said he had been a
          prisoner.

                     LOUIS
          I am King, Mother!  And I do not
          wish to discuss this with you.

                     ANNE
          He was my blood -- and I demand to
          know what happened to him.

                     LOUIS
          Why would you ask now?  You never
          asked before!

                     ANNE
          Because I have dreamed of him.  Not
          as the baby they took away, but as a
          man.

                     LOUIS
          You have prayed too much.  Your mind
          is weak.

Avoiding her stare, Louis lifts a plaster bust of his father,
its eyes like the sightless pupils of Greek gods.

                     ANNE
          I believe in dreams, Louis.  They
          are our souls speaking to us, from
          that world beyond our eyes.  And
          that son I never saw in daylight was
          standing in the moonlight of my
          dreams.  And he wore an iron mask.

We see her from a low angle, from a POV behind Louis -- and
we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor.

                     LOUIS
          It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He
          is dead now!  Dead!

                     ANNE
          Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The
          night of my dream.

And the night of Louis' "dream."  Anne begins to walk out.

                     LOUIS
          If... if he was wearing an iron mask
          in your dream, then how could you
          know he was your son?

Louis smiles; he thinks he has her.

                     ANNE
          Then you did do it, Louis.  You did
          put your brother in an iron mask.

All the blood is gone from Louis' face.  Anne walks from the
room, past Louis' waiting tailors.  He snaps at them.

                     LOUIS
          I have a ball to attend!

They rush in.  As they scurry about, dressing him in gold,
Louis' composure returns; he stares at himself in the golden
mirror, likes what he sees... and smiles.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Aramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees.  The
Musketeers and Phillippe pile out, to find another much
grander carriage there waiting.  Aramis ushers them into it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Whose carriage is this?

                     PORTHOS
          It was mine.  But since you are
          about to be the king, it is yours.

The new carriage lurches away.

INSIDE THE NEW CARRIAGE

are bundles of elaborate clothes.

                     ARAMIS
          Phillippe first.

They begin to dress Phillippe in a masquerade costume.

                     ARAMIS
          Remember, Phillippe... nobility is
          born in the heart.

                     ATHOS
          Hold your goblet with two fingers.

                     PORTHOS
          And make love as if you don't care.
          The way Kings do.  And fart whenever
          you wish.

Aramis tucks a note into Phillippe's pocket.

                     ARAMIS
          Remember, all you have to do is get
          through tonight.  Smile and nod a
          lot, and if you get stuck just wave
          and announce, "Continue."  In the
          morning you hand this note to
          d'Artagnan, pardoning Athos and
          instructing that he, Aramis and
          Porthos be brought to the palace as
          your advisors.  And all is well.

Phillippe nods; everyone's nervous.  Aramis grabs more
clothes and hands them out.

                     ARAMIS
          Now the rest of us.

EXT.  THE PALACE - NIGHT

Carriages disgorge guests, wildly attired for the masquerade
ball.  Porthos' carriage pulls in among them.

INT.  PALACE BALLROOM - NIGHT

A magnificent masquerade ball is in full swirl; the dazzling
light of chandeliers bounces off the gilt ceiling and
sparkles on the jewels of swirling dancers, their numbers
multiplied in the polished mirrors that line the walls.

The King is dancing and laughing with sexy young ladies.
D'Artagnan stands to the side of the ballroom, ever watchful,
ever remote.

As the dancers swirl, each one wearing a distinctive mask in
the garish style favored by the French nobility of the
1600's, we see one particular couple -- a large man, with an
excessively large woman.  They are dancing vigorously, and as
they take a break behind a huge pillar, they lift their masks
enough for us to see that the man is Aramis, and the "woman"
is Porthos.

From the folds of their elaborate costumes they both withdraw
replicas of the iron mask that Phillippe once wore.

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan watches everything.  We
          have to be lucky.

                     ARAMIS
          We will make our own luck tonight...
          if Phillippe holds up.

Aramis peers across the ballroom, to where Athos and
Phillippe mix among the revelers, using thin sticks to hold
broad masks to their faces.  Behind the masks we see their
eyes -- Athos' intense, Phillippe's nervous and darting.

                     ATHOS
          Stay calm, you're doing fine.

Then Phillippe's eyes go strangely still; he sees, for the
first time in his life, his twin brother, the King.

                     PHILLIPPE
          My brother...

Louis dances the minuet, prancing as if he is the center of
the universe; but this bliss is broken when one of the
dancers who swirls by him -- it is Aramis -- lifts the
baroque outer mask he's wearing and reveals an iron mask
beneath.

The King staggers, stopping.  The sight stuns him, confuses
him; he looks around but the wearer of the mask has
disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers.  Louis'
hands dart to his eyes:  are they playing tricks on him?

Seeing his reaction, Phillippe whispers --

                     PHILLIPPE
          He knew.  He knew what they did to
          me.

The YOUNG BEAUTY dancing with Louis notices him falter.

                     YOUNG BEAUTY
          What is wrong, your majesty?

                     LOUIS
          Nothing, I -- continue.

Louis rejoins the dancing... and then sees, on the balcony
above him, a different person -- a huge "woman," Porthos --
who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below.

                     LOUIS
          There!  Do you see it?

                     YOUNG BEAUTY
          See what, Majesty?

Porthos has slipped away from the railing when the King looks
back up; the young beauty sees nothing, and turns back to the
King with a look that questions his sanity.

D'Artagnan notices the King's reaction -- though he did not
see the glimpse of the iron mask -- and is just as baffled as
everyone else when the King turns and staggers away.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty...?

                     LOUIS
          ... tired.  Must... lie down.

The music splatters to an awkward stop; Louis hurries out,
leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom,
with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Carry on, everyone...

The music begins again, and the party goers, not knowing what
else to do, politely continue.

Athos draws Phillippe away from the ballroom, into a side
corridor.

AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO THE BALCONY

Porthos waddles down stairs, and meets Aramis.

                     ARAMIS
          Quick, to the passages.

They hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went.

INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door
of his royal apartment.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty, is there anything -- ?

The King shuts the door in d'Artagnan's face.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The King falls upon his bed, pressing his hands to his head.

INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The three Musketeers and Phillippe move quietly up a stairway
and to the door of a room.  Phillippe whispers...

                     PHILLIPPE
          The room of the King's favorite
          mistress?

                     ATHOS
          She will be at the ball.

INT.  MICHELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The door opens and they move in; it is in fact empty, though
a mess.  They move to the wall, where Aramis, after a little
looking, locates the levers to open the wall/door to the
King's secret passageway.  Aramis enters first, the others
follow.  We half expect Michelle to pop up at any moment, but
the Musketeers enter the passage without incident.

INT.  SECRET PASSAGES - NIGHT

Aramis silently leads the others through the secret passage,
to the portal into the King's bedroom.

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King is lying on the bed; we see him from the POV of
someone approaching him slowly, silently.  When his eyes open
in panic, it is too late... We see Aramis, Athos, Porthos
from the KING'S POV as they swarm him.

                     ARAMIS
          It is Judgment Day.

His fist drops into frame... Louis loses consciousness.

LOUIS' POV

as consciousness returns.  He see Phillippe in Louis'
clothes.  Aramis, Athos and Porthos bow and say...

                     MUSKETEERS
          Your Majesty.

LOUIS, still on his bed, now wears Phillippe's clothes.

                     LOUIS
          Wh-- Wha--

                     ARAMIS
          Don't look so shocked, Phillippe.
          Come, you're going back to prison.

                     LOUIS
          Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --

Now Louis understands everything.  He tries to struggle, but
instantly Porthos shoves a rag into his mouth.

Aramis opens the main door a crack, and sees d'Artagnan has
entered his room down the corridor, through whose open door
he can guard the approaches to the King's rooms.  Aramis
shuts the door again and turns to the others.

                     ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan guards the hallway!  You
          must go back the way we came!

Athos puts his hands on Phillippe's shoulders.

                     ATHOS
          Now, your Majesty.  It is time.

Aramis and Porthos bow again to Phillippe -- now dressed and
looking exactly like the King.  Phillippe's mouth is dry; he
swallows hard, and follows Athos up the hidden stairs.

INT.  MICHELLE'S BEDCHAMBER

Athos and Phillippe move to the door; they stop there, and
Athos adjusts Phillippe's costume one more time.

                     ATHOS
          You know the way.

Phillippe nods, tremendously nervous.

                     ATHOS
          You have your note?

Phillippe pats his pocket, like a boy being sent off to his
first day at school.  He surprises Athos, hugging him.  Then
Phillippe opens the door and walks slowly down the hallway.
Athos stands at the door and watches him go, all alone.
Athos whispers, though Phillippe can't hear...

                     ATHOS
          You have the heart of a king.

Reluctantly, he shuts the door behind Phillippe.

IN THE HALLWAY, FOLLOWING PHILLIPPE

as he conducts himself through the ornate corridor, down the
gilded staircase... and into --

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

Phillippe enters the ballroom, and the reappearance of the
"King" draws new attention.  Everyone in the dazzling
ballroom seems to stop and look straight at Phillippe.

Phillippe freezes.  Stares, everywhere, stares!  For what
seems an eternity, he can't move.

But then he raises his hand and says --

                     PHILLIPPE
          Continue.

As if by magic the music plays, the dancing resumes.
Phillippe moves to the throne and takes his place upon it.
He seems to have made it; people glance -- dancing ladies,
young Musketeers, old advisors -- but no one gives him a
second look.  For a moment, Phillippe feels safe.

And then he sees Michelle, her eyes glassy and riveted upon
him.  She wears her most beautiful gown -- the first one
Louis gave her -- but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily.
Her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged, her hair is mussed;
she is drunk.  She weaves her way to him and curtsies
elaborately.

                     MICHELLE
          My gracious noble lord...

Phillippe's heart is pounding; he looks around for help.  He
can only guess who this woman is.  The advisors have now
noticed her; Claude quickly dispatches orders to keep the
party going along, and waves guards over.

                     PHILLIPPE
          How are you... Michelle?

She doesn't react, so he must have guessed right; but
Phillippe knows nothing of what happened just before the
ball, and he's ambushed by her anger.

                     MICHELLE
          How should I be?  I came to give
          this back to you.

She starts tearing off her dress.  Claude and the guards
reach her; the young Musketeers grabbing her.

                     CLAUDE
          Fret not with this, your Majesty --

But Michelle fights, slapping, clawing -- and when one of the
young Musketeers grabs her from behind, his arm to her
throat, Phillippe jumps up.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Stop!  You're hurting her!

Phillippe's face shows something Louis' never did:
compassion.  He looks into Michelle's eyes.

                     PHILLIPPE
          However I have wronged you I will
          make amends.  Whatever the cost.

Phillippe could not have said anything more unlike Louis;
everyone who heard the remark -- Claude, the guards, and
especially Michelle -- stare at him in frozen amazement.

Phillippe realizes his blunder; they've caught him.

The MUSIC STOPS.  But the attention is not directed at the
throne; all eyes shift to the main doorway, where Anne has
appeared.  She is indescribably beautiful; she wears a bright
gown, her hair is brushed and bejeweled, she radiates the
light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has
discovered, at forty, that she is more stunning than ever.

Her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance
of the King; everyone watches transfixed as she approaches.
Phillippe sees her -- his mother.  He stands on legs that
seem to have no bones.  His mother.

She moves to him, her eyes filling with tears.  When she is
almost to the throne, Phillippe falls to his knees before her
and kisses her hand.

No one can believe it, not from this King.  Yet the moment
strikes them as beautiful, and they applaud happily.

Phillippe and the Queen Mother rise, and guide each other --
depending on each other for support, to a seat, he on the
throne, she on a seat the servants place beside him.

Phillippe gives a wave.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Continue.

The ball continues, the music exuberant.  Michelle wanders
away, like a blind lamb.  Phillippe and his mother sit side
by side, holding hands, their reunion passing in private
between their clasped hands, and glistening in their eyes.

INT.  THE PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Michelle, alone and forgotten, staggers down the corridor
toward the King's rooms; she passes d'Artagnan's open door.

INT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - THE THREE MUSKETEERS

are tidying everything up; they have Louis gagged and trussed
up hand and foot, his eyes flashing hatred.

                     ATHOS
          Don't worry, your Majesty.  We have
          a prison for you, where you can rest
          peacefully.

Porthos drapes Louis over his shoulder, and they move into
the passages.  Just as they close the portal behind them, the
door opens and Michelle wanders in like a zombie.  Suddenly,
d'Artagnan is at her shoulder.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Michelle --

Then he sees the room is empty; he thought Louis was here.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Where is he?

                     MICHELLE
          In... the ballroom.  But he isn't
          the same man.

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

As a minuet ends, Claude raises his glass in a toast.

                     CLAUDE
          To King Louis!  And to Anne, the
          Queen Mother!

The guests applaud and reach for wine glasses; servants
present Phillippe and Anne with champagne, and they sip --

                     GUESTS
          To King Louis, and the Queen Mother!

Everyone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his
glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous
fingers, hitting the floor with a crash.

Dead silence; everyone is looking.  Then Anne drops her glass
too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is
part of the celebration.

As the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe --

                     ANNE
          I retire now.  Wait two waltzes,
          then retire to your room; and spend
          the night in safety.  We have much
          to talk about, and have the rest of
          our lives to do it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Good night, Mother.

                     ANNE
          Good night... my son.

She kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them.
She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR

Anne encounters d'Artagnan.  He stops, so taken by the sight
of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Anne!  You look --

Remembering himself, he bows deeply.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          My Queen...

                     ANNE
          D'Artagnan.

She takes his hand, not caring who is watching.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I have never seen a sight more
          beautiful than you, tonight.

                     ANNE
          We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.

She moves off, toward her room.  D'Artagnan enters the
ballroom.

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan sees "Louis" sitting on the throne.  More baffled
than alarmed, he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          How long has the King been back?

                     GUARD
          Some while, Captain.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          He didn't pass my doorway, I was in
          my room.

                     GUARD
          He must've, Captain, there is no
          other way here.

D'Artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin.

PHILLIPPE

sees d'Artagnan, staring at him... then calling more guards
over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry
away.  Then d'Artagnan moves to Phillippe, and bows.  He
looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Continue.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Sire, we have an emergency -- of
          security.  I must ask you to
          accompany me.

                     PHILLIPPE
          ... The ball... Continue.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I must insist, Sire.

Phillippe stands, and follows d'Artagnan from the ball.

INT.  PASSAGES TO RIVER - NIGHT

Aramis, Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the
secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a
drainage channel leading to the river.

They have stashed a boat there; they plop Louis into it and
climb in themselves.  They row toward the archway that is the
exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the Seine glow
outside, like a beacon of safe escape.

But the steel grate of the archway slams down just before
they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of
the darkness.  A shielded lantern rises and its wick is
turned up, revealing

D'ARTAGNAN

he stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers.  His
eyes are intense, his face in agony.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          My friends.

The only one they can see it d'Artagnan.  They all look at
each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Only we four, the most trusted
          Musketeers, knew about the passages,
          meant to keep the King safe... Your
          Majesty...

Phillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of
shame and failure as he looks at Athos, but still he holds
on, trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Yes...?  Why do you bring me here,
          d'Artagnan?

                     PORTHOS
          The King!  Look!  It's the King!

He means Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Then who is that lying beside you?

Porthos turns and looks at Louis -- then reacts as if he's
totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and
gagged beside him.

                     PORTHOS
          Wh-- ?  Where did he come from?

Athos grabs d'Artagnan's arm.

                     ATHOS
          If you ever loved me -- if you ever
          loved honor, or anything else --
          then stand now, and let it happen.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love
          you, I cannot.

D'Artagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind
Louis' hands, and the gag that has kept him from talking.
Aramis suddenly backhands Louis, knocking him flat on his
back in the boat, and pointing to him -- Louis.

                     ARAMIS
          This man is an impostor.  We caught
          him trying to impersonate the King,
          and were just getting rid of him.

Louis struggles upright.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan, arrest them all!

                     ARAMIS
          Shut up, knave!

Aramis slaps Louis again, and pleads with his eyes that
d'Artagnan accept their ruse.  D'Artagnan is dying inside.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Before I came here, I insisted the
          King come with me.  The real Louis
          would never have let me insist.

Seeing they are about to be arrested, the old Musketeers in
the boat spring into action against their younger
counterparts.  Athos swats one swordsman with an oar; Porthos
seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and
flings the man back into two of his comrades; Aramis grabs
Louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat.

                     ARAMIS
          Pull them back, d'Artagnan.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          You can't do it.

                     ARAMIS
          Pull them back!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Everyone back.

                     ARAMIS
          Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into
          the boat!  Now!

Phillippe obeys.

                     ARAMIS
          Open the gate.

D'Artagnan nods to his men, and they open the iron gate
leading out to the river.

The boat makes for the opening.  Just as it is about to reach
it, Louis forces Aramis' hand.

                     LOUIS
          You will not shed royal blood!

He kicks at the boat and struggles to stand, making the boat
tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around.  Aramis
draws the dagger away from Louis' throat to keep from killing
him, and d'Artagnan makes a grab at Louis and drags him onto
the stone floor of the channel.

The boat is almost through the opening -- and Louis snatches
at his brother, Phillippe.

The current outside the gate is rushing by, and the boat is
already caught in the current; it's pulling away and the
Musketeers can't stop it.  Athos seizes Phillippe's legs and
tries to hold him, but the pressure of the current is great,
and now not only Louis but some of the young Musketeers are
helping hold Phillippe.

Phillippe's legs slip out of Athos' grasp, and the boat
flashes downriver...

Aramis, Porthos and Athos have escaped... but Phillippe is
captured, looking into the hate-filled eyes of his twin
brother Louis.

INT.  SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Louis is angrily climbing through the passageways, back up
into the main floors of the palace, venting his emotions at
d'Artagnan, just behind him; the young Musketeers with
Phillippe, their prisoner, follow along further back.

                     LOUIS
          I want all these passages sealed!
          Another stupid idea of my father's!
          Seal them all, every one!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          It shall be done, your Majesty.

                     LOUIS
          Even the bedchamber passages!  Let
          none remain!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Yes, your Majesty.

They reach a doorway, and the King bangs through it, into his
own bedchamber, still spouting anger.

                     LOUIS
          I was told this impostor was dead!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          ... You knew you had a double?

                     LOUIS
          He is my brother.

D'Artagnan is frozen in surprise.  Phillippe and his guards
move into the room; seeing him in full light, wearing Louis'
own clothes, fans Louis' anger; he jumps forward and begins
ripping the royal garments off Phillippe.

D'Artagnan forces himself between Louis and Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I -- I thought he was but... an
          impostor who resembled --

                     LOUIS
          My twin.  Which has kept him alive.
          Until now.

                     ANNE'S VOICE
          No!!

They whirl to see the Queen Mother, who has entered through
the main door.  She hurries to the space between her sons,
hugging Phillippe, then trying to hug Louis.

                     ANNE
          Louis, please -- !

                     LOUIS
          My guards are useless!  Take her
          from me!

He motions to the young Musketeers to restrain her;
reluctantly they grip the arms of the Queen Mother.

                     LOUIS
          What had you to do with this,
          Mother?

                     ANNE
          He is your brother!

                     LOUIS
          He is nothing now.

Louis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young
Musketeers -- but d'Artagnan steps between him and Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty... This man before
          you... He is royal blood, the same
          as you.  To spill it is the one
          thing even you cannot do.  It is
          against the laws of God, and of
          France.

                     LOUIS
          Get out of my way.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Not once have I ever asked anything
          for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive
          this man, this prisoner... your
          brother.

                     LOUIS
          Forgive?!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I
          know what they have done was a
          threat against you -- and yet that
          threat has been removed, with no
          harm coming to your Majesty.  If
          their passions were in error, their
          spirits have ever been noble.
          Forgive them.

                     LOUIS
          They have plotted against me!  Me!
          The embodiment of God's will!

D'Artagnan sinks to his knees before the king.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty... Every day of your
          life, I have watched over you.  No
          angel could have stood a more
          faithful vigil.  I have bled for
          you, and have prayed, every day, to
          see you become greater than your
          office, better than the law.  Show
          me now what my faith and blood have
          purchased.  Show mercy.

The words cut into everyone:  Anne, Phillippe, the young
Musketeers.  But Louis' eyes are cold, as he responds --

                     LOUIS
          You take the side of traitors?

                     PHILLIPPE
          Please, may I speak?  M'lord... I
          beg that you kill me.  I release
          you, before Almighty God, from any
          claim of sin in taking my life.  In
          fact I will pray that God reward you
          for your mercy to do it.  But do not
          -- I beg you -- return me to the
          prison, where I have lived so long.

Phillippe's plea makes Louis pause... then smile.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan, you will hunt down
          Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring
          me their heads, or I will have
          yours.  And as for you, Phillippe...
          Back to the prison you shall go, and
          into the mask you hate.

                     ANNE
          No, Louis!  No!

                     LOUIS
          Wear it until you love it.  And die
          in it!!

Anne screams, and Louis waves to the guards, who draw her
from the room, as d'Artagnan sags, on his knees before the
King he has served so faithfully.

Slowly, Phillippe lowers his head.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM

D'Artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the
bed and drops his face into his hands.

Then he hears the sound, like a SCREAM, but short and
muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog.  He lifts his
head sharply; where did that sound come from?  He is almost
too tired, too sad, to investigate.

Then the King, already shaken by the night's events, hurries
into d'Artagnan's room.

                     LOUIS
          What was that sound?!  Did you hear
          it?  It came from Michelle's room!

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER

D'Artagnan enters, ahead of Louis.  They see nothing unusual,
and d'Artagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward Michelle's
apartment.

MICHELLE'S APARTMENT

D'Artagnan enters the room, and finds it empty -- but the
window is open.  He moves toward it...

INT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER

The King is pacing as d'Artagnan reappears.

                     LOUIS
          Where is Michelle?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          There.

He points to the window.  Louis shoves open the drapes and
leaps back in horror.  Michelle has hanged herself outside
Louis' window, the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose
around her neck.

INT.  QUEEN MOTHER'S APARTMENTS - DAWN

Anne has changed; she is tormented, but alive with energy,
pacing.  There is a knock at her door, and the old nun opens
it to d'Artagnan.  The old nun leaves them alone; d'Artagnan
moves to Anne and takes her hands, to look into her eyes.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          There were two.  Not one.  But two.

                     ANNE
          I couldn't tell you.  You had enough
          to carry.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Anne... The night we had together...
          I always wanted more.  But that one,
          it was enough.  Enough to make me
          love you forever.  I want you to
          remember that... and go on.  As
          strong as you are now.  No matter
          what happens.

He kisses her.  She drinks in his love.  Then he stands and
moves to the door.  He looks back, then stares out.

                     ANNE
          D'Artagnan -- ?

He looks back once more; he seems to want to tell her
something; but whatever it is, he can't find the words, and
with a last loving look at her, he walks away.

EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE BASTILLE - NIGHT

A sudden visual, establishing the Bastille, the horrific
legendary prison of Paris.

INT.  BASTILLE - NIGHT

Phillippe, his head covered in a burlap hood, is rushed
through the twisting stairways of the prison.

INT.  A CELL, IN THE BOWELS OF THE BASTILLE

The guards remove the hood, and Phillippe sees the cell.
Then he sees the blacksmith there, with a new iron mask, and
his eyes take on a fresh horror.

                     PHILLIPPE
          No.  Please!  No!

The guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over
Phillippe's face, as he screams.  They seal the mask with a
small padlock, whose key is distinctive, and jeweled.

INT.  BASTILLE - LATER

The two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after
completing their work.  Far above them, in the prison tower,
the cries of the prisoner echo; he sounds like a raving
madman now.

The two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base
of the tower; the BASTILLE JAILER looks up.

                     BLACKSMITH
          Pay me quick, I want out of here.

Soldiers, swords drawn, appear in the doorway behind them.

                     GUARDS
          What --

                     BASTILLE JAILER
          You saw the prisoner's face.

Understanding, the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the
soldiers; but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer, and
the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him.  A soldier
lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard.

THE KEY

is handed to the King by Andre, the young Lieutenant.  Louis
hangs the key around his own neck, with a thin gold chain.

                     LOUIS
          Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?

                     LIEUTENANT
          Out directing the search for the
          traitors.

                     LOUIS
          When he returns, watch him.  When he
          leaves again, you tell me.

The Lieutenant bows.  Louis smiles, and fingers the key.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Squads of young Musketeers gallop along the river, and
through the dark streets around it, searching...

ALONG THE BACK WALL OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, three forms
scurry through the darkness:  Aramis, Porthos and Athos,
heaving, wheezing.  They duck into a niche of the wall to
avoid capture from another patrol galloping by.  Then Aramis
unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in.

INT.  CATACOMBS

The three Musketeers struggle through the catacombs, reach
the chapel, and fall gasping to the floor.

                     ARAMIS
          Bloody hell...

                     ATHOS
          We can't... stay here.  That traitor
          d'Artagnan... knows about this
          place.

                     PORTHOS
          Can we eat... before we go?  This
          excitement's given me an appetite.

                     ARAMIS
          Bread and wine... in that cupboard.

Porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of
the lantern.  The rising light reveals a note, stuck to the
cupboard with the blade of a dagger.

                     PORTHOS
          A note.  Pinned with a dagger, like
          the old days.

He removes the note, and reads...

                     PORTHOS
          "Phillippe has been removed to the
          Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At
          midnight tonight I will order the
          guard changed, and will delay the
          replacements for ten minutes.  That
          should give you ample time.  Never
          have I needed more to say:  One for
          all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."

                     ATHOS
          He lures us to capture.

                     ARAMIS
          He seeks redemption.

                     ATHOS
          You're a fool!

                     ARAMIS
          Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am
          certain.  What he did tonight was
          what he told us all along he would
          do -- be faithful to his King.

                     ATHOS
          So what has changed?

                     ARAMIS
          Perhaps he serves a different king.

                     PORTHOS
          What choice is there?  If Phillippe
          is in the Bastille, then to the
          Bastille we will go.

                     ATHOS
          You are right.  But it is a trap.

                     PORTHOS
          So what?  I'd rather die covered in
          blood, than an old man, lying in my
          own piss.

                     ARAMIS
          Then to the Bastille.

                     ATHOS
          To the Bastille.  And death.

EXT.  BASTILLE - NIGHT

The stone walls rising into the Paris night seem to ooze
evil.  The building looks impossible to get into, much less
get out of; its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood,
encased in stone ramparts.

We hear a sharp, echoing KNOCK; Aramis, Athos, and Porthos
stand outside the main entrance, Athos slumped between the
other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail.

No one answers their knock; the three Musketeers exchange
doubtful glance, and Porthos knocks again.  A guard inside
slides open a view port of the massive door.

                     PORTHOS
          Open up!  We have a prisoner!

The port shuts, bolts rattle, and the great door heaves open.
The Musketeers glance at each other again, and play their
roles, Aramis and Porthos dragging Athos inside.

INT.  THE BASTILLE - MAIN COURTYARD - NIGHT

The prison courtyard is murky in the darkness, and ringed by
doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons.

                     GUARD
          Take him down to level three.  The
          Captain will see to the documents.

Aramis and Porthos drag Athos into one of the shadowy portals
surrounding the courtyard.

INT.  BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The three Musketeers duck into the inky shadows; Aramis cuts
the bonds that hold Athos' hands, and gives him the extra
sword he had beneath his cloak.

                     PORTHOS
          It worked!

                     ATHOS
          It's a prison, you idiot!  They
          don't expect anyone to try getting
          in!  The problem will come when we
          want out!

Aramis shushes them, and leads them into another quiet
corridor.  They hear the distant bells of a church, then
suddenly they must scramble, as a platoon of guards carrying
torches troop up stairs into the corridor; the Musketeers
dart like rats into dark nooks; as the guards pass, the
Musketeers huddle, and the bells end their tolling.

                     ARAMIS
          Midnight!  We have ten minutes!

They press on, deeper into the Bastille.

INT.  PALACE - ANNE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Anne moves to the window, where she starts to kneel for her
nightly prayer; but she stops.  Outside in the garden, far
below her window, is d'Artagnan on horseback, waiting.  Their
eyes connect.  He has a single rose in his hand.  Never
taking his eyes from her, he places the rose on the stone
bench of the garden, and reins his horse away.

Then she understands what he was trying to tell her before,
in the hallway; it was goodbye.

EXT.  PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT

D'Artagnan rides away quickly, passing -- without seeing --
Lieutenant Andre, who has been watching him.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Through the night d'Artagnan gallops.  We see his destination
in the distance:  the Bastille.

EXT.  THE PALACE GATES - NIGHT

The great gates of the palace swing slowly open, and out ride
a whole platoon of young Musketeers, surrounding Louis
himself, on horseback and dressed like a soldier.

INT.  THE BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS

The three Musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs,
through another corridor, down another stairway.  They pass
cells; wretched prisoners look up, but none of them is
Phillippe.  Then the Musketeers surprise a JAILER.

                     JAILER
          Hey...!

But before the man can say anything else, Porthos has crushed
him like a bug against the wall.  They rip the huge ring of
keys from the jailer's waist, and take his torch.

PHILLIPPE'S CELL

He lies on the floor; he sees the light of a torch, coming to
him like sunrise... and then he hears a voice --

                     ATHOS
          Phillippe...?

                     PHILLIPPE
          How did you --

They open the door and release him -- from the cell, but not
from the mask.  He tries to hug Athos.

They head back the way they came.

EXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Louis and his platoon of young Musketeers ride through the
streets, scattering the paupers who sleep there.

INT.  BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

Back up the stairs... through one corridor... they start up
the second flight of stairs, then stop and scramble back.

                     ARAMIS
               (whispering)
          Someone's coming!

They take cover on either side of the corridor, and lift
their swords.  It's a man coming down the stairs, with a
hooded lantern... they raise their swords to strike --

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          The way is blocked above.  The
          Captain of the Bastille has turned
          back from the mission I sent him on,
          and is in the courtyard with a party
          of men.

                     ATHOS
          He lies.  He is here to trap us.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I came to see you safely out.  Check
          for yourself.

Porthos climbs the stairs to check; D'Artagnan looks at
Phillippe, in the mask.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          All you have suffered, I would
          gladly have borne myself, to keep it
          from you.

Athos spits on the floor, in derision.  But Porthos comes
barreling back down the stairway.

                     PORTHOS
          D'Artagnan is right, the courtyard
          is filling with soldiers!

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          This way.

He leads them quickly down a side corridor; the others have
no choice but to follow.

A SIDE CORRIDOR

D'Artagnan leads them around another corner, into a long
corridor; at the end of it is a massive door.  They reach it,
and d'Artagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal
seal of the Musketeers; he begins unlocking the three
padlocks that secure the door.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Once you are through, don't stop
          until you reach the river.

                     ARAMIS
          They will know you helped us, if we
          go this way.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          That doesn't matter now.

They open the door... and as they do they see Louis and his
platoon of young Musketeers arriving outside.

                     LOUIS
          There!  Stop them!

                     ATHOS
          Betrayed!

The young Musketeers serving the King jump from their horses
and grab for the door; but d'Artagnan leaps forward, his
sword flashing.  After a second of surprise, Athos, Aramis
and Porthos jump forward too, and there is a brief, bloody
skirmish at the door.  But the young Musketeers have
overwhelming numbers, and firearms too; protecting Phillippe,
the old Musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling
the door shut and latching it quickly.

                     ARAMIS
          Back the way we came!

They race back up the corridor -- the four Musketeers, and
Phillippe, in the iron mask -- and turn the corner.  They
reach another inner door, pass through it -- and see the
soldiers of the Bastille coming at them.

                     ARAMIS
          Back!

They retreat, and Porthos slams the second door.  Like all
the inner doors of the Bastille, it's heavy wood, a foot
thick, and Porthos seals it with a huger iron bar.  But
there's nowhere else to run.

                     ATHOS
          Trapped.

At the far end of the corridor, the King's young Musketeers
have the same keys to the outer door that d'Artagnan did, and
they are breaking through.  Louis and two dozen of his
personal bodyguard pour through the door.

                     LOUIS
          Charge them!

The young Musketeers obediently charge down the corridor.

Stepping up shoulder to shoulder -- Aramis, d'Artagnan,
Athos, Porthos -- the four veteran Musketeers meet the
charge, first with pistols, then with swords, a wall between
Louis' men and Phillippe.  The battle in the cramped confines
of the corridor is bloody and fierce; the young attackers can
only get a few men into the fight at any one time, and those
who step before the famous veterans are cut down.

Louis' young Musketeers retreat, to regroup.

AT LOUIS' END OF THE CORRIDOR

Louis is furious, jumping at Lieutenant Andre, who has
dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight.

                     LOUIS
          Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!

                     LIEUTENANT
          The corridor nullifies our number...
          And no one has stomach to fight the
          Captain.

Louis is disgusted by this loyalty -- and he has a solution.

                     LOUIS
          D'Artagnan!

AT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR

Louis' voice echoes down to the veteran Musketeers and
Phillippe, in the Iron Mask.

                     LOUIS' VOICE
          I am not angry with you.  I knew you
          would lead me to them, and so you
          have!  Lay down your sword, and I
          will not punish you!  I will let you
          retire in peace -- to live out your
          days in the countryside!  And I will
          give your friends a swift execution,
          if you surrender now.

The words bounce down the long corridor; then silence.
D'Artagnan stands holding his sword, staring away from his
friends, toward the King and his gang of young Musketeers.

                     ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should
          accept his offer, for we are dead
          anyway.

                     PORTHOS
          He is right, d'Artagnan.

Athos says nothing; but when d'Artagnan looks at him, he
lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted d'Artagnan's
loyalty and friendship.

Phillippe speaks up, from behind the Iron Mask.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all
          your lives.  You have done your
          best.  Let me go, and let all of you
          find peace.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          No.  Even if I could give up my
          friends, I could never give up my
          son.

This hits them like a bombshell -- and suddenly it all makes
sense; d'Artagnan's loyalty to Louis, his dogged hope that he
could somehow influence him toward goodness.  We see their
stunned faces, each in turn:  Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and
Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I never had any idea you existed...
          until they found you.  And in all
          that time, I never had a moment's
          pride as a father -- until now.

D'Artagnan and Phillippe embrace, lost father to lost son.

From the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful
pounding; the Bastille's soldiers are trying to break it
down.  Time is running out.

Aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the
outside, barred now by Louis and his young guards, their long
muskets bristling like spikes; and yet that way is the only
possible hope for escape to the outside.

                     ARAMIS
          D'Artagnan... Those are young
          Musketeers down there.  They have
          been weaned on our legends.  They
          revere us -- it is an advantage.
          Why don't we charge them?

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          I trained those men myself.  They
          will stand and fight.  But if we are
          to die, let it be this way.

He draws his sword and points it into the air.  Aramis lifts
the tip of his sword to join that of d'Artagnan.  Porthos
does too... and then Athos joins them.

                     ATHOS
          One for all.  All for one.

                     PHILLIPPE
          If I could have a blade, then I
          would be please to run with you.

D'Artagnan gives Phillippe a dagger.  They look at each
other.  Then d'Artagnan begins to scream.  The others take up
the shout.  Then they step around the corner, and charge.

THE LAST CHARGE OF THE MUSKETEERS

We film it in all its glory, a visual feast:  the Last Charge
of the Musketeers.  Their capes swirl about time, their hair
flies, their legs take on new life.

At first the young Musketeers at the end of the corridor are
frozen in surprise; their youthful Lieutenant is awed by the
dashing, beautiful bravery of the thing.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Magnificent valor...

                     LOUIS
          Shoot them!  Shoot them!

Louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and
fires:  SSSBOOM!  With the first explosion of gunfire the
others pull their triggers; the powder in their weapons
flashes and crashes...

The musket balls fly down the hallway, sparking off the stone
walls and floor, ricocheting, punching holes through the
capes and flesh... but still the Musketeers charge like the
young men they once were -- still are, in spirit.

In the confines of the Bastille's stone corridor the noise is
deafening, and the space in front of the guards is filled
with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder.  None of them can
see anything beyond it... and all is quiet.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Draw blades!

The King's Guards draw their swords, and wait; are all the
old Musketeers dead?

Slowly the figures emerge from the smoke -- in SLOW MOTION,
walking now, no need to run.  All are wounded, but all are
still alive.

The Four Musketeers, along with Phillippe, move slowly and
steadily toward the blades of the young Guards; a fight to
the death?  So be it.

But the young Lieutenant will have none of it; as one of his
men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of d'Artagnan,
the young Lieutenant bats the sword down, with his own.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Stop!

He steps forward toward d'Artagnan; but instead of thrusting
his sword he salutes with it.

His men follow suit, saluting and bowing to the courage of
these men they have grown up wanting to follow.

King Louis, for the moment, is frozen.

D'Artagnan looks back at Phillippe; he has bullet holes in
two different places at the edges of his clothes, but he is
unwounded.

Then d'Artagnan sees Louis, with his long dagger, leaping at
Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          NO!

D'Artagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls
Louis backwards, then spins to Phillippe.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Phillippe!

                     PHILLIPPE
          I am unhurt --

Louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again, driving
the blade into d'Artagnan's back.

D'Artagnan's face jolts; he staggers, his legs buckle.
D'Artagnan falls into the arms of his friends.

Louis stands holding his bloody dagger, everyone staring at
him:  d'Artagnan, the old Musketeers, the young ones.

                     PHILLIPPE
          You!  Vicious... evil...!

He leaps into Louis, overwhelming him in fury, wrenching the
dagger from his brother's hand and gripping his throat.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Phillippe...!  No... Don't... He is
          your brother!

Phillippe releases Louis, who falls, choking, gasping.
Lieutenant Andre is surprised by what he just heard.

                     LIEUTENANT
          Brother...?

Phillippe darts to d'Artagnan, being cradled by Athos; Athos
lifts a hand from d'Artagnan's back; it is drenched in blood.
D'Artagnan is dying.

Athos, Aramis, Porthos... none of them can speak.  They grip
d'Artagnan, as if through their will alone they could keep
his life from leaking away.  The young Musketeers stand
transfixed, watching their legendary Captain die.  Phillippe
sags; his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief.

                     PHILLIPPE
          All this time... I was a lost
          secret.  But you were hiding all
          your loyalty, all your love.  You
          were the Man in the Iron Mask.

                     ATHOS
          D'Artagnan...

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Shhh.  All my life, this is the
          death I have wanted.  To die among
          you.  One for all... and all for...

He is gone.

Phillippe rises with a slow, terrible resolve, and moves to
Louis.  When Louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the
blade of the young Lieutenant Andre pointed at his chest.

                     LIEUTENANT
          All my life, all I ever wanted to
          be... was him.

He points to d'Artagnan.  Phillippe rips away the key that
dangles around Louis' neck.

                                                  CUT TO:

AT THE OTHER DOOR

where the soldiers of the BASTILLE'S COMMANDER are finally
breaking through; working the massive door aside they find --

THE KING with his guards, and Aramis, Athos, Porthos, along
with their prisoner, in the Iron Mask.

                     LIEUTENANT
          We have recaptured the prisoner.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No, no!  I am your --

A blow in his chest from the Lieutenant stuns the prisoner
and drops him to his knees.  The King orders the BASTILLE
GOVERNOR --

                     KING
          You will put this madman where no
          one can hear his insanity.  Let him
          be fed by a deaf mute.  But feed him
          well, and let him have a long life
          within the Iron Mask.

                     BASTILLE GOVERNOR
          And them?

He means Aramis, Porthos, and Athos.

                     KING
          They are my loyal servants.

                     MAN IN THE IRON MASK
          No!  No...!

But the guards are dragging him to the deepest, darkest
dungeon of the Bastille.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LANE OF ELMS - BESIDE THE PALACE - DAY

At the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's
graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble
monument stone above the final resting place of d'Artagnan.

Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and the King -- Phillippe, known as
King Louis now -- stand gathered there, as Aramis in his
priest's garments utters the funeral incantations.  Aramis'
voice breaks as he does so.  Porthos' eyes pour out rivers of
tears.  Athos' grief is beyond weeping.

Phillippe holds the arm of his mother.  She holds the rose
d'Artagnan left her.

                     ARAMIS
          Amen.

Athos moves up between Aramis and Porthos, and links them
with his arms.

                     ATHOS
          He was the best of us all.

Aramis and Porthos move off together, to walk the lane of
elms; Athos remains by the grave, unable to leave.

Phillippe pats Anne's arm.

                     PHILLIPPE
          I will be with you in a moment,
          Mother.

She too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the
rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face.

Phillippe moves up to Athos.

                     PHILLIPPE
          After all you have done, I must ask
          you one more service to your king.
          I have lost my father.  And you have
          lost your son.  Let me love you like
          a son to a father.  And I pray you
          live for this, to love me like your
          son.

Athos can't speak; he can only nod yes.  Phillippe moves to
join his mother, leaving Athos to take one final look down at
the grave.  Then as Athos moves off to join Aramis and
Porthos, we PAN from the name "D'ARTAGNAN" on the stone, to
the pattern chiseled beneath the name.

It is a mask, of iron.

                                                FADE OUT.

MAIN TITLES


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach
with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see
much of the background which is receding from us.
THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at
each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the
aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They
are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with
an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The
CAMERA STOPS at the end of the bus.


EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The French driver and a couple of his companions, Arab.


EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS,
photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the
screen is the destination board. By the time we get
opposite the window out of which the McKennas are
looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA --
MARRAKESH."


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window.
Jo's interest seems only casual.

                      HANK
          Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa
          before? It looks familiar.


INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

Shooting through the McKenna's window at the landscape
moving by. It is semiarid desert. A line of blue-
grey mountains in the distant.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo studies the landscape.

Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus     is
entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and    plaster
building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys    and one
camel. A  few pedestrians, mostly Arab men, few    women.

Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.

            This isn't really Africa, Hank.    It's
            French Morocco.

          It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!

Jo and Ban smile at Hank.

                       HANK
          Marrakesh.   Sounds like a drink.

Ben runs his tongue across his lips.

          You bet it does.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open
desert once again. It looks parched and grim.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank
grows, restless. He looks about for something to do.
Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes.
Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her
place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the
bus and test its possibilities for adventure.

The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly
makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab
village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to
bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better
than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a
particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger.
In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to
grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only
succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman.
Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her
face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,

The woman still covers her face, but from the seat
next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and
makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's
robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining
twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The
Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank,
repeating his demand.

People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the
reason for the trouble.

saying. They being talking among themselves.

and fascinated by his verbal attack, Hank retreats.

Except for the French passengers, everyone in the bus

Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his
son and the oncoming Arab.

Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother,
still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab
who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's
benefit.

                       BEN
          Now wait a minute.     Wait a minute.
          Simmer down.

The Arab continues pointing, talking.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes
rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the
Arab. He pushes in between the pair.

                         LOUIS
              (To Ben)
          Pardon me.

He turns to the Arab, moves him back   a little, sharply
silences his attack, and then begins,   in Arabic, to
explain firmly that the boy meant, no   harm. It was an
accident. The Arab isn't convinced,    points to Hank.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he
is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the
Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The
Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS
him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats,
growing quiet.

pleasant-looking young man. He is LOUIS BERNARD.

          A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments
          in life when we all need a little help.

He holds out his hand to Hank, who takes it.

          You talk Arab talk.

                         LOUIS
          A few words.

                      JO
          Why was he so angry?      It was an
          accident.

                       LOUIS
              (Half shrugs)
          The Moslem religion allows for few
          accidents.

Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who
moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so
that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In
the rear windows behind them we see the retreating
landscape of French Morocco.

                      LOUIS
          How different.

                      BEN
          For Josephine. Called her Jo so long,
          nobody knows her by any other name.

                       HANK
          I do.   Mummy.

She smiles at Hank, rubs the back of his neck.

                      LOUIS
          Now about the "accident." You see, a
          Moslem woman never takes off her veil
          in public under any circumstances.

                      HANK
          They feed her intervaneously?

Louis looks at the boy with some surprise.

                      LOUIS
          Quite a big word for such a small boy.

          That's all right. We tried everything
          to got rid of them. We never thought
          of a Frenchman.

Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues

helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,
to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage
of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped
bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to
take the people to their various destinations in the

put the McKenna's baggage aboard the first  available
carriage. He picks up his own small bag.

          He was asking, you were telling. You
          might as well have handed him your

          What difference does it make?    I have
          nothing to hide.

                      JO
          Maybe Mr. Bernard has.

          Jo. I know this is mysterious Morocco.
          Inscrutable natives gliding through

                      BEN
          Then relax. You're just mad because
          he didn't ask any questions about you.

She looks at him briefly without any expression.    Then
she malts into a smile.

                      JO
          Bitter medicine, doctor.   But I'll
          swallow it.

The carriage swings into the driveway of the Hotel
Mamounia. It is a rich-looking building, elegantly
landscaped. The CAMERA PANS it to the entrance of the
hotel. Several hotel employees move quickly to meet
it. They help the McKennas descend, and assemble the
baggage.

It is now evening, and we are in the double bedroom
and single bedroom of the McKennas in the Hotel
Mamounia. We are able to see through into the single
room where Hank is, brushing his teeth while his mother
supervises his getting ready for bed. Jo is already
dressed for the evening in a smart-looking outfit.
Ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror. He just
lust finished putting on his shirt.

At the far end of the room there is a   balcony over-
looking the hotel gardens. By a small    table stands
Louis Bernard dressed with unobtrusive   good taste. He
is looking into the garden beyond. On    the table are
glasses and a shaker of martinis.

In the single room occupied by Hank. Jo is putting

pajamas, but still has his shoos on.

                      HANK
          How about it, mummy?   One chorus.

                      JO
          I'm a little out of form, Hank.

                      HANK
          One chorus, and that's all.

                       JO

He tap dances a vamp introduction to the song. He's
quite professional. Then he stops, takes a pose, and
begins singing in a small, but not untalented voice.

                      HANK
          When I was lust a little boy
          I asked my mother "What will I be?"
          Will I be handsome?
          Will I be rich?
          Here's what she said to me:

Jo takes up the song. Her voice is obviously
professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful.

                      JO
          Que Sera Sera, whatever will

There is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on

          I asked my teacher "What should I try"
          Should I paint pictures?
          Should I sing songs?
          This was her wise reply:

Hank looks up happily to his mother, as she sings to
him with love. Hank whistles a harmony accompaniment
to the next verse.

                      JO
          Now I have children of my own
          They ask their mother "What will I
          be?"
          Will I be handsome?
          Will I be rich?
          I tell them tenderly:

They sing the chorus in harmony together.

Just before they finish the song, there is a loud
knocking at the outside door. The song trails off.

Ben goes to the door, tightening his tie on the way.
He opens it. A waiter is there with a tray of food.

from the back bedroom.

          of serving you a drink.

Jo takes a seat, and Louis leans against the railing.

                        JO
            Yes, I was on the American stage, and
            the London stage, and even the Paris

            time is often a luxury.

                        JO

            What?

                        LOUIS
            Whatever gives the best profit.

She puts down     her drink with some exasperation. As
she does, she     glances back toward Ben. He's getting
his coat, but     pauses to give her a slight smile and a
look that says     "You're wasting your time."

                        JO

            Just what are you buying, or selling,

She opens it, and standing in the corridor is a
silhouetted figure. We cannot see the face. Jo
switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious

toward Louis Bernard for help in translating the French.

As the McKennas turn, the man in the doorway lifts
himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in
the direction of Louis Bernard.

The man immediately turns his attention back to Ben,
and begins talking in broken English.

As Ben closes the door, we see that Louis Bernard has
been advancing into the room for a better look at the
man in the doorway,

                (To Ben)
            May I use your telephone?

Ben gestures that the phone is his. The CAMERA PANS
Louis to the phone, which he picks up, and begins
talking in French asking first for the operator, and a
certain number. Beyond that his conversation is a
mystery, because his face reveals nothing. (Possibly
speaks Arabic.)


INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

As Louis Bernard talks on the phone, Ben goes to   pick
up his drink. He comes back into the room, as JO    enters
once again from the bedroom. She looks at Louis,    then
at Ben who shrugs his shoulders. Louis finishes    his
phone conversation, hangs up.

                        LOUIS
            I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go
            to dinner with you tonight.

I had neglected an important matter which now requires
my attention. Perhaps, another night...

He bows briefly and moves towards the door. The
McKenna's look at each other quite bewildered.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. FULL SHOT

The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an
Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has
a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on
cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding
in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently
serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen.
The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled
with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes.
Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in
the background. The light is supplied principally
from candles.

As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO
REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant,
The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben
is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at
the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through
her face.


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions
eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are
the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel
Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had
stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man
next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass
them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking
over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.

The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions
directly behind those of the two people who stared at
them.

          I think you will find this comfortable.

He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around
as if trying to find another seat.

          Ben...

                      BEN
          Sit down, Jo, please.   People are

and somewhat awkward, has trouble.

He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his

          You're right. People are staring at
          us.

                         BEN
          What people?

She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people
sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but
all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns
back.

                      JO
          They stared at us when we went into
          the hotel.

                      BEN
          Jo, will you stop imagining things?

Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look
behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind

other.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Good evening.

Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the
man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way
around toward Jo.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          You must think me awfully rude. I've
          been staring at you ever since I saw
          you at the hotel.

Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
              (She peers at Jo)
          You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?

Jo visibly relaxes and becomes Jo Conway. It's Ben's
turn to give her a triumphant look in return.

Mrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her.

          Didn't I tell you? I knew I was right.

          I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my

          How do you do, sir!

          How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs.
          McKenna.

                      DRAYTON
          My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared
          at the London Palladium a few years
          ago.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Of course we hardly ever see a show.
          Edward is such an old stick-in-the-
          mud. So I have to console myself with
          your records.

                      DRAYTON
          And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not
          one for this terrible Bee Bop or
          whatever you call it.

          When are you coming back to London?

                      JO
          Possibly never again, professionally.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Don't tell me you've given up the stage.

          it's very hard for my patients  to come
          all the way from Indianapolis  for

Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly.

          Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying
          the wrong thing.

We now find the Draytons and the McKennas are  sitting
in a group, eating dinner together. There is   no back
to back awkwardness. All  are busily tearing  whole
roast chickens apart with their bare fingers.   Drayton
holds a piece of chicken aloft, demonstrating  the proper
Arab method of eating.

          Only the first two fingers and thumb
          of the right hand. Never use the

                      JO
          Does it have something to do with
          religion?

          them all.

                      J0
          Three finger -- four fingers -- for my
          money this is nothing but chicken in

          Well, as I was saying, I was quite
          happy farming my bit of land It
          Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from
          the United Nations started worrying
          me.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Edward was a big noise at the Ministry
          of Food during the war, you know.

                      DRAYTON
          So, I pulled myself up by the roots,
          and here we are. United Nations Relief.

                      BEN

Louis Bernard is standing in the entrance of the
restaurant. On his arm is a rather elegantly dressed
woman. She is also handsome and graceful. As he stands
waiting for the headwaiter, Louis Bernard looks around
the restaurant. His eyes stop when he comes to the
McKennas. He looks directly at them without the
slightest sign of recognition.

The headwaiter comes up to Louis Bernard, exchanges a
few words with him which we cannot hear, and then leads
the couple to a set of cushions in the far corner of
the room. As he moves away from the entrance, Louis
Bernard does not look at the McKennas.


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners
watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but
the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize
that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or
speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.

                      JO
          Well just what do you think of that?
          First he promises to take us to dinner --

          and publicly insulted.

                      BEN
          Can you blame him? Turning down an
          old married couple for a date with a
          girl like that?

          understand him -- and I'm beginning
          not to like what he's doing to our
          whole night.

Drayton, quietly amused, is listening to Ben and Jo.
But Mrs. Drayton is embarrassed. She makes conversation
at random.

              (To Drayton)
          I must do some shopping in the market
          tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine.
          Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I
          how our English weather is awful, but
          I sometimes think we don't know when
          we're lucky. All this sunshine, day

Ben makes as if to rise, but Jo holds him down.

          I want to get up.

                      JO

          By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd
          let us show you round the market place,
          tomorrow.

                      JO
          Louis Bernard, the big buyer from
          Paris, was going to take us through
          the market tomorrow.

She pushes him down again.

          Ben, don't. Our dinner's getting cold.
              (To the Draytons)
          We'd love to go with you.

Ben glares in Bernard's direction, and then picks up a
chicken leg.

                      JO
          I don't know why Ben gets so worked up
          over unimportant things.

Ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. Then
his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter
standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only
three fingers. Ben looks down at the chicken leg. He
is holding it gripped in his fist. This is too much.
He throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.

            C'est les deux que cherchez? (Is that

Drayton saunters behind them in the distance. Jo holds
out her hand for Ben to shake it.

                      JO
          All right, darling, a deal's a deal.

Ben takes her hand.

                      JO
          For every time step he'll learn a new
          muscle -- and for every chorus, three
          bones.

Ben can't help chuckling.

                      BEN
          And for every matinee?

                      JO
          Two chapters of Grey's Anatomy.

They stop short of bumping into Hank and Mrs. Drayton.

                      HANK
          Hey, Mummy.
              (He points)
          Sewing machines! Looks like a
          television commercial.

                      BEN
          Now If we could only get four cases of
          the Seven-year itch, we could retire.
          Or, if Mrs. Yarros really has triplets,
          we could at least redecorate the house.

              (Laughs)
          Oh, Ben, what would they say if they
          heard us?

The CAMERA PANNING through the market place to a line
of veiled women all working at Singer sewing machines.
Drayton saunters behind them in the distance.

                      BEN
          One of the reasons I came to a place
          like Marrakesh is so that we could say
          things like this without anybody hearing
          us.

                       JO
          I'd like to say something where nobody
          can hear us.

                      BEN
          This is the safest place.

                      JO
          When are we going to have another child?

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

                      JO
          You're the doctor.   You have all the
          answers.

                      BEN
          Yeah -- but, but this is the first
          time I've heard the question!

They stop short of bumping into Hank and Mrs. Drayton.

                      HANK
          Hey, Mummy.
              (He points)
          Sewing machines! Looks like a
          television commercial.

Jo laughs appreciatively, and rumples his hair.

                      JO
          Having a good time, Hank?

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          He's delighted with everything.

At this moment, Mr. Drayton saunters up, and for the
first time the group is all together. Suddenly there
as some shouts in the distance. Everyone's attention
is drawn to the noise. Hank moves quickly, threading
his way through some people for a better look, the
CAMERA PANNING him away.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From Hank's viewpoint we see police chasing a white-
robed Arab figure. The police consist of a couple of
uniformed French officials and two or three others in
local Arab dress, with rifles slung over their backs.

                       JO
          Hank!

She starts forward after him, but Mrs. Drayton moves
faster than anyone. She passes both of the McKennas
and overtakes Hank.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton reaches down and takes hold of Hank's
shoulders, and pulls him toward her.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Hank, it's best to keep away from
          trouble.

Hank is looking away toward the chase.

                      HANK
          What's going on?

Mrs. Drayton looks toward the trouble.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          It looks as though the police are
          chasing somebody.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A closer view of the chase brings us back to where the
motor coaches are loading up, and for a moment the
police as lost to view.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high view of the open air tannery with its circles
of crude stone water tanks becomes the scene of a
further part of the chase. We see the white-robed
Arab leaping between the crude tanks with the police
yelling and running after him in the distance. The
difficulty of the obstacles enables the Arab to get
ahead of them, and we see that he is now able to dodge
through an archway into the grain market.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

As the chase passes through the grain market, it
scatters grain and grain sellers in every direction.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The pursued Arab dashes through an enclosure holding
the donkeys which are used to carry grain to and from
the market. There is quite a stampede, with the donkeys
running, kicking, and braying in fright.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

Through another archway the Arab now dashes down some
of the narrow streets of the Medina. Sapling branches
are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern
on the ground below.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the
police in pursuit, progress is made difficult by the
many shoppers and bicycle riders. One bicycle rider
trying to avoid the oncoming Arab turns and drives
helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of
wreckage is enormous.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The Arab turns into another street where the rows of
brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung
along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision
between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the
street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder.
In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated
with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and
hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab
continues on past. The police dash through the street
trying to avoid the dye themselves.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The Police reach a narrow intersection where the blind
beggars as squatting, begging alms. They pause. There
is no sign of their quarry. Then one of them points
to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left.
They take up the pursuit once again.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high, overhead shot of the narrow streets showing
that the police have caught sight of their man again.
But there seems to be something strange about the chase
now. Two white-robed Arabs are running. The second
Arab we haven't seen before, but he is faster than the
first man and is gaining on him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

A closer, level shot, the CAMERA PANNING, shows, the
two breathless men closing in on each other. As they
reach an intersection in the streets, lighted by a
shaft of sunlight, the new Arab comes up behind the
original man being chased and whipping out a knife
from under his robes, plunges it into the back of the
first man. Then he turns and quickly moves away into
a street on his left. The first Arab jerks his head
up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing,
Then he staggers into the dark shadows.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out
of sight for a moment so that the police continue their
chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted
down another side turning.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife
is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands,
vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM
as he staggers out into the open market place. His
shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the
knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA
MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and
shoulders as he attempts to go forward.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and
there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his
group.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Arab hesitates for  a moment, but the attitude of
his head shows us that  he has seen McKenna. He makes
his way desperately and  painfully toward him. He is
finding it difficult to  remain upright and even take
those last few steps.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view  of McKenna shows that those around him,
including his  wife and the Draytons, become frightened.
He spreads his  arms out to move them back protectively,
waiting to see  what is going to happen.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his
back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors
to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and
his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's
cheeks.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big close up of Ben's hands as his fingers slide off
the Arab's face. He turns his hands up and we see
they are covered with black grease paint.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The Arab's head his now dropped to the ground, and we
see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark
makeup which Ben's fingers had scraped off.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better.   The
Arab gasps out something in French.

                      LOUIS
          Ils ont trouvés... ils ont réussi à
          trouver...

Ben looks at him puzzled.

                      LOUIS
              (English)
          McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard.

Ben is quite surprised.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then
reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and
examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with
one arm and grabs Ben by the coat.

                      LOUIS
          McKenna -- listen to me -- first!

With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until
Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort
Louis whispers to him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us
to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so
much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least
enough to make any sense out of what he says.

                      LOUIS
          A man...a statesman...is to be
          killed...assassinated...in
          London...soon...very soon...tell
          them...in London...to try Ambrose
          Chappell...

Presently, the mouth stops speaking.    It remains still
and open.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open
mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the
robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly
withdraws. Ben rises.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard,
the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a
large flat cement section of the market place. The
Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash
quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis.
Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and
Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the
rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines
it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis
Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo
turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to
the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to
Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes
out a pen.

                      JO
          Ben -- who is he?

                      BEN
          Louis Bernard. Got something to write
          on?

She begins looking in her purse.

                        JO
          Is he dead?

           Yes. Yes. He's dead.

She   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it
out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book
end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches
him   with mystified curiosity.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also
seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the
notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the
pen. Before either man can comment on the writing,
the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French.

                       POLICE ONE
           Savez vous qui est cet homme?

The uniformed French policeman approaches Ben.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman repeats his question as he stops in front
of Ben.

                       POLICE
           J'ai dit: Savez vous qui est cet homme?

Drayton steps forward to help.   He addresses the police.

                       DRAYTON
           Il ne parle pas francais.   Je traduirái.

The policeman nods.   Drayton turns to Ben.

                       DRAYTON
           He wants to find out if you know this
           man.

The policeman watches their faces.

                       JO
           Of course we know him!
               (She points)
           It's the frenchman, Louis Bernard.

Her gestures, and her comments, although In English,
give the policeman all the information he needs.

                       POLICE ONE
               (Looks at body)
           Louis Bernard?

He moves away toward the body, which the other policemen
are now covering with a sheet.

He gives them some instructions in French.

Ben looks at Jo in a way that says "Who asked you to
say anything."

The French policeman returns to the group.    He addresses
Drayton.

                      POLICE MAN
          Quel est le nom de ces personnes?

                      DRAYTON
          McKenna.

                      POLICE MAN
          Dites leur que j'aimerai qu'ils viennent
          tous les deux au commissariat pour
          faire un rapport.

Drayton nods unhappily, and turns to Ben and Jo.

                      DRAYTON
          Just as I thought. He wants both of
          you to go to police headquarters to
          make a statement.

                      BEN
          Do we have to?

                      DRAYTON
          I'm afraid so.
              (He turns to wife)
          Our friends here have to go to the
          police Station. I'm going with them
          to give what help I can.

          Alons-y.   Sil vous plait.

Police Two moves across the square with Drayton. Ben
and Jo precede them. Drayton begins conversing in
French with them about the crime, but we cannot
distinguish their words clearly. Jo looks back and
gives a little wave to Hank.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The McKenna's are walking across the square with the
Police and Drayton a few yards behind them. The CAMERA
MOVES with them. Jo moves close to Ben and speaks to
him in a surreptitious manner.

                      JO
          Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab-
          outfit, wearing makeup?

                      BEN
          What's more important -- why was he
          killed?

                      JO
          I'll bet he was a spy, or something
          like that.

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

                      JO
          Ben, what did he whisper to you?    What
          did you write down?

                      BEN
          I'll tell you later.

Ben looks at his hands.

                        JO
          What is it?

                      BEN

          said about Louis Bernard last night.

The main hallway and waiting room of the Police Station
in Marrakesh. French and Arab personnel move up and
down the wide hallway from one doorway to another.
There is a babble of voices and the sound of phones
heard off. The McKennas and Drayton are seated on a
long bench, waiting to be called into the inner office
of the Police Inspector. Drayton sits next to Ben.
It is hot. Jo has eyes for everything, but Ben seems
to be somewhat impatient. He looks at his watch for
the third or fourth time in a minute.


INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Drayton notices him studying his watch. He leans to
him, and at the same time wipes off the side of his on
face with a handkerchief.

                      DRAYTON
          Once we talk to the police inspector,
          I'll do my best to out some of the red
          tape.

                      JO
          I have to stretch.

She gets up and saunters away, looking around the police
station for whatever there is to see. Drayton speaks
to Ben with reassuring geniality.

                      DRAYTON
          I'm afraid the questions will go on
          till doomsday, if you admit knew this
          chap Bernard before.

                      BEN
          I didn't know him at all.     We only met
          yesterday on a bus.

                      DRAYTON
          They're a cynical lot, these French --
          they might refuse to believe that.

                      BEN
          They'll have to believe me.     It's true.

                      DRAYTON
          It might sound a bit odd,    from their
          point of view. They saw     the poor chap
          whispering to you ... and    then they
          saw you writing something    down...

Ben looks at Drayton, waiting for his to go on.

                      DRAYTON
          The question is, are you going to show
          them what you wrote down?

Before Ben can say any more, a policeman opens the
door leading to the Police Inspector's office. He
calls out.


INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and
Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench.

The policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police
Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He
is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile.


INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor,
stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton
speaks first.

                      DRAYTON
          Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les
          McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne
          parlent pas francais et ils m'ont
          demandé de traduire.

The Inspector answers in English.

                      INSPECTOR
          Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a
          translator will not be necessary.
              (To McKenna)
          Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame?

He stops aside, and wait.

                      INSPECTOR
              (To Drayton)
          Do to the kindness to wait. I might
          have questions for you later.

He motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first,
into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to
the bench, and watches the trio as the office door
closes on them.

He waves the McKenna to chairs, as he goes around behind
his desk and remains standing. Ben and Jo sit down.
The Inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then
holds out his hand.

                      INSPECTOR
              (Precisely)

Ben looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse.
She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them
to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable,
Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The
inspector checks the pictures against the people he
sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports
down on his desk.

                      INSPECTOR
          You entered French Morocco four days
          ago.

                      BEN
          That's right.

                      INSPECTOR
          You are a doctor, monsieur?

                        BEN
          A surgeon.    A tourist, and an American
          citizen.

                      INSPECTOR
          Three good reasons why you should have
          nothing in common with Louis Bernard.

                      BEN
          I didn't have.

                      INSPECTOR
          You were recently in Paris?

                      BEN
          A medical convention.

                        INSPECTOR
          You come to   Marrakesh with him in the
          same bus.    You drank an apéritif with
          him in your   hotel room. And you ate
          at the same   restaurant last night.

                      JO
          But at different tables.

The Inspector's eyes study her briefly, as if her
comment was an unnecessary interruption. Then his
eyes return to Ben.

                      INSPECTOR
          So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to
          you?

                      BEN
          I met him yesterday -- on the bus --
          for the first time in my life.

The Inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen.

                      INSPECTOR
              (ironically)
          And yet -- out of five  thousand people --
          In a great market place  -- he comes to
          you when he is about to  die! Is that
          the action of a casual  acquaintance,
          monsieur?

                      BEN
              (Obstinate)
          I know nothing about Louis Bernard.

                      INSPECTOR
          No? Not even, I suppose, that he was
          an agent of the Déuxieme Bureau?

                      BEN
          What's that?

                      INSPECTOR
          Perhaps you have also never head of
          the American F.B.I.?
              (Sadly)
          It would be so much more easy for both
          of us, monsieur, if you would cease to
          pretend.

                      BEN
          Now, look here...

                      INSPECTOR
              (Patiently)
          The dead man found out what he had
          been sent here to discover. That is
          why he was kill-ed. He told you what
          he had discovered. Why? Because he
          placed complete confidence in you.
          Voila.

                      BEN
          Boy, you not only ask the questions
          you also answer them -- Wait a minute
          let me ask you a question.

                      INSPECTOR
          Indeed, Monsieur?

                      BEN
          Assuming Bernard trusted me as
          implicitly as you say, I would never
          reveal anything he said to me, would
          I?

                      INSPECTOR
          Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes
          find it desirable to betray a
          confidence?

                      BEN
          Let's get something straight. I'm a
          tourist traveling for pleasure. I
          somehow got involved in an unfortunate
          incident. I came down here to make a
          simple statement of fact, and not to
          be subjected to a police grilling.

                      INSPECTOR
          Monsieur, I would like....

                      BEN
              (Interrupting)
          Now hold your horses!   Just hold them.

The door opens suddenly.   The two men look up.

As he speaks, the policeman nods in the direction of
Ben.

The Inspector impatiently tries to dismiss the officer

Ben motions to the policeman to stay where he is

                      BEN
          Wait a minute. A telephone call for
          me?

The policeman at the door looks at the Inspector
briefly. The Inspector is disconcerted, but doesn't
tell the man what to say, so he turns back to Ben and
nods.

He goes out the door, closing it behind him. The
Inspector sits down heavily. Then he looks up at Jo.

The CAMERA PANS Ban as he follows the policeman down
the outside corridor, past Drayton who is still sitting
on a bench and watching Ben somewhat anxiously, and
into a small plain office.


INT. SMALL OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman enters the small office   first. There is
a desk, more like a table, and a phone   is lying on it
off the hook. The policeman picks it    up, and hands it
to Ben. Ben holds it without speaking    a second, and
waves the policeman out.

The policeman is indifferent.    He leaves.   Ben puts
the phone to his ear.

                      BEN

The Arab starts to hang up.

There is an audible click in the receiver held in Ben's
hand.

                         BEN
          Hello.

There is no answer. Ben lowers the phone slightly,
looks at it a minute, then continues on downward with
it, returning the receiver to the phone cradle. He
stands a brief moment in thought, then half turns toward
Drayton sitting in the corridor outside. He motions
to Drayton to join him in the office

                         BEN
          Drayton!

The Englishman gets up and comes into the small office.

                      BEN
          Didn't your wife say she was taking
          Hank straight back to the hotel?

                         DRAYTON
          As I recall.     Why?

Ben picks up the phone, hands it to Drayton.

                      BEN
          Call her. Somebody just threatened me
          about Hank. See if he's all right.

Drayton reacts with surprise, speaks into the Phone.
He speaks French.

INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As Ben enters the office, both Jo and the Inspector
look up him inquiringly.

                      JO
          Who was it, Ben?

Ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the
circumstances. He doesn't sit down. He speaks more
to the Inspector than to his wife, avoiding her eyes.

                      BEN
          It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He
          heard we were being held by the Police
          and thought there was some way he could
          help us.

                      JO
          That was nice of him.

                      BEN
              (Looking at Inspector)
          I told him if we weren't back there in
          fifteen minutes to call the American
          Consulate in Casablanca.

The Inspector has realised that he won't get any more
out of Ben.

                      INSPECTOR
              (charmingly)
          But, Monsieur, if you had only told me
          in the first place, that you wished to
          consult with your consul!

Ben gives him a look.

                      BEN
          Let's go, Jo.

                      INSPECTOR
          There is just one small formality. I
          must request you to sign a statement
          of the facts.

                      BEN
          If it doesn't take too long.

                      INSPECTOR
          But a moment. I will send for a typist.

Reluctantly the Inspector reaches for a phone on his
desk. Jo looks at her husband somewhat puzzled.

                        JO
          Ben...

She holds out her hand more firmly.

          I'm your wife, Ben -- not the police
          inspector. Let's see it.

Reluctantly, Ben takes out the notebook, hands it to
her. Ben watches her as she reads the note he has
written.

The notebook page held by Jo on which Ben has scribbled
Louis Bernard's message. It reads: "A MAN...A

from her and replaces it in his pocket. She stares
ahead, with her own thoughts. Then she speaks.

          and get out of this country as quickly

          the American Consulate -- Why get any
          more involved?

Ben is uncomfortable, and unhappy, but he tries to
hide it. He leans toward Jo as if he's about to tell
her something important. He reaches out, places his
hand over hers.

                      BEN

                      JO
          Frankly, I'm exhausted.    Don't you
          feel well?

He doesn't answer her.    She shrugs, and starts for the
telephone.

                      JO
          I'll call Mrs. Drayton and tell her
          we're back. She can bring Hank up
          here, or I'll go get his.

She picks up the receiver.    Ben speaks without turning
around.

                      BEN
          Jo, hold the call for a minute.

                         JO
          Why?

                      BEN
          Because I asked you to.

She puts the receiver down slowly.    She doesn't like
his manner.

                      JO
          Ben...we're about to have our monthly
          fight.

Ben takes two pills out of a small bottle.      Closes the
bottle, and his medical bag.

                      BEN
          I hope we don't.

                      JO
          Then stop playing Rasputin. I only
          said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.

She reaches for the phone again.    He turns.

                      BEN
          Wait 'til I come back.

She hesitates.   He goes into the bathroom, the CAMERA
PANNING HIM.

She is puzzled with him. Shrugs her shoulders. Slumps
to a sitting position on the bed. She ribs her face
and her eyes with a gesture of fatigue. There is the
sound of running water in the bathroom. When she looks
up again, Ben is standing in front of her. In one
hand he his two capsules, in the other a glass of water.
He holds them out to her. His manner is casual and
pleasant.

                      BEN
          Something to relax you.

She looks at the pills.

                      JO
          I'm so relaxed I'm tired.     You take
          them.

                      BEN
          Jo, they're for you.     I'm the doctor.

                       JO
          Ben...

                      BEN
          You know how you get when things happen --
          tense and upset. Now do me a favor.

She stands up.

                      JO
          Six months ago you told me I took too
          many pills!

                      BEN
          Six months ago you weren't a witness
          to a murder. You've been excited,
          fatigued -- talking a blue streak and
          going around in circles.

                        JO
          I have not.

Ben takes a deep breath.

                      BEN
          Jo, I make my living knowing when and
          how to administer medicine. You'll
          feel a lot better tomorrow if you take
          these today. But you don't think so.
          Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

                      JO
          I'm listening.

                      BEN
          There's something about Louis Bernard,
          the police station, and this whole spy
          business that I haven't told you yet.

He holds out the capsules.

                      BEN
          This is the price of curiosity.

Despite herself she's intrigued.

                      JO
          What could it be?

                      BEN
          There's one way to find out.

She reaches out, takes the capsules, pops them into
her mouth. He hands her the water, she drinks some of
it.

                      JO
          All right, Doctor McKenna.   I am now
          relaxed and listening.


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben moves away from Jo, puts the glass on a dresser.
She sits down on the edge of the bed like a little
girl waiting to hear a bedtime story.

                      JO
          Why don't I call Mrs. Drayton first.
          You can tell me while she's bringing
          Hank up.

                      BEN
          Just a minute. This whole thing strange
          right from the very beginning.

As he talks he moves about the room first one way,
then the other, watching Jo closely, almost as if he
were trying to lull her into sleep, or hypnotize her.

                      BEN
          It was no accident that Louis Bernard
          helped us out on the bus, and struck
          up a conversation. You were right
          about him.

                      JO
          See.

                      BEN
          Yes...yes, you were right about him.
          He was...was strange.

Jo is beginning to appear a little drowsy.   Ben watches
her closely.

                      JO
          I know all that.   Get to the surprise.

                      BEN
          He got talking to us because he was on
          the lookout for a suspicious married
          couple.

                      JO
          Nothing suspicious about us.

                      BEN
          He was wrong. It was a different
          married couple.

                      JO
          And he was killed before he found them.

                      BEN
          No. He found them. In the restaurant.
          Last night. That's why he was killed.

                      JO
          You'll be telling me next it was Mr.
          and Mrs. Drayton!

                      BEN
              (Quietly)
          That's just who it was, Jo.

She rubs a hand over her face.   The drug is taking.

                      JO
          If that's a joke, I don't think it's a
          very funny one.

She stops talking. He looks at her more closely.
Then he walks over to her and sits down on the bed
next to her. He looks at her intensely.

                      JO
          Think I'll lie down.

He prevents her.

                      BEN
          Listen to me. And listen carefully.

She comes awake more, studies him.

                      BEN
          That phone call I received at the police
          station.

She nods dumbly.

                      BEN
          It wasn't from the concierge at the
          hotel. It was from somebody with a
          foreign voice who said if I told anybody
          one word of what. Louis Bernard
          whispered to me in the market place
          that something...something might happen
          to...to, to Hank.

She comes suddenly as awake as she can.

                        JO
          Hank?    Why H... ?

                      BEN
          They've taken him away.

She pushes herself to her feet. She is fighting the
drug successfully. She almost shouts at him.

                      JO
          Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the
          hotel. She is downstairs!

He stands up.

                      BEN
          Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never
          came back here! And Hank didn't either!

                      JO
          Well let's start looking for him.    Mr.
          Drayton...Mr. Drayton should...

He takes hold of her arms.

                      BEN
          Jo, Mr. Drayton, checked out of the
          hotel thirty or forty minutes ago!

She knocks his hands away from her arms in a sudden
violent gesture, and all but screams.

                       JO
          Ben!!   I could kill you!   Sedative!

He reaches for her again.    She hits him away.

                      JO
          All this time you, knew Hank was gone,
          and you wouldn't tell me.

                      BEN
          I wasn't sure, until now.

She is fighting the drug which is beginning to take
over again.

                      JO
          He's my child more than yours!    I had
          him.

He takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely,
trying to get away, to hit him, kick him.

                      JO
          Let go of me! I'll never never never
          forget this! We've got to find Hank!
          We've got to find him.

He struggles silently with her, trying to push her
down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its
work.

                      JO
          You think you're the only one strong
          enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I
          hate you, with my whole heart.
              (She starts to cry)
          Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank!
          Get him, Ben. Please. You damn
          miserable human...how could
          anybody...do...


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

He has forced her down on   the bed, pinioning her arms,
even though her legs still   struggle somewhat. She is
having a hard time seeing,   or talking. Her head waves
back and forth. It's hard    work for Ben to hold her.

Her legs grow quiet. Her arm relax somewhat. She is
still straining to move her head, and talk, but all
that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half
moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a
moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down
against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to
cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts
his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss
on the cheek.

                       BEN
              (Softly)
          Darling, if somebody did this to me,
          I'd say just what you said.


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE MOT

Ben stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on
him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and
covers her up. He brushes back the hair from her
forehead. Then he turns, and the CAMERA PANNING HIM
OVER to the door. He takes one last look at Jo, then
goes out the door, closing it softly behind him.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

As the light of sunset fades into growing darkness,
the muezzin stands atop the minaret, arms raised to
the heavens and giving out his high, sing-song call to
prayer. The call is taken up by another voice somewhere
in the city, and then another, and still another --
until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting
starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then
returning.


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The chant of the call to prayer can be heard In the
background. We are in the single bedroom, of Hank
McKenna. There is one lamp burning over the empty
bed, and another on the wall over the dresser. Ben is
despondently carrying Hank's small suits, and other
articles of clothing from the closet to in open suitcase
on the bed. As he crosses with the final armload of
clothes, he looks out of the door into the large
bedroom.

In the mirror, on the far wall, Ben can see the

to pack them.

We now see Ben's face as he packs his suitcases. Beyond
him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his
direction. He continues to talk, although he finds it
difficult to be matter-of-fact, moving back and forth
from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.

                      BEN
          Both the Draytons are definitely gone.
          The hotel register says they come from
          London. Drayton told the concierge he
          was a college professor. The only
          thing to do now is to get out of
          Marrakesh.

Her face shows a slight rise in reaction, mostly
puzzlement.

                      BEN
          As individuals we're helpless here.
          And because of that phone call, we
          can't bring the police in on it. I
          even thought of taking that chance.

He pauses, and glances at her to see how she reacts.
She just stares at his her eyes a little dull.

                      BEN
          But connect Hank's disappearance to
          Louis Bernard's murder. And the first
          thing they'd do would be to make me
          tell them Louis Bernard's message.
          That...that could be, Hank's...well,
          it wouldn't help him.

Ben goes to take some of Jo's clothes out of drawer,
and comes up with a play script. He looks at it a
moment, then back to Jo. Her eyes observe it, but she
says nothing. Ben continues on to the suitcase, where
he lays the script in with the clothes.

                      BEN
          We're going to London.

She looks a little more sharply as if in question. He
notices as he goes to the dresser for more clothes.

                      BEN
          I found out. The Draytons had a private
          plane -- that's how they took Hank
          back. It could lend anywhere -- no
          question of a passport or anything.

He Packs some more clothes away.   Jo doesn't stir, she
just stares at him.

                      BEN
          So we're going to London to find him.

He looks at her for a reaction. She turns her head
away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting
for control of her emotions. Ben crosses to her, the
CAMERA PANNING him. He sits down on the edge of the
bed, and takes out the small notebook from his coat.
He opens it. In careful, low tones, he reads Louis
Bernard's message.

                      BEN
              (Reading)
          A Man...a statesman...is to be killed...
          assassinated ... in London...soon...very
          soon...tell them...in London...to try
          Ambrose Chappell...
              (Looks up)
          We're going to try this Ambrose Chappell
          and if he has anything at all to do
          with this, I'm going to offer him every
          cent I've got to got Hank back. This
          Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope.
          Understand, Jo?

Jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece
of paper, and all that it contains. Again she turns
her head away. Slowly Ben puts the paper back into
pocket. He speaks with a shade more urgency in his
voice.

                      BEN
          We've only got a few hours, Jo! We
          have to got up and start moving.

Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to  the dresser
and the suitcases. Then he pauses and   looks back at
Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns   back to look
at Ben. She is studying him now as if   she has just
seen him for the first time. Her eyes   are more alert.
Ben turns back to his packing.

                      BEN
          I've paid the bill, and there's a car
          waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack,
          we're leaving.

Slowly Jo gets off the bed, and comes over to Ben.   He
pauses, articles of clothing in his hands.

For a moment she stands there looking at him, and then
impulsively she throws her arms around him and clings
to him. Her anguish is genuine.

                        JO
            Oh Ben, Ben, Ben...where is he?   Where
            is he?

Ben kisses her on the cheek. She buries her head in
his shoulder. Ben stares off into space as if he hopes
to find in answer to her question.

The sober-faced woman, standing among the fans. She
has a rather grey, pasty face, and stares off at Jo
through horn-rimmed glasses that are encrusted with
dust in the corners of the lenses. After a moment she
pushes her way back through the crowd of fans and moves
out of sight.


EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the photographers continue their work Ben and Jo
come down the remaining steps and are joined by a man
wearing ordinary civilian clothes. He takes  a small
black identification folder out of his pocket and holds
it up for their inspection.

                      EDINGTON
          I'm Inspector Edington of the Criminal
          Investigation Department of Scotland
          Yard.

There is immediate alarm in Jo's face, but she then
controls it.

                       BEN
          Yes?   What is it?

                      EDINGTON
          As things are, there's no need for you
          to go through the Customs. Will you
          come this way!

His tone and manner  of asking them leaves little doubt
that his question is  an order. The McKennas glance at
each other briefly.   They realize that this is a further
development of their  involvement.

                      BEN
          Whatever you say.

                       EDINGTON
              (Smiles)
          This Way, please.

He and the airlines official lead the McKennas toward
another entrance to the Airport Building. As she
follows, Jo seems tense and a little scared.


INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The be-spectacled, pasty-faced woman who had been
standing with the fans before, is now speaking rather
cautiously into a telephone. We don't hear what she
is saying, but the inclination of her head shows that
she is making some reference to the new arrivals.


EXT. AIRPORT BUILDING CORRIDOR - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Another man is waiting for them at a door outside the
airport building.

                      EDINGTON
          This is Mr. Woburn -- Doctor and Mrs.
          McKenna.

                      WOBURN
          How do you do?

                      BEN
          Now what do you people want with us?

                      WOBURN
          Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat
          with you, inside.

                      BEN
          Who is Mr. Buchanan?

                      WOBURN

He gestures them to enter the building. They do,
leaving Edington and tho Airline official outside.


EXT. AIRORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Woburn leads Ben and Jo into an inner office.    It is a
good-sized room, plain, but comfortable.

                      WOBURN
          This is Mr. Buchanan -- Doctor and
          Mrs. McKenna.

                      BUCHANAN
          How do you do?

Ben nods to him without speaking.

                      BUCHANAN
          Thank you, Woburn.

Mr. Woburn quietly exits, closing the door behind him.
The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do.

                      BUCHANAN
          Do sit down, won't you?

Jo hesitates, then sits down.    Ben doesn't.

                      BEN
          Why does Scotland Yard want to talk
          with us?

Buchanan sits down behind the desk.    He's sophisticated
and intelligent.

                      BUCHANAN
          Let me say at once, we're shocked...
          that you son was taken from you in
          Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.


EXT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo leans forward quickly, eager, hopeful, unable to
restrain herself.

                      JO
          Do you know where he is?

Ben is somewhat more reserved.

                      BEN
          What about Hank?   What have you heard?

              (O.S.)
          I only wish I could give you some
          cheerful news.

Jo settles back, unhappy, discouraged and a little
resentful of Buchanan. Ben seems irritated by the
disappointment.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Buchanan continues quietly.

                      BUCHANAN
          We might find him. Quite soon, indeed,
          if we work together...Louis Bernard
          was sent to Marrakesh by the French at
          our request to check up on an
          assassination plot -- here, in London.
          A good agent keeps on staking his life.
          He doesn't always win.

Ben and Jo watch Buchanan carefully.

                      BUCHANAN
          Bernard reckoned you were a man to
          trust. He relied on you, to come to
          us.

Jo looks at Ben.   He thinks a moment, but says nothing.

                      BUCHANAN
          Those people kidnapped your boy -- in
          order to keep your mouth shut. That's
          right, isn't it?

                      BEN
          I think they took him for money.

                      BUCHANAN
          Then why didn't you go straight to
          your Consulate in Casablanca? Why did
          you come to London?

Ben is silent.   He can't think of an answer to this
one.

INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Buchanan seem only casually obvious of the exchange.
But he has noted it In his mind.

                      BUCHANAN
          You're convinced that these people
          brought your son to London. You're
          convinced you can find him -- off your
          own bat. You can't. It's impossible.
          But with the help we can give you,
          there's a chance. A really good chance.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Before Ben can stop her, Jo bursts in hotly.

                      JO
          They told us not to say anything!


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Buchanan turns to her and speaks gently, but with force.

                      BUCHANAN
          Anything you tell me will be in the
          most absolute confidence.

Ben starts to interrupt.

                      BEN
          That might be true, but --

Buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him.

                      BUCHANAN
              (To Jo)
          Your son is the trump card these people
          hold. He's perfectly safe -- for the
          moment.

                      JO
          And when they've done what they're
          going to do, they'll let him go. So
          all we have to do is wait.

          No, Mrs. McKenna. If they consider
          the boy a nuisance, afterwards -- I'm
          afraid --

He gestures.

                      BEN
          Now, don't try to frighten us, Mr.
          Buchanan.

                      BUCHANAN
          It's exactly what I'm trying to do --
          frighten you. I'm trying to prevent a
          man being murdered here, in London.

The Pressure on Jo is beginning to weaken her.      Buchanan
persists.

                      BUCHANAN
          If you don't tell me all you know, you
          become an accessory before the fact of
          murder. In English law, you become
          just short of murderers yourselves.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo, a creature of emotion, is bewildered and upset and
tired of fighting Buchanan. She is ready to give in.
She looks to Ben.

                      JO
          Ben, what can we do by ourselves?    We
          need --

          You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr.

          not my wife.

Buchanan turns to Ben.

                      BUCHANAN
          Then you tell me.

                      BEN
          Bernard spoke in French, and I don't
          understand a word of the language.

There is a pause while Buchanan studies Ben.

          And what did you write down on a piece
          of paper?

Ben stands there.   He has no answer.   Jo gets up from
her seat.

                      JO
          Ben -- maybe they could find those
          people, and Hank, before --

                      BEN
              (Interrupts)
          Maybe. Maybe isn't good enough for
          me, and it shouldn't be good enough
          for you.

                      JO
          You act as if you're the only one who's
          concerned about Hank.

                      BEN
          Now Jo, I didn't mean it that way. We
          made up our minds what we were going
          to do -- now let's try to stick to it.

Ben turns to Buchanan.

                      BEN
          We'd like to cooperate with you, Mr.
          Buchanan -- but -- but we just can't.

                      BUCHANAN
              (quietly)
          I have a son of my own.   I don't know
          what I'd do...

Jo looks at Ben appealingly. Even Ben is uncertain
now, trying to evaluate things quickly,

                      BEN
          Well, maybe if we --

He is interrupted by a tapping at the door. Buchanan
looks up, as do the McKennas. The CAMERA PANS Buchanan
to the door as he opens it himself. His assistant
Woburn is there. There is a whispered conversation.
Woburn retreats, and Buchanan turns back to the room.

                      BUCHANAN
              (Matter-of-factly)
          A phone call for you, Mrs. McKenna.

Buchanan crosses and picks up the telephone from the

Jo steps forward, takes the phone hesitantly, looking
at Bon for reassurance.  He nods to her. Buchanan,
meanwhile, has casually, but quickly gone out of the
office, closing the door behind him.

In the outer office Woburn quickly hands Buchanan the

Jo puts the phone to her ear.    She speaks hesitantly.

We hear a voice on filter.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Mrs. McKenna?

                       JO
          Yes.

          This is Mrs. Drayton. You remember
          me?

Jo pales and seems about to faint.

Jo shows some relief, but she's still deeply concerned.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          I expect you'd like to speak to him,
          wouldn't you?

          Yes.    Please, please!

She looks towards Ben.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SH

Ben moves close to her, trying to pick up a little of
the conversation from the phone. She tips the phone a
little in his direction.

                        JO
          Hello.    Hello, Hank?

                      MRS. DRAYTON

          I miss you so much.

more. Ben takes the phone from her quickly.

There is a sudden click. Ben rattles the receiver.
All he gets is a dial tone. He hangs up, and turns to
Jo who is quietly crying, trying to get over the shock
of hearing Hank. Buchanan enters the office as Ben
takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him.
He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She
covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears.
She looks up at Ben.

                      JO
          He was scared.

She starts sobbing soundlessly again, her body shaking.
Ben takes her in his arms to quiet her. She quiets
down slowly. Buchanan standing behind the desk doesn't
look at the pair, but he speaks first.

                      BUCHANAN
          It was a London telephone exchange.

nods for Woburn to leave. Woburn does, casting a side
glance of sympathy toward Jo and Ben. He closes the
door quietly behind him.

Buchanan looks at the pair, and sighs in a manner that
suggests he recognizes defeat, when he sees it.

Jo now has herself under control. She leaves Ben's
arms, and returns to her seat to gather herself
together, dry her eyes. Ben turns to Buchanan.

          You may change your minds.     If you do,

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and
Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the
frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant
porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through
which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of
assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting
to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with
the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and
windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in
the main room, as the McKennas look about.

                      DESK CLARK
          Everything all right, sir?

                        BEN
          It's fine.    Just fine.

                      DESK CLARK
              (Hands Ben key)
          Your room key, Sir.

Ben takes it. The    porters come out of the  bedroom.
Ben reaches in his   pocket, comes up with a  bill, hands
it to one of them.    The porter touches his  forehead in
sort of a salute.    The porters exit. The   desk clerk
follows, pauses at   the door.

                      DESK CLERK
          And I hope you have a most pleasant
          stay in London.

Both Jo and Ben turn to look at him briefly.     He is
smiling, they are not.

                        BEN
          Oh yes.    Thank you.

The desk clerk goes out the door, carefully closing
it. The McKenna are alone. Jo turns to look at the
basket of flowers, and crosses TOWARD THE CAMERA to
look at them. She takes a card in her hand, attached
to the largest basket, reads the note.

          Especially the little--"
              (She breaks off)

JO stands there a brief moment, takes a breath, and
looks at to otter two cards.

          Cindy and Jan.
              (To Ben)
          You don't know Cindy and Jan.


INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA
PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone
and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and
reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins
flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers
and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his
pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis
Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the
notebook to Jo.

                      BEN
          You'd better keep your book.

He returns to the telephone book, after looking at the
note and placing it on the desk in front of him.

                      JO
          What are you looking for?

                      BEN
          The only clue we have which might lead
          us to Hank. The place and identity of
          Mr. Ambrose Chappell.

He finds what is apparently the right page.    His finger
begins to trace down the list of names.

                      INSERT
          Ben's finger going down the column of
          names. "C - C - CHAPPELL - ABRAHAM
          CHAPPELL - A.C. CHAPPELL & CO. ALFRED
          CHAPPELL -- AMBROSE CHAPPELL!!"


INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben pauses, notes the place on the Page, and reaches
for some notepaper and a pen from the desk.

                      BEN
          There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose
          Chappell.

He returns his eye to the book, as Jo leans closer to
watch him. He begins writing down the name and address,
and murmurs half-aloud as he writes --

                      BEN
          Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett
          Street. Camden Town. Telephone -
          Gulliver 6198.

He reaches for the phone, after putting the book to
one side. He lifts the receiver, but Jo reaches out
to stop him. He looks at her with some annoyance.

                      BEN
          Don't you want me to call him?

                      JO
          I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut
          scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do
          the wrong thing.

                      BEN
              (Quietly)
          I'll try not to be too wrong.

He picks up the phone.

                      JO
          What are you going to say?

                      BEN
          I'll offer to keep my mouth shut and
          give him all the money we have -- for
          Hank.
              (To phone)
          Operator. Get me ...
              (Consults address)
          Gulliver 6198. Thank you.

He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud,
but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump
and turn toward the door, almost frightened.

Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're
in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"

                         JO
          I go.

She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming
with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted.
Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four
people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife.
Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life.

The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music
hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five,
more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan
Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age,
smart-looking, but talkative and slightly
scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell
throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.

                       HELEN
          Jo!   You look wonderful!

Val Parnell follows the women in and closes the door
behind him.

                      VAL
          When we got your wire I couldn't believe
          it. What were you doing down in
          Morocco?

                         JO
          Sightseeing.

                      CINDY
          Two minutes later Helen was on the
          phone to me. And I had to call Jan.

                      JAN
          You're the perfect answer to what London
          needs, Jo. This week's the dullest
          thing since my first show.

Jo has disengaged herself from Helen.     Shakes hands
with Val.

                       JO
          Hello,  Val. Jo and I want to thank
          all of  you for the lovely flowers.
          But you  shouldn't have. We might not
          be here  long!

Ben has been watching them anxiously, torn between
hanging up the phone, or waiting for his call to go
through. The call finally comes through.

                      BEN
          Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell?
          Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I
          will...I

He looks up at the group.     They notice him for the
first time.

                      JAN
          Oh hello, Mr. Conway.     Didn't know you
          were there.

              (To Jan with meaning)
          It's McKenna...Doctor McKenna.      Welcome
          to London Town, doctor.

                      JAN
              (Toward Ben)
          Oh, I am sorry.
              (To Jo)
          I knew you were married, but a doctor.
          How clever! Especially in such a
          psychosomatic business. Why --

                      CINDY
          Will you be quiet!

                      JAN
          Cindy!

                      CINDY
          You don't know what psychosomatic means.

                      JAN
          I do too! It means when your mind
          gets sick of your body it does something
          to it --

                      CINDY
          The doctor's trying to talk on the
          phone.

Ben tries to be casual and amiable.

                      BEN
          It's only business.   It's nothing.

Helen Parnell flops into a chair.

                      HELEN
          Business is everything.     Shhh.

They all fall silent, and watch Ben.    He is
uncomfortable.

                      BEN
          Hello?
              (He tries to keep
               voice down)
          Mr. Ambrose Chappell?
              (forced to be louder)
          I said is this Ambrose Chappell?
          ...Well this Mr. McKenna. Uh,...Doctor
          Benjamin McKenna.

He looks at the listening group uncomfortably.

Val Parnell signals silently to her that he can wait
until after the call.

                        BEN
            Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at
            your address for a while? Uh huh,
            it's just some business. Nothing big.
            Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop
            around.


INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Ben hangs up, and turns to the group. He tries to be
as casual as possible. He picks up the note from Louis
Bernard, and the one on which the address of Ambrose
Chappell is written and shoves them into his pocket.
He rises to meet his guests.

                         JAN
            See.   We could have talked.

                         J0
                (Smiles)
            That's what I told you.

                        JO
                (To group)
            I'd like everyone to meet my husband.

Ben volunteers his hand to Val Parnell, while nodding
at Mrs. Parnell.

                        VAL
                (Takes his hand)
            I've heard so much about you, Doctor,
            it's nice to see you in person.

                        HELEN
            You look just like, those pictures Jo
            had in her dressing room four years
            ago. Haven't changed a bit.

                        JAN
            Why should he? He's a doctor.   Probably
            gets free hormones.

Everyone laughs, including Ben and Jo.

                        JO
            And this one is Jan Peterson who sing
            almost as well as I do, but can handle
            those legs like Nijinsky.

          I can believe it.   How do you do, Jan.

                      JAN
          When Nijinsky got off the stage he was
          through with his footwork. That's
          just when mine begins.

Laughter again.

                      JO
          And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful
          expatriate I've ever known.

                      BEN
              (Nods to her)
          Haven't you been home recently?

                      CINDY
          How can I go back to Harrisburg?    They
          know me there as Elva MacDuff
              (Shake's her head,
               pats her wide hips)
          Cindy. It doesn't fit any more.

                      VAL
          Where's your boy? I'd like to see
          which one you he looks like.

All momentary gaiety goes from Jo's face, and Ben has
a hard time appearing nonchalant.

                      BEN
          He -- he's staying with some other
          people -- so we can have a little time
          to ourselves.

                      JAN
          What's his name?

                      JO
              (Tonelessly)
          Hank. Henry, really.

                      CINDY
          I hope he has your looks, and the
          doctor's brains.

Jo turns away toward the flowers.

                      JO
          Thank you again for the beautiful
          flowers.

                      BEN

Jo turns around to look at him, disturbed, almost to
the point of alarm. A carefree dinner is something
she just couldn't go through.

          Room service, please.

          And I wish I could persuade her to
          stay a month.

                      JO
          Oh, Val -- I wish I could, but...

          Will you order the stuff?

He starts toward the door, pausing to pat Jo
comfortingly on the shoulder.

                      BEN
          I'll be back in a little while.

                      HELEN
          Aren't you going to wait for a drink,
          doctor.

                      BEN
          Thank you, but I'll catch up when I
          get back.

Ben starts for the door.

She goes with him to the door.

          I'll never know.

                       BEN
          You can't.   I won't disappear.   Promise.

In the background, the four visitors, while not actually
eavesdropping, are somewhat subdued by the attitude of
the McKennas toward each other.

                      JO
          Ben, for the last time, please let me
          go.

He pats her affectionately on the cheek.

          Two people are much  easier to follow
          than one. We don't   want Buchanan's
          men on our tracks.   Or the other people,
          either. I'm going   out by the service
          entrance --

He turns and goes quickly. She watches him briefly,
then turns back into the room. She tries to assume a
more pleasant face...

LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight
and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and
disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD
THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from,
his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is
completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so
that his footsteps click on the pavement and create
the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the
echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He
slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA.
There is complete silence -- only the faint distant
London traffic noises.

He resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING HIM. The
echo starts again. He slows up again and stops -- but
this time the echo continues. He becomes tense, looks
around in alarm.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The CAMERA PANS the streets from Ben's viewpoint.
There is no sign of anyone.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING  him. He
stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo  -- but the
echo comes on after him. Slightly scared,   he now
resumes his walk with a more hurried pace.   The echo
gets louder. He glances quickly over his   shoulder
again.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

A man is following him, at about the same pace.   He is
rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.

Ben continues walking, and after a bit cautiously
glances behind him.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The same man is following behind.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks
up trying to locate the right house number as he walks.
The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty-
looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that
he would like to make his destination before the man
following catches up with him. Then he changes his
mind. He deliberately slows up.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the
man approaching behind him, listening with the back of
his head, and with his whole body. The man walking
behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him.

Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist
of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that
he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As
the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him
and study him.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches the   man go on ahead of him at a faster
pace. Suddenly    the man turns a sharp right into
doorway, and is   gone. Ben glances at the paper in his
hand. He stops    and looks up in astonishment.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned.
Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE
CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."

Ben hesitates briefly in thought, puts the piece of
paper into his pocket, then makes up his mind and goes
through the doorway.


EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben, rather cautiously, makes his  way  across a small
and somewhat dreary-looking yard,  and  comes to face a
low building at the end of which  is a  kind of small
factory. The door of the factory   is  just closing as
he makes his way across.


EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben pauses at the door to the factory, and looks down
at the pushbutton bell. There is a window next to the
door. Ben bends and peers through the window.


EXT. FACTORY WINDOW - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Staring through the other side of the window is the
snarling, realistic head of a tiger.


EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Startled, Ben recoils instinctively. Then he turns
back to the door, takes a deep breath, braces himself,
and presses the doorbell. The door is soon opened by
a young workman in shirtsleeves and apron.

He opens the door, and Ben enters.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben follows the workman into the shop. It is cluttered
with stuffed animals of every size and shape imaginable.
Lions, tigers, elephant heads, swordfish, crocodiles --
everything. Ben stares around at what he sees. A
number of workmen are busy mounting, stuffing, and
preparing animals for display. The workmen who let
him in calls to someone.

                      WORKMAN
          A sent to see you, sir.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A man, about eighty years old, turns from inspecting a
piece of work, and comes forward to Ben. He is a thin,
gracious, gentle sort of creature.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          Good afternoon, Sir. I am Ambrose
          Chappell.

Ben studies the man briefly. His face shows disbelief
that such a man could be put of an assassination plot.
Chappell stops in front of him, waits a brief moment.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          What can I do for you?

                      BEN
          Well you see, I uh...

There is a twinkle in the old man's eye.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          You gave me your name that might be a
          start.

From behind a doorway on the   far side a man emerge s
in response to the call. He    is somewhat younger than
the first Ambrose Chappell,   but not by much. He is
the fifty-year-old gentleman   who had been apparently
following Ben on the street.    The CAMERA PANS him over
following to his father, and   Ben.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          I think this gentleman wants to talk
          to us.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Now, father. Now why don't you go and
          have a nice rest?

                        CHAPPELL SR.
          Humph!    I have centuries of rest ahead
          of me.

                      (Nods to Ben)
          Good day to you, sir.

Ben nods in return, and the elder Chappell returns to
whatever he was doing when Ben entered.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Now what can I do for you?

Ben turns his attention back to the son.    He is now a
little more in command of himself.

                      BEN
          I'm Doctor Mckenna.
              (He waits, no
               reaction)
          Does the name mean anything to you?

Chappell Jr. thinks for a moment.    The name obviously
doesn't register.

                      CHAPPELL
          I don't think so.

A widor angle of the shop. Workmen pause in their
work to look in the direction of Ben with some
curiosity.

Chappell Jr. nods his head, but waits with a deadpan
expression for Ben to continue. After a pause, Ben
does.

                      BEN
          You have no idea why I came here?

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          My dear sir, I haven't the faintest
          idea!

Ben's expression shows that he feels Chappell is putting
up a thorough bluff, but he still goes on.

                      BEN
          I was given your name by someone I
          happened to meet in Marrakesh.

Chappel Jr.'s expression doesn't change, except for a
slightly raised eyebrow.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Oh, yes?

Ben now has the feeling he's on to the right man.

                      BEN
          I suppose you've heard of him.    Louis
          Bernard. A Frenchman.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Louis Bernard?

He seems to be turning the name over in his mind.    Ben
turns to at the workmen around them.

The workmen half-listening, return to their work on
the various animals. They are a bit self-conscious at
being observed eavesdropping.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben turns back to Chappell Jr. He moves in a little
closer, and drops his voice somewhat. Chappell Jr.
watches him warily.

                      BEN
          Let's stop fencing with words, huh?
          Bernard told me to come here, just
          before he died.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          This man is...dead?

                      BEN
          You know it as well as I do. Now I
          came to make a business proposition.
          And I don't see how you can turn it
          down.

Ambrose Chappell looks over to a man stuffing animal's
corpse.

                      CHAPPEEL JR.
          What did you have in mind?

                      BEN
          You want to talk here?

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Certainly. We have no secrets from
          our employees.

                      BEN
          Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered
          one word of what Bernard told to before
          he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm
          not interested in political intrigue,
          and I don't care who it is you're going
          to kill here in London. All I want is
          that boy, and I'll get on the first
          plane for America.

When Ben begins mentioning a killing, Chappell Jr's
face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. He moves
back from Ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. Ben,
however, now convinced that he has the right man in
front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.

                      BEN
          Now that isn't all.   If money will do
          anything...

Chappell Jr. now seems thoroughly frightened. He moves
back from Ben, almost stumbling. He turns, goes back
to the door of a small office, in which is now standing
Chappell Sr.

Chappell Sr. leans closer to the open door, as the son
speaks urgently and sotto Voce to him.

          Father -- phone the police!   Quick!

Chappell Jr. now turns back toward Ben, trying to assume
a pleasant and casual manner.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Now, sir -- shall we go into this a
          little more carefully? You said
          something about money?

Workmen are pausing in their work to look at the pair,
wondering at the mention of money.

                      BEN
          You told him to call the police.   Now
          don't try to bluff me like that!

He reaches out quickly, grabs Chappell jr. by the label.
The man gives an involuntary cry of fear.

          at once?
               (Glancing toward
                him)
          There's is an extraordinary individual

          I've never heard of him.

                      BEN
          And you don't have any idea what went
          on in Marrakesh yesterday, or where my
          boy is?

          No, of course not! Edgar!   William!
          Davis! Help!

Ben lets go of Chappell Jr., and turns in confusion.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The workmen drop their tools, and move in on Ben quickly
and threateningly. Even Chappell Sr. comes out of the
office in alarm. Ben backs away toward the door.

                      BEN
          Now just a minute. Take it easy. I
          obviously got the wrong place. Now
          stay away from me.

But they don't. They come on. Ben looks quickly around
for a weapon, or an exit. He sees the door, and moves
quickly toward it, but the workmen are faster than he
is. Two of them bar the exit. Ben tries to shove
them out of the way and get through the door. The men
grapple with him. Chappell Jr., himself, and another
workman rush in, endeavoring to subdue Ben. A silent,
but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete
melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold
him down.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Hold him...hold him...till the police
          come.

Ben breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another
escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past.
But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They
twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted
animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish,
and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in
his struggles comes face to face with the angry head
of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself
at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object
somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches
himself free.

up his fallen hat and dashes out again.


INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting
around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She
seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val
Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her
disinterest.

                      VAL
          ...and back at our flat, after the
          first night, Chris had the nerve to
          suggest that the sketch where Bud
          Flanagan comes in dressed up as the
          Countess was unconvincing ... that no
          matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan
          was, even if he were dressed by
          Hartnell, nobody would believe he was
          an aristocrat. So I said, 'Look Chris,
          why don't you cut William Hickey's
          column out of the paper?! --

He stops talking, as he looks across at the silent Jo.
Helen and the others, follow his look. They watch her
sympathetically. Jo  seems totally unaware that anyone
else is in the room, staring, into thin air, absorbed
with thoughts of her own.

                         VAL

She doesn't answer, so he goes on.

          No.   No...you mean Chappell!

She rises from her chair with some excitement.    She
murmurs, almost to herself:

crosses to a table, takes her purse. She hurries to
the door without a word; then turns to them.

She hurries out the door. The others are left standing,
looking at each other. Val and Helen speak almost at
the same time, asking each other the same question.

Val paces thoughtfully, and they watch him.

                      VAL
          It must be a now American gag.    I'll
          ask Danny about it.

At that moment the door suddenly opens. Everyone turns
in surprise. Ben is standing in the doorway. He comes
slowly into the room, closing the door. He is very
tired looking, and disheveled. They watch him enter
silently.

Val walks over to him, hands him a ready-made drink.
Ben takes it but doesn't have time to drink when Val
speaks.

young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the

autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with
the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has
caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious
satisfaction jumps three of her men.

                        HANK
          I guess so.

                      EDNA
          Hurry up if you want to finish this
          game.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Look it doesn't hurt to be kind. Yell
          out when you want me to open the door.

Edna studies the board with a frown.   Mrs. Drayton
smiles and goes out the door.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

In the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door,
and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She
enters another door.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA
PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting
on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the
McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for
someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and
tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped
underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word,
sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with
something close to fatigue. Then she speaks.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          I wish it was tomorrow.

Drayton turns, having finished his dressing.

                       DRAYTON
              (Coldly)
          That's not a very orthodox sentiment.

He goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer.
It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the
gun.

                       DRAYTON
          Two excellent tickets for the concert
          at the Albert Hall -- with my
          compliments.

He hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances
at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket.

                      DRAYTON
          Your box is nicely placed, or shall we
          say strategically placed.

He goes to a portable record player, which is open and
has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph.

                      DRAYTON
          Now for the most important part.

He gestured towards the record.

                        RIEN
          What is it?

                      DRAYTON
          A record of the delightful Picco they
          will play tonight.

                      RIEN
          What about it?

                      DRAYTON
          Music is less in your line than
          marksmanship. If you will listen, my
          friend, I will play for you the exact
          moment at which you can shoot. Now
          listen carefully.

Drayton plays the record.

                      DRAYTON
          Let me do it for you again.   Now listen
          for the cymbal crash.

Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands
together at the cymbal crash.

                      DRAYTON
          You see at such a moment your shot
          will not be heard. The listeners will
          not even be disturbed. I think the
          composer would have appreciated that.
          No one will know.

                      RIEN
          None except one you mean.

The assassin smiles.

                      DRAYTON
          Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend.
          Any questions musical or otherwise?

                        RIEN
          No.

                      DRAYTON
          There's's one comforting thought. It
          happens early in the evening. I hope
          I won't upset you if I say there's
          time for one shot only. If you need
          another, the risk is yours.

                      RIEN
          I do not take risks.

                      DRAYTON
          That's a comfort -- traipsing all the
          way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I
          should like you to do me credit.

He looks at his watch.

                      DRAYTON
          Your distinguished target's on the way
          there now. A car is waiting for you
          downstairs at the back entrance. You
          will pick up a Miss Benson on your
          way. She will be your companion in
          the box. She's there to lend an air
          of respectability...if that's possible.

                      RIEN
          You will have the money when I return?

                      DRAYTON
          I think you can trust me.

                      RIEN
              (Looking him up and
               down)
          What is your English proverb -- a wolf
          in Sheep's clothing?

Drayton laughs.

                         DRAYTON
          I think you    had better be going. It
          is impolite    to be late for a concert.
          It would be    awkward if they made you
          wait until    the first selection is over.

He turns to his wife.

                      DRAYTON
          See him downstairs, my dear.
              (To Rien)
          I'm sorry you must sneak out the back
          way, but we have to preserve our
          respectable front.

She exits with the assassin.    Drayton turns to the
mirror and surveys himself.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. REAR ENTRANCE AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY)

In the distance Jo is seen pacing. To rear door of
the chapel opens and Mrs. Drayton pushes Rien out. He
crosses and enters a waiting car. The car drives off.

EXT. AMBROSE STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The shadows of the day are lengthening as Ben gets out
of a taxi and approaches Jo standing on the sidewalk.
His fatigue of before seems to have vanished in his
eagerness to meet Jo and find out what she knows.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben comes up to her.   She grips his hands.

                         JO
          There it is.

                      BEN
          You may have just hit it right on the
          nose. You can't be farther wrong than
          I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let's
          go.

                      JO
          Ben, should we get some help from the
          police?

                      BEN
          No, honey, please, no -- let's take a
          crack at this alone.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The Chapel as seen from their viewpoint. People are
now entering it, but it seem as if the tag end of the
congregation is entering, because the service is
obviously under way, the sound of hymn singing coming
across faintly to us.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately.
Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING
them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM   SHOT

They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around
cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds
about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist
type and the congregation consists mostly of middle-
aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not
aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other
than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport,
and later took care of Hank.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row
seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to
look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something
to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks
up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and
begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of
following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own
words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at
the chapel.

                      BEN
              (singing)
          This looks like mother wild goose chase.

                      JO
              (Singing them)
          Let's wait and look around...

Some of the parishioners turn and listen to Jo's voice
because it has a professional quality that rises above
the rest. Whether they are watching her in suspicion,
or admiration, is hard to tell. Jo turns her attention
to the hymn book, trying to be unnoticed. Ben's eyes
catch something coming down the aisle.

                      BEN
              (Singing)
          Look who's coming down the aisle.

Jo follows his glance, leaning forward a little and to
one side.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Coming up the aisle with a collection basket, collecting
money during the hymn is Mrs. Drayton. She is
approaching the row in which the McKennas are standing.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is
between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben
immediately eases his way along behind a column which
hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the
side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall
woman in front of her, but she is not entirely
successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to
them.

Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs.
Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes
forward her collection plate, and as she does so her
face blanches. She instantly identifies the two.
Ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the
eye and puts some coins into her plate.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As the astonished Mrs. Drayton turns to go back down
the aisle with her plate of coins and bills, we now
see the surpliced Mr. Drayton ascending the pulpit.
He looks down to his wife.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

From Mr. Drayton's viewpoint, as he notices his wife
coming up the aisle with a startled expression on her
face. She tries to  nod with her head to indicate
something important lies behind her.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Mr. Drayton, trying to puzzle out her alarm, studies
her face, and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her.
The expression on his face leaves no doubt that he
cannot understand what she's trying to convey. The
hymn has come an end, and the congregation starts
seating itself.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as
yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front
of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his
pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right
one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls
silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his
sermon.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain
page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is
sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at
him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the
pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something
out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and
begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.

                       DRAYTON
          Brothers and Sisters: The subject of
          my address this evening is adversity.
          The average life, yours and mine, is
          often harassed and perplexed by
          cruelties and disappointments beyond
          our control.

Strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our
control which help to make us better beings.

Pain and tribulation are the testing ground of   life
and let us be grateful for them. Let us bless    the
disappointments and the frustrations and say a   prayer
for the agony of the moment. Only thus shall    we confirm
and re-confirm our own goodness and therefore   the
essential goodness of all Mankind.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon.
Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered.

                      BEN
          That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on
          out and call him and ask him to surround
          the place with police.

                      JO
          What if he asks me...

                      BEN
          Tell him...tell him everything. This
          is the time. I'm sure Hank is around
          here some place.

                      JO
          Ben, I don't want to leave you.

                      BEN
          I don't know how else to do it, honey.

Ben gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at
him, she slides out of the seat.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

In the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He
almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her
seat.

The chapel as seen from Drayton's viewpoint. Jo has
turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious.
Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon,
shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph.

                      DRAYTON
          Few of us pause to think how life's
          adversities work in our behalf, to
          make better men and women of us.

                      DRAYTON (CONT'D)
          But I believe we should pause now to
          do a little stock-taking -- to look
          into our own hearts and see what we
          find there. Therefore instead of
          continuing the service, I think we
          should all return to our homes for
          private meditation, remembering how
          little we have to complain of and how
          much to be grateful for. Next week I
          shall discuss the fruits of our
          meditation. Until then, my blessing
          upon each and every one of you.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart.
There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells
them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from
the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The
members rise from their seats and begin filing out of
the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances
toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have
heard.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he
beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers
something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to
him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton
goes off through a side door by the altar, while the
organist makes her way down the aisle through the
congregation to stand by the door.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through
the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the
front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow
and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel,
Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets
him with bland amiability.

                      DRAYTON
          Well this is a pleasant surprise,
          Doctor.

                      BEN
          Where's my boy, Drayton?

                      DRAYTON
          He's upstairs. As a matter of fact
          you've just come in time to help my
          wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank
          doesn't care much for English cooking.

Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he
talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows
it cautiously. But before he can confirm his
suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing
that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has
just closed the door, and is in the process of locking
the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts
the key and puts it into her pocket.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has
changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat
of his robes.

                      BEN
          What do you want? I'll give you money
          and keep my mouth shut. All I want is
          my boy.

                      DRAYTON
          And what about your wife? Did she go
          outside just to get some fresh air.

                      BEN
          Tell me what you want.   I'll do
          anything.

                      DRAYTON
          All right -- you'll see your boy in
          good time.

With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from
Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses
it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens
and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly
to face them, backing of a little.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and
the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves.
Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind
them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and
suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone
can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the
microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon.
He yells into it.

                     BEN
          Hank! Hank McKenna!    Hank!   Where are
          you? Hank! Hank!

As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash
for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly
off, the voice of Hank:

                       HANK
          Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad -

His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit
in an effort to make for the open door, but the two
men throw themselves on top of him.

Woburn, assistant to Buchanan, is listening intently
on the phone. The office behind him is not handsomely
appointed. Jo's voice is heard on filter.

          He sent me out to call you -- so we
          could do something before they get
          away.

                      WOBURN
          I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe
          your son is somewhere in the chapel?

                      JO
          I don't know, I don't know where he
          is...but at least these people will
          know -- the Draytons. If you'd only
          send somebody to get them.

          waiting for me to bring some help.
          Can't I talk with Mr. Buchanan? He

another phone with his left hand, and dials a number
as he talks to Jo.

                       WOBURN
               (Efficiently)
           That won't be necessary. I'll see
           that the chapel is put under immediate
           observation. By the time you get back
           a police car should be there. Please
           return to your husband, tell him to
           come straight out of the chapel, and
           let the police take over.

He turns to the other phone.

                       WOBURN
           Woburn, Special Branch, hold on.

          Yes, but something's wrong. A few
          minutes ago the place was full of
          people, and now there's nobody!

Two of the police move up toward the Chapel.    Patterson
glances at it.

                      PATTERSON
          Our orders are to keep it under
          observation until a Scotland Yard car
          arrives.

                      JO
          My husband's in there. There must
          have been thirty or forty people...
          and now...

Patterson looks at her carefully.

                      PATTERSON
          When was this?

                      JO
          It couldn't...it couldn't have been
          more than five minutes ago!

                      PATTERSON
              (Interrupting)
          Let's take a look.

                      JO
          I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.

          I tried that. It's looked, Let's force
          it open.

                      PATTERSON
          I'm sorry, madam, we can't break in.
              (Sympathetic)
          Requires a search warrant. It's the
          law, you see.

                      JO
          Couldn't you get one?

                      PATTERSON

          round, shall we? Matthews, you take

                      MATTHEWS
          There's no one there, sir.

                      PATTERSON
          Are you quite certain the place was
          full of people -- only a few minutes
          ago?

                      JO
          Of course I'm certain. I was there
          myself, sitting next to my husband.
          He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.

He looks at her quizzically.

                      J0
          It's much too complicated to explain.

                      PATTERSON
          We'll just have to sit tight and wait
          for the car to arrive from the Yard.

He starts for the front of the Chapel, and Jo,
unhappily, is forced to follow.

The chapel is deserted inside. In the dim light we
can see a form stretched out on the floor. It is Ben.
He begins to stir a little as if just beginning to
come to after being knocked unconscious.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The policemen are grouped around the patrol car, as
Patterson, the sergeant, talks over a radio telephone.

                      PATTERSON
          So far as we can make out, sir, there's
          no sign of life. I see, very good,
          Sir.

He hangs up, and gets out of the open car.    He turns
to one of his men.

                      PATTERSON
          Walden, you'll stay here, till the car
          arrives from the Yard.

Jo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a
moment and makes a sudden decision.

                      JO
          Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.

Patterson looks at her with tolerant surprise.

                      PATTERSON
          Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our
          beat. Suppose we drop you at the
          nearest taxi rank?

Jo looks back at the Chapel briefly.

                       JO
          All right.   Let's go.

now remains deserted.


EXT. EMBASSY - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The exterior rear of a huge residential building such
as is to be found in Kensington Palace Gardens or
Belgrave Square. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see a
Humber car driving through the gates at the rear. It
pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside
the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are
the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry
to the door of the kitchen and enter.


INT. EMBASSY KITCHEN - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

There is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of
middle-age, all preparing food for what is obviously a
big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to
get their attention.

                       GUARD
          Hello.   Hello.

The work falls quiet as they become aware of him.

                      GUARD
          Everybody out into the corridor.   Hurry
              (He claps his hands)

There is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The
man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers
some words to him. The butler turns to the workers
and starts herding them toward the corridor through a
door in the far corner of the kitchen.

                      BUTLER
          Do what he says. Come on. It will
          only be a minute. Come on, all of you --
          out.

The man goes to the door.

          This embassy -- there's always something
          queer going on.


INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

While the other servants are grumbling, one is saying
nothing. He rather a Shrewd-looking young footman.
He strains to listen through closed door. Coming from
the kitchen are several sounds. A door opening, the
walking of feet, and finally the slam of a door.

                      ANOTHER VOICE
          Bringing people in, in secret...

                      ANOTHER VOICE
          Give me the Swiss Embassy every time,
          there's neutrality for you!

Then the sound of a car leaving outside. The door to
the kitchen opens and the servants, including the young
footman enter again.

The young footman, among the first to enter, surveys
the kitchen. There is no sign of anyone having passed
through.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The street before the chapel is still deserted, and
the light of day is beginning to fade. Suddenly the
silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing
spasmodically in the chapel belfry. Along the street
a few people begin putting their heads out of windows,
and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying
away down the street.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Inside the chapel we can see the cause of the spasmodic
bell ringing. Ben is using  the rope to climb out of

EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

Shooting through the Albert Memorial as a foreground
piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big
concert. Through the archway large limousines are
pulling up, while on the sidewalk level with the main
road odd taxis are pulling in. We see the usual line
of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.


EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces
for that evening the commemorative concert. Further
details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be
sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal
Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo
soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the
CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near
enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the
door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far
side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note.
She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after
her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks
at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner
recesses of his clothes.

South American beauties.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

Shooting down from the stone-stepped, cast-iron
railinged staircase we see the milling people going
off in different directions to their seats. There is
a hubbub of voices through which we can hear the
programme sellers crying out their wares.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people,
perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other
people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time
because they had no money, take their turns at the
window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this
queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the
queue.

                      UNIFORMED ATTENDANT
          Seats at a guinea. Starting Room three
          and six --

          I would like to see the manager, please.

sees:

Shooting over the head of crowd she sees the arrival
of an important personage. He is accompanied by others
who are apparently attendants upon him. A couple of
the individuals behind him are wearing large order
sashes underneath their white waistcoats. The principal
figure of this group is an oldish an around sixty. He
is in white tie and tails, and also wearing a number
of foreign orders. About third is line behind him
comes 'Buchanan'.

possibly the manager of the Albert Hall, his assistant
cow-towing behind him, and alongside of the manager
someone dressed like he might be 'Sir Kenneth Clarke',
the head of the Arts Council, The new-arrival is
greeted. There is an exchange of courtesies, after
which they are led on toward the beginning of the
staircase. As 'Buchanan' comes nearer.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Jo tries to push her way through towards him. The
people around her resent her efforts. Behind Jo are
two girls in their early twenties. Both are Chelsea
types.

                      1ST GIRL
              (Bored)
          Is that the Prime Minister?

The CAMERA PANS Jo as she does manage to get forward a
little, but she is caught up in the Sudden break-up of
the people who have lined up to see arrival. By the
time she is in the clear the CAMERA PANS her further
and over her shoulder we see the last of 'Buchanan'
and the rest up the staircase, followed by other members
of the audience going up in the same direction.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - CLOSE UP

We see Jo's frustration filling her face. She begins
to turn her head. She looks down with indecision.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

In the foreground are passing people hurrying towards
their seats. There, taking a step forward and staring
in Jo's direction, is Rien, the Assassin. His face
shows considerable alarm at what he sees.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - MEDIUM. SHOT

From his viewpoint Jo is   half-turned in his direction.
Her head is still down.    Slowly she looks up. Her
mouth half-opens when she   sees the man she once saw in
the corridor of the hotel   at Marrakesh.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Rien, with a quick thought, hurries over to her.

He turns to go.   Jo clutches him and almost cries out.

                         J0
          Where Is he?     Where is he?

Rien does not reply. The CAMERA PANS him away. We

The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we now see that the crowd in
the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled
by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we
can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed
by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which
obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary
in his box.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Jo stares toward the opening into the hall. She seems
drawn to go in. She crosses and the CAMERA FOLLOWS
her to the first entrance to the outer corridor.

          Your ticket, madam?

Jo shakes her heads.

                       JO
          If you don't mind, I'm just looking
          for someone.

She takes a step or two forward as some new arrivals
take up the attention of the ticket collector. The
programme girl escorts them out of the scene.

and arms folded, on a chair, and beside him on another
chair, the cymbals.

The inert cymbals resting on their chair.


INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

From her viewpoint we see Rien is raising a pair of
small black leather opera glasses which he puts to his
eyes and studies his target.


INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitary's box.
He is turning to the man beside him, whom we shall
later know as the Ambassador, and indicates with
gestures how much he is enjoying the concert. He looks
back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and
comments to 'Buchanan'. Then, turning forward, he
settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT

Through the doors we see a taxi pulling away and
presently a glass door opens and a dishevelled Ben
comes into the lobby. He comes up to the CAMERA and
looks about him.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT

From his viewpoint the lobby appears empty except
perhaps for a solitary uniformed policeman.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben look the other way and upstairs.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint the other direction -- just
emptiness.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - CLOSEUP

We see Ben's bewilderment as to what to do and where
to go. We PAN him up to the first corridor entrance
that leads to the main circular corridor. Ben enters.
His face lights up.


INT. CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint we see through the opening the ticket
collector and the program girl standing at the opening
leading down the main aisle. On the right, standing
with her back to him, is Jo.

INT. HALL - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he hurries forward. He touches
Jo lightly on the shoulder. She turns, startled, and
manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him. We
do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime
we see that Jo is telling Ben all about the impending
shooting. Ben argues with her. He indicates he will
tell Buchanan. She frantically restrains him but he
shakes her off and dashes away.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see Ben ascending the stairs originally taken by
the dignitary and his group.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben comes into the corridor and looks about him. Beyond
him we see a group of men obviously detectives, and
ahead of them a police constable. We see Ben hurry in
his direction.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him
when he is stopped. We again do not hear the dialogue,
but the pantomime shows that Ben is trying to get to
Buchanan. The constable doesn't quite know what to
make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he
must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as
the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who
is standing in a small group a little way off. From
his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the
Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's
direction.


INT. HALL - (DUSK) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo, looking over her shoulder and then up to the box
of the dignitary. She turns desperately towards the

The Inspector is turning to Ben, the Constable on one
side. Again in pantomime the Inspector questioning
the impatient Ben. He leaves Ben and goes over to the
men standing outside the door to the box. Ben half-
turns away with exasperation toward the CAMERA.

them unfolds his arms and uncrosses his legs. He leans
forward to glance at his  score.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben is still waiting for the Inspector to discuss
matters with the plainclothesman. He turns and hurries
away, the CAMERA PANNING him.

In the orchestra, the cymbal player now places one
hand on the cymbals on the chair.


INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

In the box the Assassin places his hand for the   first
time inside his coat towards his holster. The    CAMERA
PULLS BACK to show the woman sitting with him,   seeing
this gesture, rising and backing away into the   dark
recesses of the box.

up the cymbals.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

A closer view of Ben shows him trying another door
cautiously and surreptitiously. He looks in and then
softly closes the door. He moves further along and
tries another door with the same cautious movement.

The Assassin now has his gun out in the darkness of
the rear of the box.


INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The CAMERA SWIFTLY MOVES IN to the bottom of the right-
hand page showing the one note he is to strike.


INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Jo becoming more anxious and desperate. She looks up

INT. ASSASSIN'S BOX - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see the Assassin fall with a crash into the aisle
below him as Ben dashes forward in the box.

We see Ben hurrying down the stairs. Jo rushes into
the lobby and, seeing Ben, dashes towards him.

A few of the people around the lobby begin to look at
Jo and Ben. We see the Assistant Manager hurry over
to them. They are in a group of three, and although
we do not actually hear what he says, due to the hubbub,
he is obviously questioning Ben and being solicitous
to Jo.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the
conversation. Ben is just saying:

                      BEN
          Then he didn't kill him?

                      ASSISTANT MANAGER
          Your wife saved him -- it is only a
          small flesh wound...Oh here he is
          now...you must come and meet him...don't
          be nervous...I'll get the aide to
          present you...it will be all right
              (To Woburn)
          Would you present the lady to the prime
          minister?

Suddenly their attention is drawn to something off-
screen up the stairs. The hubbub increases.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister,
obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate,
being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other
members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special
Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and
obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating
their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather
over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the
stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.


INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

'Buchanan' is reassuring the Ambassador.

                      BUCHANAN
          I'll report to you fully at the Embassy,
          Your Excellency. In the meantime...


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The manager is leading Ben and Jo across to the foot
of the stairs. They are reluctant but he insists. As
the CAMERA PANS them over they meet the group at the
bottom at the stairs. The manager calls out to Mr.
Woburn and indicates Ben and Jo.

Woburn is a little non-plussed.  He leans over to one
of the Prime Minister's Aides.  The latter's face lights
up. He leans over and whispers  something to the Prime
Minister. The Prime Minister is  all smiles.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Woburn steps down and introduces Ben and Jo to the
Prime Minister's Aide.

                      WOBURN
          Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady
          who --

The Prime Minister interrupts enthusiastically.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          My dear lady, I shall be for ever in
          your debt.

                      WOBURN
          And this is her husband --

The Prime Minister interrupts again, less
enthusiastically.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          A pleasure, my dear sir...
              (He turns to Jo)
          I trust you will permit me to wait
          upon you tomorrow and to express the
          depth of my gratitude.

                       JO
              (Weakly)
          It wasn't -- it wasn't --

                      PRIME MINISTER
              (Gallantly)
          Oh but it was, my dear lady.

There is an awkward pause.  The Prime Minister collects
himself and turns to move on out of the hall, the police
making a passageway for him through the crowd. We see
the Ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving
across the screen quickly to follow the Prime Minister.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben and Jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do
or where to go next. Woburn standing with Ben and Jo.

          talk to you.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From their viewpoint a grim 'Buchanan' is standing at
the top of the stairs.


INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The CAMERA PANS Ben and Jo up the stairs towards
'Buchanan'. They increase their pace towards him.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

When they reach him they have only one thought in their
minds to ask him.

                       JO
              (Wildly)
          Where's our boy?   Where's Hank?

                      BUCHANAN
              (quietly)
          We can talk if you'll come in here.

The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and
to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various
police standing about and some of Special Branch men
can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside
too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in.
The door closes behind them.


INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The three of them enter the 'Green Room', generally
used by the principal Artistes appearing at Royal Albert
Hall. Buchanan nods to two Special Branch men who are
standing about in case they are needed. The room is
informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of
small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest
chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in
a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he
expects him to say something. Ben responds to the
look.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Coldly)
          So you both know the time and place
          all along.

                      BEN
              (Roughly)
          Don't be a fool.

                      BUCHANAN
          An odd coincidence -- both of you
          turning up here.

                       BEN
              (Coldly)
          Too bad you didn't contact your
          assistant. He sent us both here.

                      BUCHANAN
              (Quickly)
          I beg your pardon.

                      BEN
          You see, we finally needed that help
          you offered. We still need it.

                      JO
              (Urgently)
          Yes, Mr. Buchanan.     We still need it.

The door opens and another member of the Special Branch
enters.

                      DETECTIVE
          Sir?

Buchanan nods to him to speak.

                      DETECTIVE
          We've questioned the woman. Said she
          bought a ticket that happened to place
          her in the same box with the man that
          did the shooting. Doesn't know anything --
          but if she does, she's not talking.

                      BUCHANAN
          I'll see her later.

                      DETECTIVE
          Very good, sir.

The Detective exits as Ben sits down dejectedly in a
chair.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Gently)
          Please tell me everything, now.
          Everything.
              (go turns to Jo)
          There's still plenty of room for hope,
          Mrs. McKenna...

ballroom.

As yet the room is about quarter filled and various
guests of the Diplomatic Corps and others are gradually
adding to the group. The CAMERA DOLLIES DOWN over
them until it reaches slightly open doorway. Peering
cautiously through we see the face of Drayton.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

On the other side of the doorway is Drayton and his
wife. She is pacing nervously behind him. A footman
comes up to them and announces:

                         FOOTMAN
             His Excellency will see you now.

Drayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them
after the footman across a small hallway. He is the
very same footman we saw among the group of servants
who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door
in front of the Draytons -- they enter.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an
oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador
whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.

                         AMBASSADOR
             Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman
             won't talk, she won't talk and that's
             that, I suppose. All right.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton
advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner,
the CAMERA PANNING him.

                          DRAYTON
                 (Easily)
             Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain
             to you -- something very unusual has
             happened. I must also have the money
             to pay our French marksman.

                         AMBASSADOR
                 (Almost casually)
             Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering
             that he's dead?

Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador.
They are staggered at this news.

                      AMBASSADOR
          His aim wasn't quite as good as you
          led me to expect. The target merely
          received a slight flesh wound in the
          arm. Worse than useless.

Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.

                      AMBASSADOR
          Then your French friend panicked, and
          made a fatal crash -- landing on the
          floor of the Albert Hall.

                       DRAYTON
              (Blustering weakly)
          I don't see how you can hold me
          responsible. He was most warmly
          recommended by our people in
          Marrakesh...

The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.

                      AMBASSADOR
          I'm glad you're able to treat the matter
          so lightly. I am holding a reception
          here this evening. In a few minutes,
          I have to welcome our Prime Minister
          as my guest of honor -- when I hope
          and expected that he would be totally
          unable to attend. That amuses you, no
          doubt?

                       DRAYTON
              (Feebly)
          I don't know what to say ...

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Brutally)
          No. But I do. You've muddled
          everything from the start. Kidnapping
          that child in Marrakesh...Don't you
          realize that Americans dislike having
          their children kidnapped?

                       DRAYTON
              (Trying to keep his
               end up)
          How else could I make sure the American
          would hold his tongue?

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Ignoring this)
          And then, to crown it all, you get
          cold feet and come running along here
          to hide -- and bring the child with
          you: Don't you see what you've done to
          the diplomatic status of this Embassy?

                      AMBASSADOR

          How are you going to get the child out

          With plain-clothes detectives planted
          right round this building?
              (Wryly)
          You English intellectuals will be the
          death of us all.

                      DRAYTON
              (Desperate)
          I'll think of some method.   Just give
          me time....

                       AMBASSADOR
              (He snorts
                Contemptuously)
          Time!

The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage,
and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking
about something.

                      AMBASSADOR
          I want the child removed from this
          Embassy, and removed in such a way
          that he won't be able to say any more
          where he has been tonight.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Oh, no!

The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a
manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say
something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth.
Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible
servility.

                      DRAYTON
          Right, I'll see to it..

Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There
is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

                           AMBASSADOR
          Come in.

The door opens and a butler enters.

                      BUTLER
          Your Excellency, the Princess should
          be arriving at any moment.

The Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a
little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the
room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra
in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The
Ambassador goes out of the door.        Mrs. Drayton is
looking down at the floor.


INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Ben is talking.    Buchanan is listening carefully.

                      BEN
          ...recognized him, and he recognized
          me. So he jumped for it. And that is
          all.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Slowly)
          Trying to liquidate one of their own
          big-shots. I wish they'd stick to
          their usual custom, and do it in their
          own country...

At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re-
placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks
up the telephone.

                       WOBURN
          Hello.
              (He listens for a
               moment)
          Hold on.

He turns the telephone over to Buchanan.

                      BUCHANAN
              (To phone)
          Buchanan speaking.

Buchanan listens for a while, his face changing as he
listens with increased interest.

                           BUCHANAN
          Right.    Bye.

Buchanan hangs up, turns to Woburn, but half speaks in
the direction of the McKenna's.

                      BUCHANAN
          The Draytons are at the Embassy.

                      JO
          How do you know?

                      BUCHANAN
          We have ways of finding out -- from
          the inside.

Ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair.

                      BEN
          If the Draytons are at the Embassy,
          Hank has to be there too!

Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Grimly)
          You're probably right.   But we can do
          nothing.

                      BEN
          Why can't you?

                      BUCHANAN
          Every Embassy in a foreign country has
          extra-territorial rights.

                      BEN
          What does that mean in common language?

                      BUCHANAN
          As far as we're concerned, this Embassy
          stands on foreign soil.

                      BEN
          Does that mean they can steal children
          and get away with it?

                      BUCHANAN
          We could have the Foreign Office serve
          a writ on the Ambassador.

He breaks off and speaks apologetically as If it were
I parenthesis.

                      BUCHANAN
          ...You know, I'm not responsible for
          the complications of International
          Law...

He resumes:

                      BUCHANAN
          ...If only we had positive proof that
          the boy really is in there.

As they are talking Ben is thinking hard, obviously
hatching some scheme in his mind.

                      BEN
          What's the telephone number of this
          Embassy.

Both of the men looking at Ben a moment without
answering and then Woburn speaks first.

                      WONBURN
          Grosvenor 0144.

                      JO
          What are you thinking about, Ben?

Without answering Jo, Ben picks up the 'phone.

                      BEN
          Grosvenor 0144.

Ben looks at the group briefly.   Buchanan looks at Ben
with keen curiosity.

                      BEN
          I'm going to speak to the Minister
          himself.

Buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. We hear the
answering click on the other end of the phone.

                      BEN
          May I speak to the Prime Minister,
          please?

There is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice
mumbling on the other end of the phone. Ben interrupts
the question.

                      BEN
          Tell him the lady who saved his life
          wants to speak to him. Its important.

The voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly,
and there is silent. Ben has a satisfied look on his
face, as he hands the receiver to Jo. She seems
frightened.

                      JO
          What am I supposed to say, Ben? I
          don't know --
              (She trails off)
          Ben, half looking at Woburn and
          Buchanan, gives her instructions.

                      BFN
          He said he wanted to visit us soon so
          he could thank you.

          have to leave London tomorrow.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

In the Ambassador's study underneath the oil painting
of himself, the Prime Minister is escorted to a
telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument.
Having been told who was on the other and of the line
he is all smiles as he greets Jo.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          My dear lady...This is a charming
          surprise...

He listens to the other end of the phone, agreeably
making sounds such as "ah ha" "ah" "hum", then he
speaks, with a gracious sweep of his hand and a half
bow to the telephone.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          Delighted, delighted, delighted. The
          Ambassador, too, will be delighted.
          Any friends of mine are friends of
          his. We will drink a little toast to
          your country and to mine. Peacefully
          we will co-exist...Yes?

He looks up to admire the painting of himself on the
wall.


INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo hangs up the phone, a little surprised and still
considerably nervous.

                       JO
              (To Ben)
          He said -- all right.

A taxi pulls up in the front of the large, old-fashioned
Embassy. The windows are brightly lighted, evidence
of a social occasion. Ben and Jo get out of the taxi.

Ben pays the driver, takes Jo's arm, and they start up
the steps of the Embassy. The CAMERA PANS them.

EXT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben presses the doorbell. His grip on Jo's's arm slides
down to her hand. He holds it tightly.

The door opens, and a liveried man ushers them in with
gesture.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes
the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of
people listening to the music of a string quartet
playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is
the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo
and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager.
The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid
a round of polite applause. There are people rising
from their chairs and a general movement out into the
hallway.

                     AIDE
          Good even. Would you come this way,
          please? The Prime Minister is waiting
          for you.

Following the Aide, Ben and Jo squeeze through the
crowded doorway.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the
CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room
people begin to notice them, first of all because they
are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks
seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of
applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize
them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who
is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first
row.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Prime Minister recognizes them immediately, and
comes forward quickly to meet them.

                      PRIME MINISTER
              (Effusively)
          Good evening, good evening!

The Ambassador is behind the Prime Minister, and the
Prime Minister turns to him with enthusiasm.

              (Suavely)
          Madame, you saved the life of the one
          man, who is irreplaceable in our
          Country.

                      PRIME MINISTER
              (Suddenly to Jo)
          They tell me you are the famous Jo
          Conway, Madame?

                       JO
          Yes.   I'm Jo Conway.

                       PRIME MINISTER
              (To Ben)
          Do you think perhaps Madame might be
          persuaded to sing?

                      BEN
              (interrupting)
          I'm sure she would be glad to...
          wouldn't you dear?

                      JO
          Well, I don't know.     It's been some
          time...

                      PRIME MINISTER
          I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to
          conclude a dramatic evening!

                       JO
          All right.   I'm very flattered.

                      AMBASSADOR
              (To butler)
          Stanis would you put up some chairs
          quickly.
              (To guests)
          Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us
          tonight...Jo Conway...the famous Jo
          Conway...she has graciously consented
          to sing for us ..
              (To his wife)
          Darling would you see that the Prime
          Minister has a very good seat.

They move off to seats -- Jo is led to piano by
Ambassador. Aide crosses to Ben.

                      AIDE
          Would you like to sit down, sir?

                      BEN

Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over
toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes
are on Jo.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems
serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check
where Ben is.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be
more entertainment, move toward the main room.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A tries out the keys of the Piano.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

People are finding their seats. There is coughing,
shuffling of feet, and then a gradual hush.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng
around the room, particularly toward the various exits.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays
the introduction to her song. We see the great
tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional
smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but
always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice
seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole
room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place
that she has become so professional in such an intimate
drawing room setting.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - FULL SHOT

Everyone in the ballroom is listening intently, and
with surprise, at her singing.

The hallway, showing people crowded at the door,
listening.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The first landing on the flight of stairs above the
hallway. No one is around. Jo's voice loses some of
its volume.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

A higher stairway landing.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A second floor corridor, deserted.    Jo's voice fading.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the
song floating up clearly, but much diminished.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna
is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled.
Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his
feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to
open it.

                      HANK
          That's my Mother's voice!    That's my
          Mother singing!

Mrs. Drayton is quite startled by Hank's performance.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Hank -- are you sure? Are you really
          sure?

Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks
slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton,
listening and thinking about what he hears.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought
coming into it. She looks down at Hank.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Hank? -- can you whistle that song?


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

He looks at her and nods abstractedly.

                        HANK
          I guess so.

She kneels down quickly to him.

                      MRS DRAYTON
          Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it
          as loud as you can.

On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can
barely believe what she means. Then he understands.
He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to
whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously.
Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as
she watches him.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as
she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a
moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears
it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough
for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for
the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom
to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

Jo continues her song with almost excitement in her

Ben makes his way along the wall toward the far doorway,
which leads to the grand staircase Everyone is so intent
on listening to Jo, that his movement attracts no
attention.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

At the bottom of the service stairs in the back of the
Embassy, Drayton is standing with two men who came
with him in the car. One of them holds a short length
of rope in his hand.

                      DRAYTON
          You two wait in the mail room.   I'll
          bring him down.

Ben mounts two stairs leading up to the grand staircase.
He looks about him cautiously.

At the service stairs, Drayton goes up two stairs and
turns back to the men. He looks at his watch.

          I won't be a minute.

He starts to move up one step.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Up in the room, Hank is bent in a chair, sobbing, Mrs.
Drayton is kneeling by him, trying to reassure him.
She stops suddenly as she hears footsteps in the
distance. She rises to her feet, and as the footsteps
grow and grow, she looks at the boy desperately, She
goes to the door, hears the steps coming nearer and
nearer. She looks across at the window.

down again and clutches the boy to her as the  footsteps
stop outside the door. She looks at the door,   with
horror.

The door handle turns quietly, but firmly.

Mrs. Drayton lets out a piercing scream. Hank's head
jerks up. The door is heard bursting open.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward
Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet,
and the two of them come together. No clear words are
spoken, Just muffled sounds of words as they hug each
other. Then they release each other, and turn to look
at Mrs. Drayton. She is standing, staring at the door
with horror. Ben turns quickly to look.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Framed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches
into his pocket and produces a small automatic.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

For a moment the group stands there in silence.    Then
Ben speaks.

                      BEN
          I don't think you want to start any
          shooting, Drayton -- with all those
          people downstairs, and police outside.

Drayton looks at him without saying anything, but the
gun doesn't lower.

Mrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          You've got to let the boy go!

He moves forward on   the group, gun poised. Hank
clutches his father   in fright, and Ben tenses himself,
prepared for battle   if necessary. Mrs. Drayton stares
at her husband with   some defiance. Drayton addresses
Ben amiably.

                      DRAYTON
          I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help
          me out of here?

          Don't ask me for help, you miserable....

Drayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans
down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly.

          You wouldn't want your father to get
          hurt, would you?

Hank looks up towards his father.    Drayton looks up.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down
at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode,
but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning.
Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face.
He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it.

                       DRAYTON
          We'll go down the stairs   together in a
          casual sort of way. Then    we'll stroll
          along to the nearest taxi   rank. I
          trust there won't be any   emotional
          outbursts...

                       BEN
              (Interrupting)
          There won't be. Hank -- don't say or
          do anything.

Hank just nods.   He's too frightened to talk.

                         DRAYTON
          Shall we go?

Ben starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves
into the other side of Hank. As they go through the
door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward,
if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of
Hank in danger stops her.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The trio, Hank in the center, slowly strolls down the
corridor toward the main stairway. The sound of Jo
Conway's voice can be heard from below.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

SHOOTING FROM BELOW we see the big staircase empty for
a moment, then the three appear at the top.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view shows the terrified, tear-stained face
of Hank, and the tense features of Ben. Drayton seems
carefully alert. The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front
of them as they descend. The music coming from the
ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There
is the sound of great applause. The three are about a
dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots
out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by
surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs
clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the
gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled
heap at the bottom of the stairs.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The applause having died out, the shot is heard loud,
and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway.
They rush for the stairway, and Drayton's body, led by
the Ambassador and the Prime Minister.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As people crowd excitedly around the body, Ben is
hurrying Hank away from the scene, the CAMERA PANS
them.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Mrs. Drayton stops half-way down the stairway, and
looks down in shook at the sight of her dead husband.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Inside the ballroom, which is emptying due to the rush
of people to the corridor, Jo has risen from the piano
and is almost afraid to go out and see what has
happened. In a moment, Ben and the boy appear in  the
doorway. Hank rushes across the ballroom to his  mother,
who moves quickly when she sees him.

                         HANK
           Mummy.

                         JO
           Hank.

They embrace.

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Inside the McKenna's hotel room, the Parnells and the
two woman guests are sprawled out in ungainly attitudes
of sleep. Val is snoring pleasantly. The door of the
room opens and the three McKennas appear. The sound
awakes Val. He peers at them sleepily and struggles
to a sitting position. Ben closes the door.

                       BEN
           I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val,
           but we had to go and pick up Hank.

Ben's voice awakens the other women. They sit up, and
stare with bewilderment at the smiling trio of Ben, Jo
and Hank.

FADE OUT

                              THE END
MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD



                        Written by

                 John Collee & Peter Weir




   1. THE OCEAN - DUSK

   From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,
   abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided
   valleys of water.

   Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the
   ocean and an adjacent coastline.

   In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a
   small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering
   darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.

   2. THE SHIP - DUSK

   [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a
   man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her
   great guns projecting from every gun-port.

   As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is
   visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.

   3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

   The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:

           HMS Surprise
           Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.
           Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806
           Mission: Intercept and destroy French
           Privateer, Acheron


   5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

   CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the
   table, studying charts.

   His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of
   indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.

   JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops
   below the great casement windows.

   KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and
   retires.
                    JACK
          (Absently) Thankee Killick

   4. THE CHARTS:

   a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.

   Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,
   bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then
   another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.

   On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and
   detailed information in fine copperplate script:

          6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks
          (exact position unknown). Hidden reef.

   6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

   Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his
   pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running
   from brow to chin.

   He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out.

7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT

Dr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk
surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific
instruments.

[   ]

TOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but
the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced
structure, is too engrossed to notice him.

8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT

In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from
an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.

PETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about
whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth
mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to
resume.

                    BLAKENEY
          In
                      CALAMY
          Out.

                    BLAKENEY
          In. It was here. The line is in.

                    CALAMY
          It was there. It was out. Out

                    BLAKENEY
          In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.

The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much
older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a
sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing
up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.

9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT

By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few
of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.

Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down
greedily

One man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD
DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first
link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.

JOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in
the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling
their foreheads in deference to the officer.

10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT

Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of
'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the
powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns
during action.

11.    BERTH DECK - NIGHT

A hundred hammocks swing like strange pods, close packed
under the immense beams. Most of the occupants are already
asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head

                    HOLLAR
          Lights out!

On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb
into their hammocks.

The last lights are extinguished. Only PULLINGS' lamp
remains, moving up the ladder to...

12.   WEATHER DECK - NIGHT

The uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel
gangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck
(aft).

The lead is dropped from the bows. As PULLINGS walks aft to
the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea
line.

                     CREWMEN
           Watch there! Watch

Somewhere a bell sounds and the silent figures of the watch
call from their stations.

                     WATCH CAPTAINS
           - Lifebuoy all's well!
           - Starboard gangway all's well!
           - Starboard bow all's well!

Over this, the splash of the lead and the repeated cry of
"Watch there! Watch!"

13.     QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant
MOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.

JACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first
time: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair
clubbed at the back

At the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,
BONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK
their current course.

JACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS. Jack
sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice.

                     JACK
           How I do hate a lee shore

                     PULLINGS
           You think we'll have long to wait?
                    JACK
              (shrugs)
          Intelligence reports had her leaving
          Boston on the 12th, that should put us at
          least a week ahead.

                    PULLINGS
          She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.

The pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but JACK
lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense,
expectant silence.

                    JACK
          In for a "Surprise". Now that's wit. "In
          for a Surprise". 'Pon my word I shall
          have to tell the Doctor.

He leaves, still laughing. Those on the quarterdeck are more
amused by JACK's unique sense of humour than by the feeble
joke itself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (calls back)
          Don't put her on the reef, Tom.

                    PULLINGS
          I'll try not to, Sir.

13A    INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN

Jack looks around the door

                    JACK
          What do you have there, Stephen?

He enters. Stephen has wired together the thorax of a bird's
skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it

                    STEPHEN
          The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you
          remark its prodigious strength.

Jack bends forwards into the candle-light, sharing his
friends keen interest in this strange assembly

                    JACK
          I do and I am not in the least surprised,
          for it reminds me of nothing so much as a
          ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.
          Here the mast, and here the backstays
          running aft.

                    STEPHEN
              (adds another weight)
          Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing
          a paper for the Royal Society.

Jack straightens, moving with care between the bottled
specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments

                    JACK
          I was thinking when our business here is
          finished, we will have to put in to
          Recife for provisions. You may care to
          take a tour round the forests of Brazil,
          botanizing and collecting specimens. An
          anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.

                    STEPHEN
          I should like it of all things, Jack.
          Thankyou.


14.     WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Time passes. The fog intensifies. White coils of mist drift
and eddy over the glassy sea, RUN FINAL TITLES as the ship
moves slowly through the night.

15-16   (ADDED TO SC 12)

17.     IN THE GREAT CABIN, LATER - NIGHT

The chronometer ticks. The coffee-pot swings on its gimbals.
JACK lies awake in his hanging cot. Finally he gives up
trying to sleep.

                    JACK
          Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee,
          and light along my topcoat.

18.     ON THE QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK on deck again.

                    QUARTERMASTER
          Six bells and all's well.

A hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift
as an offshore breeze picks up.
                    LEAD-MAN
          90 fathoms, white shelly sand.

                    CALAMY
          Four knots, Sir.

BONDEN is still at the wheel.

                    BONDEN
          Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you
          feels like putting your éad down.

JACK takes his advice and goes below again.

19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE)

The sky a shade paler. A wind coming up.

20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN

The lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist.

                    VINCENT
          Starboard gangway ahoy.

HOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is,
appears at his shoulder.

                    HOLLOM
          What is it, Vincent?

                    VINCENT
          I heard something. A bell.

HOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns.

                    HOLLOM
          Native fisherman perhaps.
          (shouts) Mr. Calamy!

Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          The lead, if you please.

Young CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the
bow of the ship and throws out the lead line.

HOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies
of fog.
Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth.

                     CALAMY (O.S.)
           Sixty fathoms, white sand!

Hollom folds his telescope

                     HOLLOM
           Well. It can't have been a reef marker.

CALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope

                     HOLLOM (CONT'D)
           False alarm Mr CALAMY

CALAMY ignores him, still scanning

21.   TELESCOPE POV

The telescope pans. A dark shape in the distance. The mist
parts a little. A ship. Coming straight toward them.

Close on CALAMY as he turns to camera, screaming -

                     CALAMY
           Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to
           quarters!

22. JACK'S SLEEP CABIN

JACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed.

23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN

A drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their
hammocks and run to their battle stations.

24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK

Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the
operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws,
retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light.

DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he
ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant
surgeon.

25.   POWDER MAGAZINE

Little ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their
boxes of gunpowder to the...

26. GUN-DECK

As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin
partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single
continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin
in the stern.

As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are
thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle-
lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene.

27. WEATHER-DECK

JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the
bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while
others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to
be towed behind the ship.

28. FORECASTLE

JACK and PULLINGS join HOLLOM.

                    JACK
          Where away?

CALAMY points forward and a little to the left of the
Surprise's bow.

                    CALAMY
          Not two miles distant, Sir.

JACK and PULLINGS stare through telescopes into the fog,
which is beginning to lift. JACK lowers his telescope.

                    JACK
          Mr. Hollom?

                    HOLLOM
          I saw nothing, nor heard anything either.
          Shall I ask them men to stand down?

JACK steps closer to the bow, and again lifts his telescope.

29. TELESCOPE P.O.V

A slow pan across the sea, past a darker patch of fog. What
was that? The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a
series of flashes.
30. CLOSE ON JACK

He turns and shouts to the crew -

                     JACK
           Lie down! Everybody lie down!

His words are underscored by a series of distant explosions,
followed by a deep rumble, then a tearing, howling sound.

31. ANGLE ON THE SKY

Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the
air. A blizzard of iron.

32. ON THE DECK

The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is BONDEN hanging
grimly to the wheel.

33. MIDSHIPMAN BLAKENEY

Close, as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers.

34. DELETED

35. DELETED.

36. QUARTERDECK

The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and
metal scythes the length of the deck at head height. This is
rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now
burning on the forecastle.

CALAMY is working at putting the fire out as JACK issues a
stream of orders.

                     JACK
           Run out the guns! Marines to the tops,
           and get that wounded man below!

He pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time.

36A.   GUN DECK

Hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes
DAVIES and his mates.
                     HOLLOM
           ...C-cast loose now... Um swab. That's
           right. Run out your guns.

The men work as a team, largely ignoring Hollom's hesitant
instructions. The shot rack is empty

                     DAVIES
           Shot. There's no shot!

37.   QUARTERDECK (CONTD)

As red-coated marines led by Captain HOWARD climb into the
rigging JACK calls to his clerk -

                     JACK
           Note the time Mr. Watt.

An anxious TOM PULLINGS appears.

                     PULLINGS
           She's out of our range, Sir!

JACK calls to his sailing master, ALLEN.

                     JACK
           Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me
           alongside her at pistol-shot.

ALLEN purses his lips. He knows what he's doing and slightly
resents the instruction

                     JACK (CONT'D)
           Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she
           bears.

38. P.O.V. ENEMY SHIP

She's crossing their bows, about a mile distant.

39. ON DECK

PULLINGS is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle,
past men stacking hammocks as blast protection.

40. ON THE FORECASTLE

Gun-captains stand ready, the slow-match burning in the tubs.

                     PULLINGS
           Fire on the uproll.

The little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on PULLINGS' face.
The ship rolls.

                       PULLINGS (CONT'D)
           Fire!

The drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns.

The smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls
bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship.

                     OLD SPONGE
               (In Greek)
           Witchcraft!

                     DOUDLE
           Never seen the like of it

                     PULLINGS
           Damn and blast you! See to your guns!
           Fire high! Fire for the masts and
           rigging!

As the enemy's murderous long guns run out again.

41.   WIDE ON THE ENEMY SHIP

Her French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on
to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a
series of red flashes.

42.   IN THE COCKPIT

By the dim light of a battle-lantern STEPHEN struggles to
hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools
of blood on the deck.

                     STEPHEN
           More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!

The slightly hung-over HIGGINS reaches for the sand bucket
and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the
Acheron's third broadside hits home.

43.   IN THE GREAT CABIN -

The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing
freely, stows what he can.
44.   IN THE ORLOP

Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water
knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for
the ladder carrying two cannon-balls.

A second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding
his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter.

                       DAVIES
             Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!

45. STAIRS

Follow DAVIES as he runs up to the gun-deck with the shot
under his arms past the powder-monkeys ADDISON and SWIFT,
canisters of gun-powder slung over their shoulders, then he
sees MR. LAMB, the carpenter.

                       DAVIES
             Orlop! We're holed!

As LAMB dives for the ladder.

46.   ON THE GUN-DECK

DAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own
gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or
dead.

The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around
dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against
the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm.

CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck
gaze and takes command.

                       CALAMY
             Davies! Get those bodies overboard!
                 (to HOLLOM)
             Mr. Hollom sir!

HOLLOM sits immobilized by fear. CALAMY grabs the poulterer,
JEMMY DUCKS, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia.

                       CALAMY (CONT'D)
             Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take
             Mr. Hollom below.

                        JEMMY DUCKS
           Aye, sir!

The ship heels as she turns.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles,
turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a
hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes
CALAMY against the bulkhead.

CALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft.
BLAKENEY carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys -

                     BLAKENEY
           More shot! More cartridge!

47.   HULL OF THE SURPRISE

In the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was
destroyed, JACK stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained
figure. He glances back at his men, hunched and ready,
itching to fire.

                     JACK (bellows)
           Steady... Wait for it!

48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE

to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise
heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north.

The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both
come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums.
They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart.

49.   GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

JACK watching the enemy, judging the moment.

                     JACK
           ...wait WAIT! And FIRE!

The great guns go off all together. The cannons leaping back
between their crews. JACK snatches a powder-monkey, ADDISON,
out of the way of the lethal recoil.

50.   QUARTERDECK

Smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a
bowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have
failed to penetrate the enemy timbers.
                     BONDEN
           By all that's holy what is that ship made
           of?

His question coincides with a third full broadside from the
Frenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown
aside, MR. WATT jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast
hit.

A rope sheers and JOE PLAICE is smacked on the skull by a
swinging boom.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, running up on deck, goes to help PLAICE
and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking wound to
his upper right arm.

51. COMPANIONWAY

JACK is half-way up the ladder when he falls, scored across
the forehead by a musket-ball.

Eyesight blurred. Hearing gone. He is dimly aware of small
arms cracking above his head, and someone trying to lift him.

                     JACK
           Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!

                     MOWETT
           You must go below, Sir, you must let me
           help you below!

JACK puts a hand to his bleeding forehead and drags himself
back up the ladder.

52. IN THE TOPS

A furious exchange of fire between CAPTAIN HOWARD's marines
and the sharpshooters in the enemy's rigging.

Howard, a big red-faced man, is in his element, laughing
madly every time he scores a hit.

53. QUARTERDECK

JACK emerges into bloody chaos: screams of the wounded all
around, the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun-smoke.

He wipes blood from his eye as he raises his telescope.

54/55.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.
As the ship passes, her name is visible on the transom -
Acheron.

                     PULLINGS V.O
           Sir....

Jack lowers his telescope. Pullings' expression spells
catastrophe

                     PULLINGS
           It's the rudder.

56.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Grim-faced, JACK hobbles to the shattered taff-rail, sees
BONDEN soaked, having climbed down onto the stern-post.

                     BONDEN
               (shouts up)
           It's shot away below the waterline!


58. COCKPIT

STEPHEN, up to his armpits in blood, operating on a wounded
man, looks up to see three more seriously injured men
arriving.

He pauses, aware of some change.

                     STEPHEN
           Why are we not firing?


57.   GUN-DECK

Spirals of drifting smoke. Blackened bleeding men, their guns
pointing at nothing


                     FASTER DOUDLE
           No steerage.

                     NEHEMIAH SLADE
           We're fish in a barrel



59.   HIGH SHOT
The fog has rolled back, like a great curtain, to reveal the
two frigates.

The badly damaged Surprise, drifting rudderless.

The Acheron, most of her sails intact, beginning the turn
which will put her in position to finish off the Surprise.

60. QUARTERDECK

JACK is joined by ALLEN as the enemy vessel starts crossing
their wake.

                     ALLEN
           He's coming about, Sir.

                     MOWETT
           Should I strike the colours?

All eyes on Jack, poised on the brink of awful defeat.

                     ALLEN
           I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

JACK looks from the wall of fog to the three little boats
they are towing astern.

                     JACK
           Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.

61.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Sudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men
scramble down into the boats. DAVIES settles himself beside
NAGEL in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching
Acheron.

His P.O.V.: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers.

                     PULLINGS
           Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what
           sail you can!

                     JACK
           Stern-chasers to fire when she's in
           range!

62.   STERN OF SURPRISE

Gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards
from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the
boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the
bows as....


64.   MAINMAST/FOREMAST

Men scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered
rigging.

65.   THE GREAT CABIN

Two long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows
of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching
Acheron.

                        MOWETT
           Fire!

65A. MAINMAST

WARLEY, captain of the maintop, directs his men about the
mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill
with what little breeze there is.

                     WARLEY
           Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the
           clew line from the reef points, Cully,
           double up and run her back again!

66. QUARTERDECK

Through PULLINGS' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight
at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise.

                     PULLINGS
           She's gaining on us.

                     JACK
           Start the water, carronades over the
           side.

67.   ANGLE ON THE QUARTERDECK

Crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns
on the quarterdeck.

68.   ANGLE ON THE STERN

Water spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the
quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean.
(NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their
main armament on the gun-deck.)

69. FORECASTLE

JACK races to the bows. Towlines strain as the three small
boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and
cloud. He yells to the straining oarsmen -

                     JACK
           Pull! Pull for your lives.

70.   ANGLE FROM THE BOATS

The men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the
towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the
safety of the fog-bank.

71. WIDE

to see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low
cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear.

72. QUARTERDECK

JACK joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in
the direction of the enemy.

                     JACK
           Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr.
           ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to
           head due east.

ALLEN hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is
momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their
pursuer.

73.   THE LEADING JOLLY BOAT

CALAMY, in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees ALLEN on the
ship, signalling the turn to eastward.

CALAMY signals to BONDEN in the stern of the jolly-boat.

                     BONDEN
               (urgent whisper)
           Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!

One side stops rowing and the boat turns.
74.   THE SURPRISE

A low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us.

Beyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship
rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on
their backs.

75.   QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE

Somewhere astern and to the left JACK can hear shouting on
the Acheron. Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them.

                     PULLINGS
           He's beating inshore.

                     JACK
           Keep rowing

76 MASTS OF THE SURPRISE, (TIMELAPSE) - NIGHT

The tortured sounds of exhausted men rowing as skeins of mist
drift away to reveal a dim, yellow moon. On the horizon the
battered ship in silhouette, lines stretching ahead to her
three small boats.

77 QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Some of the wreckage has been cleared aside, the wounded
moved below. We can hear their moans, and the constant
creaking of the bilge pumps.

JACK and his officers scan the moonlit sea through
telescopes.

JACK's telescope POV: A long slow pan along the dark horizon.

                     ALLEN
           I believe we've lost her, Sir.

JACK collapses his telescope.

                     JACK
           Pass the word to ship oars


78 IN THE JOLLY BOATs. - NIGHT

The rowers slump forwards in their seats, their hands raw and
crabbed.
79 STAIRWELL - NIGHT

JACK moves down a ladder past LAMB coming up from below,
soaking wet and exhausted with his mate Nagel.

                    LAMB
          Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but
          the pumps are keeping it from gaining.

                    JACK
          Very good, Mr. Lamb.

The constant creaking and sloshing of the pumps becomes
louder as he continues down past men handing up food and
powder from the flooded levels below.

81. SICK-BAY

Stephen, his face spattered with blood, is adjusting the wick
of a lantern when Jack arrives beside him

                    JACK
              (sotto)
          What's the butchers bill?

                    STEPHEN
          Six dead, thirteen wounded.

He notices the gash on Jack's forehead

          Your head ...

                    JACK
              (Brushes him away)
          Later.

STEPHEN raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained
men close-packed in the gloom.

Together they make the rounds, passing men propped upright by
their mates, pale with shock or tense with pain, some
struggling to breathe, some barely alive.

JACK clasps hands, whispers encouragement.

A bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp, streaked
with blood and deeply unconscious.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Who's this - Joe Plaice?
                    STEPHEN
              (sotto)
          A severe depressed fracture of the
          skull. I am not sure he will see out the
          night.

Moving on to another barely recognizable face: young
Blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain and
the blood loss.

                    JACK
          Mr. Blakeney?

                    BLAKENEY
          Just a broken arm, Sir.

JACK looks at STEPHEN, whose expression is grim, but he says
nothing, steering Jack forward to the foot of the ladder
where they can speak more privately

                    STEPHEN
          I will do everything possible. I know you
          were close to his father.

Jack nods, defeat weighing heavily, and makes to go. Stephen
puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          One moment Jack let me look at that brow
          of yours.

                    JACK
          Its a scratch.

                    STEPHEN
          I will tell you if its a scratch or not.
          Sit down.

Jack submits meekly, and sits on a lower rung while Stephen
puts a bandage round his forehead

                    JACK
          How did he find us Stephen?
          Seven weeks sailing and he happened in
          darkness on our exact position. Its
          uncanny. He really is a phantom

                    STEPHEN
          Unless she was alerted to our presence,
          and looking for us.
                    JACK
          Tosh. How could that be?

                    STEPHEN
          The French have their spies, in Britain
          as elsewhere.

                     JACK (astonished)
          You're saying there are traitors in the
          Admiralty?

                    STEPHEN
          I am saying do not imagine it was a lone
          privateer who did this to us. He is
          working for Napoleon himself, with access
          to all that tyrant commands, overtly and
          covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too
          heavily upon you.

82.    THE GREAT CABIN - DAWN

Wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody,
bandaged officers, conducting an angry post-mortem as KILLICK
serves coffee.

                    ALLEN
          ...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me
          she's no more a frigate than a painted
          Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a
          two-decker more'n a frigate.

MOWETT is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed.

                    MOWETT
          One does wonder what manner of hull she
          has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off
          her.

Jack enters, his head newly bandaged. He walks past the
seated officers and stands looking out through the stern
windows. The officers continue their conversation, though
their words are intended for Jack

                    PULLINGS
          She had the weather-gauge and long
          eighteens which could hit us beyond our
          effective range. That's the sum of it

                     ALLEN
          And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the
          muzzle flashes.

                    PULLINGS
          It was an unfair match, no dishonor in
          defeat no dishonor at all.

Jack still has his back to them. He puts his hand in his
pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of
his gold pocket watch.

                    ALLEN
              (sighs)
          Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen
          the foresail is too far gone so we'll
          bend our spare.

                      PULLINGS
          Sir.

Jack finally turns.

                    PULLINGS (CONT'D)
          Mr. Allen is confident, with basic
          repairs, we can get home as we are...
          allowing for a stop in Jamaica.

                     ALLEN
          At Port Royal we can haul her into dry-
          dock, and hopefully get her home
          without...

                    JACK
          We're not going home.

An expectant hush. KILLICK is all ears, as he picks up the
coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why
          were we sent? To punish a blackguard
          privateer who has decimated our Atlantic
          whaling fleet and now threatens to do the
          same in the pacific. Are we to leave
          those ships to his mercy and slink back
          into Portsmouth - another defeat to add
          to the list. Is that what we draw our
          wages for? I say we pursue her and pay
          her back with interest

                    ALLEN
          With respect, Captain, she could be half-
          way to Cape Horn by the time we're
           repaired and underway.

                     JACK
               (sternly)
           Then there's not a moment to lose.

83.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

KILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he
passes them to his mate, BLACK BILL -

                     KILLICK (a whisper)
           We're for the Horn.

84.     THROUGHOUT THE SHIP - DAWN

Word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to
the beak of the ship

                      MUTTERED VOICES AD LIB
           -   The Horn you say?
           -   Never! In this condition?
           -   Eh? What news mates
           -   Heading for where?!

85.     FORECASTLE - DAWN

A few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all
of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic
Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing
Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still
shaken by the loss of his gun-crew.

                     higgins
           We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you
           ask my opinion

                     slade
           I'm game. If the captain says we can take
           her we can take her.

                     DAVIES
           Can we catch her is the question.
           And if we do what's different? She'll
           just hold us off with them long eighteens
           til she sends us all to the bottom. All
           for what?

                     DOUDLE
           I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a
           privateer, loaded with all the gems of
           Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the
           prize-money.

                     HOLLAR
           Hoi there! You men jump to it!

86.     WAIST OF THE SHIP - NOON

The gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the
gun-deck.

87.     GUN-DECK - DAY

Part of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is
manhandled by a dozen crewmen.

                     HOLLAR
           Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One
           long pull. Belay!

88.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

Crewmen labour at the capstan.

                     HOLLAR (O.S.)
           Two six heave! Two six heave!

The huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its
gantry. JACK shouts down from the quarterdeck -

                     JACK
           Have her placed along the gunwale for
           now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to
           that side also.

89.   ABOVE JACK'S HEAD

Men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections
of rope.

                     FASTER DOUDLE
           All clear below!

90.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK dodges the falling rope, moving back, past NAGEL and his
men who are cutting out damaged sections of the gunwale with
saws and adzes, prizing up decking and wrestling with the
wrecked steering mechanism.

91.     THE STERN - DAY
JACK looks down to where PULLINGS and others have lifted the
broken rudder from its hinges.

92.    WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship swarming with men, cutting, splicing, hammering and
hauling. Every able-bodied soul hard at work.

93.    QUARTERDECK - DAY

An optimistic breeze has picked up, fluttering the tattered
ensign.

The deck is now sloping at a forty-five degree angle. KILLICK
hands a sandwich to Pullings who passes it down to JACK.

                    JACK
          Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron
          will be making a hundred and fifty miles
          a day in this.

                    PULLINGS
          Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping
          to board the odd merchantman

JACK smiles at this and bites into his sandwich.

To the uphill side, carpenters are erecting a scaffolding
over the side of the ship.

94.    THE SHIP - DAY

The ship's copper-plated keel is partly revealed as the men
clamber and slip about on the steeply-sloping side erecting
scaffolding. The tropical heat resounds with shouts, curses
and hammering.

95.    SIDE OF THE SHIP - DUSK

Carpenters working inside the scaffolding, are fitting new
sections of wood into the holes low in her hull.

                    LAMB
          Down. Down. Stop.

The new piece of wood is an almost perfect fit. MR. LAMB
marks the places where it is jamming.

                      LAMB (CONT'D)
          Up again.
Then he begins to work on it with his rasp.

96.    UNDERWATER - DUSK

Among tropical fish, a diver, a Greek crewman, 'OLD
SPONGE' (father of YOUNG SPONGE) a hammer at his belt, plugs
a few smaller holes with hemp fibre, then surfaces to...

97.    THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER - DUSK

                    OLD SPONGE
              (In Greek)
          The smaller bit. No. That bit there.

YOUNG SPONGE passes him a piece of lead and some nails and
OLD SPONGE dives again.

Our P.O.V. descending into the sea as...

98.    WAIST OF THE SHIP - NIGHT

Roaring flames, flying sparks, the clang of metal on metal. A
forge has been set up. Powder-monkeys sweat on the bellows.
The ship's blacksmith is churning out iron bolts, pintles and
gudgeons, which are snatched away by NAGEL with tongs and
thrown into a bucket of water to cool.

A few yards away, wood chips fly from LAMB's adze as the
ship's massive new stern post takes shape.

The new rudder is laid out flat, already cut to its final
shape and being strengthened with great nails and iron bands
which NEHEMIAH SLADE and AWKWARD DAVIES are nailing into
place.

The hammering travels through the ship to...

99.    THE SICK BERTH - NIGHT

BLAKENEY with his splinted arm jerks awake, feverish and
confused.

                    BLAKENEY
          No. No. Not through my nose!

                    CALAMY
          Its alright. William. You were dreaming.

Blakeney looks around, disoriented and finds Calamy by his
side.
                    BLAKENEY
          Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew
          you up in your hammock with the last
          stitch through your nose... to make sure
          you're not just sleeping

                    CALAMY
          You know old Joe, always telling [ ]
          stories.

                    BLAKENEY
          Is it true though? [    ] About the last
          stitch?

                    CALAMY
          Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine
          first.

                    BLAKENEY (drifting)
          Not through my nose. You'll tell them.

                     CALAMY
              (nods)
          Nor any other part of you.

Trying to make light of it, though he fears BLAKENEY is
dying.

100.       SICK BAY, LATER - NIGHT

CALAMY has fallen asleep by BLAKENEY's side. He wakes to find
STEPHEN sniffing BLAKENEY's wound.

                    CALAMY
          Is it mending, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          No, I'm afraid it will not do.

101.        THE COCKPIT - NIGHT

BLAKENEY is lowered onto the table, delirious. CALAMY holds
his head and PADEEN, MATURIN's giant manservant, his legs,
which are lashed together.

                    BLAKENEY
          No. Mamma. Mamma.

                    STEPHEN
          It is the laudanum speaking. You will be
          a regular Nelson.

He tests the edge of his knife with his thumb.

CALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth.
Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips
BLAKENEY shattered arm.

A sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting
off the arm.

Close on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed.

He puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in
the pail of hot tar.

BLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking
uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has
tears in his eyes also.

STEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile to
BLAKENEY.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          There. I have never seen a braver
          patient.

102.        SICK-BERTH - NIGHT

An exhausted CALAMY keeps vigil by BLAKENEY's cot. The boy
wakes, and looks for CALAMY in the darkness.

                    BLAKENEY
          Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my
          arm off.

Then he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream

                    CALAMY
          You would have died else.

Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Come. You can still sup your grog with
          your left. And I shall take your turn at
          marbles.

103.        MIZZEN TOPGALLANT - DAY

MOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the
lashings round the new mizzen top. Below him the great work
is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part
of the hull.

MOWETT climbs down past FASTER DOUDLE who has one leg looped
through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands
and his teeth.

Farther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its
gaskets.

Beyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group
of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning JOE
PLAICE.

104.        BASE OF THE MAINMAST - DAY

STEPHEN's drill carves out a neat disc of bone to reveal a
purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity.

A small crowd of crewmen pause in their work, watching the
doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff
in a dish.


                    SLADE (shouts)
          Is them his brains, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          No, that is just blood. These are his
          brains.

Exposing them to view. Several of the crew move in for a
closer look. The armourer hands STEPHEN a flattened coin,
which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old
hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen
Stephen at work.

                    SLADE
          Physician he is, not one of your common
          surgeons.

                    FASTER DOUDLE
          Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and
          the strong fives, wouldn't look at you
          for under ten guineas on land.

                    DAVIES
          [   ] Knows his birds and beasts too
          boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell
          you what it's thinking.
105.           THE SURPRISE - DAY

A wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring
impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as...

106.           QUARTERDECK - DAY

...JACK jumps down from the mizzen ratlines.

                    JACK
          Let us be off, Mr. Allen!

                    ALLEN
          Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr
          Hollom!

107. ON DECK

Barefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing
above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the
ratlines, along the yards.

A small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are
contrasting slow off the mark

                    HOLLOM
          Bear a hand there you fellows!

The men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which
unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a
rope

108.       QUARTERDECK - DAY

                    MOWETT
          Up and down Sir, thick and dry for
          weighing.

109.           WAIST OF THE SHIP - DAY

Men strain on the capstan bars.

110.           BOWS - DAY

The anchor bursting up out of the sea.

111.           MASTS OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

The shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the
sun.
                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          Trice up. Lay out.
          Sheet home!
          Hoist away!

112.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

HOLLAR staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind.

                    HOLLAR
          Cheerly there in the foretop, our
          William!
          T'garnsl sheets!
          Hands to the braces!

Men slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then
swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling
ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies.

113.        WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship spreading its wings. A sudden cracking of canvas as
she turns and runs directly downwind.

114.        QUARTERDECK - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun has sunk lower. BONDEN, solid as the rock of
Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly
behind.

                    JACK
          Speed, Mr. Boyle

BOYLE heaves the log clear of the ship's side. The log line
races out on its reel. BOYLE checks the run, pulls the pin.

                    BOYLE
          Ten and a half knots, Sir.

JACK makes no comment but the news seems to please him.

115.        CLOSE TO THE WATER - DUSK

The great hull powers past us.

116.   DELETED

117.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area.
From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello
tuning up. KILLICK glances irritably at the door and elbows
his mate, BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK
          Here we go again: scrape, scrape,
          screech, screech and never a tune you
          could dance to, not if you were drunk as
          Davey's sow.

118.    INSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

JACK and STEPHEN are both keen amateur musicians - JACK,
violin, STEPHEN cello.

As Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a
refrain.

                    STEPHEN
          Is that one I know, or are we breaking
          new ground?

                    JACK
          I am trying to remember that air they
          played all those years ago at the
          Governors house in Port Mahon. You
          remember When we first met.
          Corelli if I'm not mistaken.

He plays another riff

                     STEPHEN
          If that is your "A" you are very much so.
          This is A.

Jack corrects his A string, plays another few bars

                    JACK
          Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom

                    STEPHEN
          All I remember is you being unable to sit
          in your seat the entire performance.

                    JACK
          Aye and you practising apon that poor
          bishop with your "puddings athwart the
          starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant
          nonsense.

                    STEPHEN
              (laughs)
          No. That was off Toulon, during the
          blockade. At our first meeting they
          played this:

He plays a short refrain

                    JACK
          No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom-
          POM I have now

He plays another variation

                    STEPHEN
              (enjoying the game)
          Or was it something like this....

Cello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth,
improvising freely now with an infinity of variations,
sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly
hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over

119.        A HIGH POINT OF VIEW, TIME LAPSE - DAY

The tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean. From its side,
cotton-wool puffs of smoke.

120.        GUN-DECK - SAME TIME

A rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns.

                    JACK
          And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging
          we want!

MOWETT timing the gap between each broadside.

                    MOWETT
          Three minutes ten, Sir.

                    JACK
          Not good enough! We must fire three
          broadsides to her two. Again!

Turning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still looks
pale and a little unsure of himself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a
          gun?
                    BLAKENEY
          As you will. Sir.

                    JACK
          'Spitfire', hop to it.

BLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is in
charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now
directing 'Sudden Death'.

Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing
with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions',
'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out your
gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!'

121.        AND AGAIN - DUSK

As another broadside shakes the deck, STEPHEN hauls his
collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of
sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like
opals in the pink light.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)
          Two minutes five, Sir.

                    PULLINGS
          Again!

122.        AND AGAIN - NIGHT

It's a race. JACK's orders are just a formality, the sequence
having become so automatic now.

                    JACK
          Out Tompions... Run out your guns...
          Prime.

Seconds ticking away on MOWETT's stopwatch, barrels float on
the sea a hundred yards out.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          As she bears, from forward aft. Point
          your guns... Fire!!

123.   THE OCEAN AT NIGHT

The black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around
the target barrels erupting in great spouts.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)
          Two minutes dead.

124.   THE GUNPOWDER ROOM

Boom! Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds
through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down
through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with
more cartridge.

For them too it's a race, little ADDISON just ahead of SWIFT,
RYE hot on his heels.

125.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard
from STEPHEN's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax.

He is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from
his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the
array of aquatic life-forms. He removes his ear-plugs, but
the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces
them.

126.        ON THE GUN-DECK - NIGHT

MOWETT watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up
as he notes -

The concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving
in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time.

And he stops the watch as the first gun fires.

                    MOWETT
          One minute forty-nine, Sir!

His voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close
succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing
with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his
mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected.

127.        IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The table is dragged back into place and settings laid for
dinner.

JACK enters, his face flushed with victory.

                    JACK
          Killick? Killick there.
KILLICK appears.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What do you have for us tonight?

                    KILLICK
          Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face.

                    JACK
          Aah! My favorite.

128.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards
through the warm night.

Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now
they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone
produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum.

A guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with BLACK
BILL who sings a ballad in an African dialect.

There's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age
and nationality - bonds forged by battle and hardship.

OLD SPONGE gets up and dances a Greek dance: obviously a
favorite among the crew. Cheering and cat-calls. Lanterns
coming up from below. More dancing, insults in many
languages, and a song.

                    GUN-CREWS
          Boneparte Boneparte
          That red-faced son of an old French fart
          Hey ho, stamp and go
          Stamp and go, stamp and go
          Hey ho, stamp and go

129.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The singing mixes with the end of a lively dinner given by
JACK for his officers, including a special guest, young
BLAKENEY.

                    PULLINGS
          With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has
          composed a short poem in honour of our
          mission.

                    JACK
          Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.

Reactions around the table, glasses re-filled in
anticipation. MOWETT stands and declaims with a number of
precise airy gestures, like a conductor.

                    MOWETT
          Our brotherhood, some old, some new.
          In blood baptized, in strength renewed.
          In purpose unified and true.
          All thoughts of home forsaken.
          Where duty leads us, there we go.
          Nor rest nor comfort shall we know.
          Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded
          sunk or taken

                    ALL
              (raising their glasses)
          Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear
          him! 'Sunk or taken'...

                    JACK
          Aye and when we do take her we shall give
          her to Tom Pullings as his first command.
          If he don't die before then. Bumpers up
          Tom

                    ALLEN
              (A toast)
          'To wives and sweethearts'.

They raise their glasses -

                    ALL
          'To wives and sweethearts'.

                    PULLINGS
          And may they never meet.

Amid the laughter someone bumps Blakeney's stump. He winces,
then puts a brave face on it

                    BLAKENEY (to JACK)
          I believe you knew Nelson, Sir?

                     JACK
          Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of
          serving under him at the Nile.
               (aside)
          Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you,
          sir.
               (as the bottle moves on)
          In fact I dined with him twice, and he
          spoke to me on both occasions.

The table goes quiet. BLAKENEY is wide-eyed, though partly
from his strenuous efforts to appear sober.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          The first time he said to me - 'May I
          trouble you for the salt, sir?' I have
          always tried to say it as close as I
          could [   ] The second time someone had
          offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night
          and he said no, he was quite warm - his
          zeal for his king and country kept him
          warm.

Amid the general agreement - 'Hear him, hear him', etc.
STEPHEN is noticeably silent.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          It sounds absurd, I know, and were it
          another man you would cry out, "Oh, what
          pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere
          enthusiasm, but with him you felt your
          heart glow.

                    MOWETT
              (raising his glass)
          To Lord Nelson.

                    ALL
          Lord Nelson!

[ ] Stephen joins on the toast, but JACK knows that his
friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him
back in with a joke.

                    JACK
          You see those two weevils, Doctor?

He points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ship's
biscuit.

                    STEPHEN
          I do.

                    JACK
          Which would you choose?

The table tenses with anticipation of one of the Captain's
'jokes'. STEPHEN concentrates.
                    STEPHEN
          There is not a scrap of difference. They
          are the same species of curculio.

                    JACK
          But suppose you had to choose?

                    STEPHEN
          Then I would choose the right-hand
          weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in
          both length and breadth.

                    JACK
          There I have you. You are completely
          dished. Don't you know in the Navy you
          must always choose 'the lesser of two
          weevils'?

He thunders with laughter, the rest joining in, breathless
with mirth, tears of laughter streaming down their faces

                    ALLEN
          'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick
          a pocket. Dýe not smoke it doctor?

                    STEPHEN
              (poker faced)
          Sure there would be some poor thin barren
          minds that would catch at such a paltry
          clench.

Then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter

130.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The crew continue with their own celebration.

The excitement penetrates JOE PLAICE's stupor. Never having
woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and
speaks.

                    PLAICE
          "...And the righteous shall inherit the
          earth."

The men around him stare in amazement.

                    BONDEN
          You hear that. He said something. Joe
          spoke! Say something else Joe
                     JOE
           Handy with that gasket

                     BONDEN
               (shouts up to the quarterdeck)
           He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke

131. QUARTERDECK

The officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and
Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment.

132.   IN THE RIGGING - NIGHT

Midshipmen CALAMY RYE and BOYLE are eating from a bag of
broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the
rigging.

On seeing JACK, they break into their own song.

                     MIDSHIPMEN
           Our captain was very good to us.
           He dipped his prick in phosphorus.
           It shed a light all through the night.
           And steered us through the Bosphorus.

133. QUARTERDECK

JACK pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile.
Beside him in a chair sits BLAKENEY, his empty jacket sleeve
pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at
the older boys cheek.

From somewhere on the forecastle, WARLEY and his top-men
start singing.

                     TOP-MEN
           Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish
           ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies
           of Spain...

The older midshipman, HOLLOM joins in, his fine voice soaring
effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering
ballad and converting it to something much more poignant.

                     HOLLOM
           For we've received orders to sail for Old
           England.
           Perhaps we shall never more see you again
His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN
          What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom
          does possess.

134.        IN THE WAIST - NIGHT

KILLICK and NAGEL are less than impressed with HOLLOM and
sing over him, led by ORRAGE the cook.

                    ORRAGE
          Come all you thoughtless young men,
          A warning take by me,
          And never leave your happy homes
          to sail the raging sea.

135.        OCEAN - NIGHT

The Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across
the darkness.

135a.   OCEAN. DAY

The colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics
to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes.

Still the surprise sails on

136.        THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

Fingers trace a course down the east coast of South America.
Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first.

                    ALLEN
          This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled
          with Captain Cook and carried a pair of
          Arnott's chronometers.

JACK finds their position and marks it with pencil. A knock
on the door. Officers and crew are now dressed according to
the change in climate

                    KILLICK
          Couple of the men to see you, Sir.

                    JACK
              (without looking up)
          Show them in.
The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What's this?

A scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every
detail. Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold
on the stern - Acheron.

                    NAGEL
          It were Warley's idea, Sir.

                    WARLEY
          I thought she were familiar like, then I
          remembered where I'd seen her - in
          Boston, during the Peace.

                     JACK
          [   ] In Boston?

                    WARLEY (nods)
          Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them
          working on her, something right strange
          about her scantlings. Then I seen them
          balls bounce off her an' I got to
          thinking.

                    NAGEL
          If you look here, Sir. One side opens up.

He pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction.

                    WARLEY
          Mister Nagel here done it just like I
          seen her - a third layer 'tween the
          outer and inner ribbing - diagonal
          bracing, see?

                    JACK
          Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12
          pounders couldn't penetrate except at
          close range.

He passes the model to ALLEN.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Killick. Killick, there.

KILLICK enters.
                    JACK (CONT'D)
          An extra ration of rum for these men,
          from my private store.

                    KILLICK
              (shaking his head)
          Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.

                    JACK
          Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for
          Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst
          we're alive!

KILLICK goes to get the bottles

JACK hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as
though studying its tiny occupants.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          He's vulnerable here.

He taps the stern windows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Cross her stern, rake her with a
          broadside through her length. But how to
          get close enough? Past those long
          eighteens. That's the devil of it.

136b    SURPRISE QUARTERDECK DAY

The Surprise has stopped level with a Spanish merchantman,
which lies three hundred yards away, headed in the opposite
direction.

The two boats have hove to and are communicating by
megaphone, Stephen translating the Spanish captains words,

                    STEPHEN
          He says they were chased for three days
          till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun
          French privateer headed due south.

                    JACK
          Capital. Thank him and let us be off.

The Spanish captain, already making sail, waves and shouts a
greeting, which Stephen calls back to him.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What did he say there?

                    STEPHEN
          A Spanish farewell. "May no new thing
          arrive." New things being generally by
          their nature bad.

137.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Stephen is with Blakeney, re-bandaging the younger man's
stump. Blakeney looks away, his eyes moving over the doctors
collection of books, learned texts in French Spanish, Greek
and Latin

                    BLAKENEY
          Do you have a manual of exercises sir.

                       STEPHEN
          Exercises?

                    BLAKENEY
          Physical exercises, to make the left arm
          as powerful as the right once was.

                    STEPHEN
          I think that will happen with usage, at
          least to a certain extent.

                    BLAKENEY
          But not completely. I will never be whole
          again, will I?

                    STEPHEN
          No but you will adapt to your new
          situation

          The natural world shows us any number of
          examples of how that is possible.

Blakeney bites his lip

                    BLAKENEY
          You know my father was a great fighting
          captain. It was always his expectation I
          would follow in his footsteps. I worry
          that with this arm I will now be good for
          nothing but book learning and philosophy.

                    STEPHEN
          Ah. Like me you mean.
                     BLAKENEY
               (becoming tearful)
           I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot
           or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress
           myself. What chance to I have now of even
           making first lieutenant.

                      STEPHEN
           You have every chance. You hear me every
           chance. Only the other day I heard the
           captain singing your praises. Your
           courage, your fortitude in battle, your
           skill at logarithms and double elevations
           whatever they may be. And when you are
           rated lieutenant you shall have someone
           to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and
           help you with your jacket. Here take my
           handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed
           to dinner.

139.         MAIN MAST - DAWN

The maintop captain, WARLEY, shouts to the deck, his breath
forming in the frosty air -

                     WARLEY
           Sail on the larboard bow!

140.   GREAT CABIN/LADDER

JACK throwing on a heavy boat-cloak, running for the ladder,
KILLICK behind him trying to get a scarf about JACK's neck
and a cap on his head.

141.         THE RIGGING - DAWN

Follow JACK as he runs up the ratlines, over the futtock
shrouds, then up the topmast shrouds, finally arriving at the
very top of the mast, to join WARLEY and PULLINGS.

                     JACK
           Where away?

                     PULLINGS
           Hull down, two points off the larboard
           beam.

JACK takes the telescope.

142.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.
Just the tips of masts, the hull below the horizon.

                    WARLEY (O.S.)
          She's a frigate all right, but no way of
          knowing if she be the phantom.

Beyond the distant ship, a line of black clouds.

143.        RIGGING - DAWN

JACK and PULLINGS slide to the deck on parallel back-stays,
as careless as a couple of midshipmen.

144.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK shouting -

                    JACK
          Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then
          wet the sails and have the idlers placed
          along the rail.

PULLINGS and HOLLAR bark out their orders. Men race to obey.

JACK steps up on the gunwale, spying out the distant ship.
BLAKENEY, nearby, rests his telescope on CALAMY's shoulder,
focussing with his left hand.

                    BLAKENEY
          Is it him, Sir?

                    JACK
          Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy
          she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin
          to join us, he loves a good chase.

BLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail
which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables.

Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale,
like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the
pull of the sails.


145.        WEATHER-DECK - DAY

Their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the
forecastle. A man falls and rolls into the scuppers.

                    MOWETT
          Lifelines fore and aft!

                    JACK
          Speed, Mr. Calamy?

CALAMY heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts
back to JACK -

                    CALAMY
          Twelve knots, Sir!

146.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Heeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing
as she clefts the waves.

147.        FORECASTLE - DAY

Lined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at
their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye
aloft on the creaking topmost spar.

                    JEMMY DUCKS
          We're cracking on, eh?

                    FASTER DOUDLE
          We'll be cracking off presently if he
          doesn't watch it.

                    SLADE
          No, he knows this ship. He knows what she
          can take.

He touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who
gives a meaningful roll of his eyes.

Ahead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey.

148.        GREAT CABIN - DAY

PULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR. LAMB,
with whom he has been arguing a point.

                    PULLINGS
          We can just see her topsails. She's made
          her turn westwards.

                    LAMB
          I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not
          round Cape Horn.
                     JACK
          I'll not lose her now. Set a course
          westwards.

Both men accept this and leave.

149.        QUARTERDECK (TIMELAPSE) - DAY

The wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like
the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips.

PULLINGS and LAMB are looking up at the mizzenmast which is
making ominous creaks and groans.

                    JACK
          Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps
          and light hawsers to the mastheads.

JACK stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a
switchback landscape of massive rolling waves.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Better get below, Mr. Pullings!

                       PULLINGS
          What, Sir?

                    JACK (GRINNING)
          Better get some food in you. Before it
          turns nasty.

150.        OCEAN - DAY

Wide to see the two ships. The Surprise and the Acheron with
a mile of sea between them. It's like some great ocean race,
with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling
conditions.

151.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a
landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying
motion.

The forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising
each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from
her scuppers.

KILLICK comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. JACK
drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. A wild
unruly part of him is loving this.

Above him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the
mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky.

152.   BELOW DECKS

The dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates
sliding over the table. Crewmen walk up hill to the grog
barrel, down their ration and head up top again.

                     HIGGINS
           You reckon Captain will keep chasing him
           'round the Horn with every stitch of
           canvas flying?

                     DAVIES
           I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of
           hell if he has to.

                     PLAICE
           And that's where we're all going if he
           doesn't take in sail.

Since his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random
pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle.

153.   ON DECK

The wind rising from yell to shriek. Waves blown flat by it,
the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a
raging expanse of white foam.

Four men on the wheel, lashed to it, with the air around them
full of water.

In the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea,
distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a
preposterous height.

JACK looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the
quarterdeck, the officers glancing from the sails back to
JACK.

                     JACK
           Strike the topgallants.

Men gratefully rush to the ratlines and begin climbing to the
masts.

STEPHEN staggers up onto deck. JACK calls to him, pointing at
the black rock.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Cape Horn, Doctor!

STEPHEN stares across at the legendary Cape. He's struggling
with his pocket-glass when a lurch of the ship sends him
tumbling. As men help him below, WARLEY, the maintop captain
reports to the bosun.

                    HOLLAR (to WARLEY)
          Help them with that mizzen topgallant!
          You go too, Mr. Hollom!

HOLLOM looks desperate as he follows WARLEY up the ratlines
of the mizzen.

154.   MIZZEN TOPgallant MAST

WARLEY works frantically. He's out on the yardarm high above
the raging sea. He shouts for HOLLOM to join him, but HOLLOM
is still in the top, some twenty feet below, unable or
unwilling to climb any higher.

155.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide to see the ship. WARLEY working on the swaying mizzen.
The bow swinging a couple of points further south.

156.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

Wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn. Then a
tremendous crack as the mizzen-topmast splits and flies
backward into the sea, carrying WARLEY along with it.

                    BONDEN
          Man overboard!

Sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel. A loose
block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale.

JACK fights free from the tangle of ropes as WARLEY vanishes
in the foam. The mizzenmast is acting as a sea-anchor
dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks.

JACK grabs a speaking-trumpet as WARLEY briefly reappears.

                    JACK
          Swim for the wreckage, man!

Then to PULLINGS.
                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Reduce sail!

As crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging, JACK turns
back to see WARLEY desperately swimming toward the trailing
wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling
wind.

With sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the
dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the
waves.

                    BONDEN
          She's broaching!

PULLINGS runs to JACK, pointing to the trailing mass of ropes
and mast.

                    PULLINGS
          It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut
          it loose, Sir!

WARLEY still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under
with each wave. JACK, agonized, makes his decision.

                    JACK
          Axes!

AWKWARD DAVIES scrambles up the ladder with an axe, but loses
his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck.

JACK grabs the axe and attacks the ropes. He's joined by
NAGEL who has run to assist before realizing that the man
overboard is his friend Warley.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Set to then. Set to!!

NAGEL's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys Jacks orders
and starts chopping. He and Jack work shoulder to shoulder,
matching blow for blow [   ]

The prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right
angles to the ship.

157.        ON THE GUN-DECK - DAY

A hatch cover is torn off by the force of water, a sudden
mighty deluge pouring down into the lower levels drenching
the men and swamping the guns.
                    HOLLAR (yells below)
          All hands to the pumps!

158.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK and NAGEL [   ] keep hacking at the tangle of ropes.
Knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free
the dragging mast.

Finally they succeed. The last of the ropes [ ] whips away,
the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings
southward, away from the rocks.

The wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving WARLEY
struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone.

Then another wave breaks over him and he is gone.

NAGEL is bereft. JACK lowers his head.

159.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK
          He's been at it again.

                    BLACK BILL
          Who's that then?

                       KILLICK
          The Jonah.

                    BLACK BILL
          What Jonah?

160.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits at his desk. The model of the Acheron that WARLEY
helped make sits accusingly in front of him.

STEPHEN pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself.

                     STEPHEN
          The deaths in actual battle are the
          easiest.
              (beat)
          For my own part - those who die under the
          knife or from some consequent infection:
          I have to remind myself that it is the
          enemy who killed them, and not me.
              (beat)
          Warley was a casualty of war, as surely
          as if a French ball had taken him.

JACK nods. Obviously the death still weighs on his
conscience. [ ]

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
              (offering the wine)
          At the same time....

He breaks off

                    Jack
          At the same time, what?

Stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully

                    STEPHEN
          You know that I wear two hats on every
          voyage. I am the captains particular
          friend and supporter, but also I am the
          ships doctor in which later capacity I am
          party to....

He catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

                    You don't want me to continue.

                    JACK
              (stiffly)
          On the contrary. I insist on it.

                    STEPHEN
          There is talk below decks of turning
          back. Or rather that we should have
          turned back some weeks ago. Of course the
          men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere,
          and usually in the confident expectation
          of victory. But that of course is the
          problem.

                    JACK
          What is the problem?

                    STEPHEN
          That you are not accustomed to defeat
          Jack. That you have taken it too
          personally. That chasing this larger,
          faster ship, with its long guns, is
          beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth
          before destruction'?

                    JACK
          It's not pride nor anything like it, it's
          a question of duty.

                    STEPHEN
          'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end
          of discussion.

                    JACK
          You can be as 'satiric' as you like,
          Stephen, but I have my orders. She is
          attacking our whalers. For why? Without
          whales we have no boot polish, nor any
          soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil
          our sabres and muskets. Destroying our
          whalers could win the war for Napoleon.
          Which is why we must catch this Acheron.
          As a man of learning surely you can see
          that.

                    STEPHEN
          At whatever the cost?

                     JACK
          Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I
          will calculate that myself, Stephen
          without reference to your friends in the
          ward room.

160A MIZZEN-TOP

An icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen
mast.

Hollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions
between the men in the rigging and the men on deck

                      HOLLOM
          Cast off.

The new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously
against the mast. Almost claiming Nagel

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          Belay. Sorry. Sorry.
161    QUARTERDECK

PULLING craning upwards. The topmen's shouted commands are
whipped away by the gale.

JACK joins him, still smarting from the conversation with
Stephen

                    JACK
          We'll have to go further south, get
          around this bloody west wind.

                    PULLINGS
          How far south?

                    JACK
          As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The
          sixtieth parallel if need be.

162.        THE SHIP - DAY

Tacking southwards. The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually
disappearing behind layers of cloud.

The wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a
sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but
never ceases.

                                                DISSOLVE TO -

163.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue.
White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy
pink. Others bright ultramarine.

And still the wind howls, driving them further south.

MOWETT passes his telescope to STEPHEN MATURIN. As STEPHEN
studies some seals on an ice-beach, MOWETT launches into
verse, shouting against the wind -

                     MOWETT
          Then we upon the globes last verge shall
          go to view the ocean leaning on the sky
          from thence our rolling neighbours we
          shall know
          and on the hidden world securely pry!

He is interrupted by a bundle of guns clattering on board
from one of the small boats. They are followed by Mr Howard
clad in several thicknesses of sealskin and carrying a brace
of dead penguin.

164.   THE SHIP AT NIGHT

The ship scudding onwards, soundless at this distance, but
for the chilling high pitched whistle of the wind.

An iceberg passes in foreground, fantastic shapes of ice,
like a Gothic cathedral, sculpted by the elements.

165.         BERTH DECK - NIGHT

Hanging stoves provide some feeble warmth. Men huddle close
to them, their breath condensing, or lie shivering in their
bunks, unable to sleep for the cold.

HOLLAR appears with a lantern.

                     HOLLAR
           Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble
           up, tumble up - sleepers awake!

As the previous watch arrive downstairs, numb and dazed from
the cold, the next watch emerge from their hammocks and
dress. No-one speaks.

166.         THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

The officers take their places at dinner. Once again it's
penguin stew.

PULLINGS comes in, with an unexpected smile on his face and
whispers something to JACK.

                     JACK
           Praise be. At last.

The others seem to know what's going on, all except STEPHEN
who looks baffled.

                     STEPHEN
           Pray what is there to celebrate?

JACK holds up his hand for silence. A series of creaks and
groans from the ship. The coffee pot tilts on its gimbals.

                     JACK
           We have made our turn northward, Doctor.
           We are headed back toward the sun...
The officers give a slightly ragged cheer.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          ...in anticipation of which. I asked
          Killick to prepare something special.
              (shouts off)
          Killick. Killick there.

KILLICK comes in with his usual exasperated expression,
bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it.

                    KILLICK
          Which I was just coming.

He lays it on the table.

                    JACK
          Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.

He whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass, a
pudding cut in the oddest of shapes. Everyone stands to get a
better look.

                    STEPHEN
          The Galapagos Islands.

                    PULLINGS
          'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's
          Narborough, Chatham and Hood...

                     JACK
          That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr
          Allen. So that's where the Acheron will
          be headed.

The mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition, as the
officers marvel over the pudding.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Pullings, if you'll permit me, a
          slice of Albermale. For you Doctor,
          Redondo Rock.

There's a tiny man-of-war made of icing, between the islands.
JACK picks it up in his spoon.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          And, with a fair wind behind us the
          Acheron for me.
167.        OPEN OCEAN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

Slow pan over a glassy expanse of water. JACK's head suddenly
breaks the surface, close to camera.

As he swims he brings the Surprise into view. The ship is
utterly becalmed, wallowing in the swell, her sails hanging
limp. A 'painted ship upon a painted ocean'.

JACK swims around the ship, which currently presents a less
than warlike picture with washing hanging from every part of
the rigging.

He calls up to PULLINGS -

                    JACK
          Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on
          these forechains... black strake needs
          another coat.

168.   QUARTERDECK

JACK comes aboard, takes a towel from KILLICK and looks about
him.

The men are holystoning the deck and polishing the
brightwork. They look thin and exhausted and burnt dark-brown
by the sun and wind.

169.   FORECASTLE

Killick is with NAGEL and others tarring the ratlines as he
looks back at HOLLOM, patrolling the gangway.

KILLICK indicates him with a tilt of the head.

                    KILLICK
          That engagement off Recife: his whole gun
          crew killed and him not a mark on him.
          Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley
          falls. And whose watch was it when we
          lost our wind?

HOLLOM sees them looking at him.

170.        THE SCUTTLEBUTT, SHIP'S WAIST - DAY

A marine sentry, TROLLOPE, stands guard by the ship's water-
barrel - the level is very low. STEPHEN ladles some water
into a phial.
                     TROLLOPE
           One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders.

STEPHEN straightening, irritated by the challenge.

                     STEPHEN
           A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for
           scientific purposes only.

171.         STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAY

In the gloom of his cabin, STEPHEN angles the mirror of his
brass microscope toward the window, and places a slide
containing a droplet of water under the lens.

172.         MAINMAST-TOP - DAY

JACK climbs into the top. He adjusts his telescope, studies
the horizon.

173.   JACK'S TELESCOPE P.O.V.

He pans across the empty sea.

174.   STEPHEN'S MICROSCOPE P.O.V.

An assortment of mobile, transparent micro-organisms rotating
wildly.

                     STEPHEN (O.S.)
           My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo.

PADEEN takes a look, amazed then greatly amused.

175.         THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

Charts are spread all over the table, STEPHEN poring over
them when Jack comes in

                     [   ]

                     STEPHEN
           Show me where these Doldrums lie?

JACK joins him.

                     JACK
           Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of
           you? The doldrums is a condition, not a
           region. But you tend to strike 'em
          here...
              (pointing)
          ...between the trades, and the
          sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is
          having it as bad as we are.

STEPHEN considers their current position on the chart, the
tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to
the west of them.

                    STEPHEN
          Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos,
          and not some other point in all this
          vastness?

                    JACK
          Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted
          to go there. It is said to be a natural
          paradise

                    STEPHEN
          In truth I'd be delighted with the merest
          guano stained rock provided it didn't
          sway beneath my feet

                    JACK
          Well, we'll take on food and water once
          we're there, and as compensation for not
          having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that
          during that time, several days at least,
          you can wander at will, catching bugs and
          beetles to your heart's delight. You will
          be the first naturalist to set foot on
          the islands. That is my solemn promise

                    STEPHEN
          I accept, provided the men have not
          mutinied and thrown us all overboard
          before we get there.

                    JACK
          Mutiny? No. They are already counting
          their share of the prize money.

                    STEPHEN
          Another week of this and they shall
          gladly give it up for a glass of clean
          water.

                    JACK
          Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your
          bellyacheing. We shall have rain
          presently, and if not we shall damned
          well tow ourselves out of this.

176.        JOLLY BOAT - DAY

Disgruntled, under-slept men, in boats towing the ship.

NAGEL and DAVIES look back darkly at HOLLOM who sits in the
stern.

                    HOLLOM
          Stroke. Stroke...

                    DAVIES (whispers)
          I heard he were on the Fair Marion as
          foundered off Tresco. And he were on the
          Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar.

HOLLOM has heard this, as DAVIES intended, but he looks away
choosing to ignore them.

177.        FIGHTING TOP - DAY

A view from above of men towing the ship. Over this an
unpleasant scraping sound - chalk on slate.

                    BONDEN
          M-a-s-t... mast

STEPHEN is writing words on a slate then offering them to
BONDEN whom he is teaching to read.

                    BONDEN (CONT'D)
          S-u-n... sun

STEPHEN nods and scratches another word on the board. As
BONDEN struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket
shot and a seabird falls out of the sky.

HOWARD, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket
laughing aloud.

                    STEPHEN
          Is that man completely mad?
              (shouts down)
          Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!

HOWARD looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon
of a face.

                    HOWARD
          Were you never a man for sporting,
          Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in
          these waters with two men loading!

178.        GUN-DECK - DAY

The midshipmen and powder-monkeys have assembled for weapons
practise, armed with cutlasses. CALAMY and WILLIAMSON divide
the group into two teams, choosing sides as for school-yard
football.

                    CALAMY
          Blakeney...

                      WILLIAMSON
          Rye...

                      CALAMY
          Swift...

                      WILLIAMSON
          Boyle...

                    CALAMY
              (the final choice)
          All right, come on Addison.

Little ADDISON joins CALAMY's side, trailing his too-large
sword. WILLIAMSON tosses a coin.

                      CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Heads.

                    WILLIAMSON
          It's tails. We attack.

CALAMY's side retire to a defensive position made of tar
barrels at one end of the deck. From here they are suddenly
aware of Jack idly watching their mock-fight from the
quarter-deck

WILLIAMSON's team give a yell and charge at them.

It's serious fighting. Heads are struck, fingers are rapped.
BLAKENEY, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by
his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers.

                      BLAKENEY
          Ow ow ow!

                      WILLIAMSON
          Yield.

                    CALAMY
          Let go of him.

                    WILLIAMSON
          Yield!!

CALAMY can't drag the bigger boy off. He whips a pistol out
of his belt and fires it at WILLIAMSON's head.

WILLIAMSON is blasted sideways, clutching his face and
yelling in pain. The other boys separate, horrified.

                    CALAMY
          It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in
          it, just powder.

He helps BLAKENEY to his feet.

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Are you all right?

                    BLAKENEY
          No.

Angrily shaking free of him, he looks to where Jack stood,
but the captain is no longer watching.

                    CALAMY
          What's wrong? I saved you.

                    BLAKENEY
          I didn't need to be saved.

179.        ON DECK - DAY

Tar bubbling under the heat of the sun. Cannons fizzing and
steaming as they are washed.

There's been a change of crews in the long-boats, and HOLLOM
and his men are now back on board. NAGEL is approaching from
one end of the narrow gang-way, HOLLOM from the other. NAGEL
pushes past, deliberately bumping HOLLOM, who stumbles,
clutching for the gunwale.

180.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK sees this outrageous act of indiscipline and yells out -

                    JACK
          Master at arms! Take that man below and
          clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings,
          defaulters at six bells.

181.        THE GREAT CABIN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

JACK stands behind his desk, brow like thunder. From outside
the sounds of the muster. HOLLOM stands in front of him,
twisting his hat between his hands.

                    JACK
          The man pushed past you without making
          his obedience. And yet you said nothing.

                    HOLLOM
          No, Sir, I intended to but the right
          words just didn't...

                    JACK
          'The right words'? He failed to salute
          you. It's deliberate insubordination.

HOLLOM looks at the floor, mumbles -

                    HOLLOM
          They don't like me, Sir.

                    JACK
          They what? Speak up, man!

HOLLOM raises his head and looks at JACK, his eyes shiny with
tears and when he opens his mouth the words tumble out in a
rush.

                    HOLLOM
          I've tried to get to know the men a bit,
          Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken
          a set against me. Always whispering when
          I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set
          that to rights, be tougher on them from
          now on.

                    JACK
          You can't make 'friends' with the
          foremast jacks, they'll despise you in
          the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant.
          It's leadership they want, strength,
          respect.

                    HOLLOM
          I'm very sorry, Sir.
                    JACK
          You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?

                    HOLLOM
              (smiling weakly)
          Twenty-five next Friday.

                    JACK
          You've failed to pass for lieutenant
          twice. You can't spend the rest of your
          life as a midshipman.

                    HOLLOM
          I'll try harder, Sir.

KILLICK helps JACK on with his full-dress uniform.

                    JACK
          Well, it's an unfortunate business,
          Hollom. Damned unfortunate.

KILLICK seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat
emphatically on JACK's head.

Jack turns and strides out of the cabin, HOLLOM following
slowly after him.

182.        QUARTERDECK, DOLDRUMS - DAY

The entire crew has been mustered. The uniformed officers
line the quarterdeck as JACK reads from the Articles of War.

                    JACK
          'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not
          capital, committed by any person or
          persons in the fleet... shall be punished
          according to the laws, and customs, of
          the sea.'
              (then, to NAGEL)
          Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man
          and yet you failed to salute an officer.
          You knew what you were doing. Have you
          anything to say in your defence?

NAGEL looks at the deck.

                     NAGEL
          No, Sir.

                     JACK
          Have his officers anything to say for
          him?

DAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks
wretched but says nothing.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Seize him up.

NAGEL is spread-eagled to the grating, his hands tied.

                    HOLLAR
          Seized up, Sir.

                    JACK
          One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.

The mate takes the leather cat-o-nine tails out of its red
bag.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

183.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK stands alone, tuning his fiddle. No matter how much he
turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. He tunes
some more and breaks it.

                    JACK
          Red hell...

184.        QUARTERDECK - DUSK

                    JACK (O.S.)
          ...and bloody death!

Every word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who
pretend to hear nothing.

185.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK is fitting a new string. Widen to reveal STEPHEN sitting
opposite with his cello.

                    STEPHEN
          I was merely remarking that you have
          always prided yourself on not being a
          flogging captain and this...
                    JACK
          I am not a "flogging captain". I have not
          once rigged the grating on this voyage,
          not once in twelve thousand miles.
          Besides, I wager you will find a deal
          more brutality on land.

Tightening the new string. The note escalating as he turns.

                    STEPHEN
          I'm not a party to it on land.

                    JACK
          Well you are party to it on my ship.
          Men must be governed. Often not wisely I
          grant you, but there are hierarchies even
          in nature, as you've often said yourself.

                    STEPHEN
          Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every
          tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.

                    JACK
              (trying to call a halt)
          Yes. Fine words I'm sure

                    STEPHEN
              (continues regardless)
          ...We are not animals and I for one am
          opposed to authority, that egg of misery
          and oppression..

                    JACK
          Very fine words Stephen, but In these
          current circumstances, hard-work and firm
          discipline is what keeps our little
          wooden world together.

                    STEPHEN
          And grog I suppose.

                            JACK
          Of course. What of it? Of course they
          have their grog!

                    STEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D)
          You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted
          Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even
          the midshipmen...

                    JACK
          The men will have their grog Stephen. It
          is part of the immemorial tradition of
          the service

                    STEPHEN
          Well a shameful tradition it is too. To
          have them pressed from their homes, kept
          in a permanent state of dull inebriation.

                       JACK
          Stephen...

                    STEPHEN
          ...confined for months in a wooden
          prison, Never more than a few hours sleep
          and flogged when drunken idleness drives
          them to....

                     JACK (forcefully)
          ...Stephen! I warn you that friend or no
          I will not have you talk of the service
          like that.

                    STEPHEN
          I am stating plain facts

                    JACK
              (finally explodes)
          Well I will not hear them! From you or
          anyone. You understand! Things are as
          they are for good or bad whether or not
          they have a place in your damned papist
          philosophy. If you are here to make music
          then sit down and play. If not be gone,
          for you have come
          to the wrong shop for anarchy!

In stony silence Stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves
past Killick, who is lurking as always by the door.

186.        SCUTTLEBUTT - DUSK

Something disturbs the dark surface of the water as HOLLOM
dips the ladle and fills his cup.

A sense of someone moving up behind him. HOLLOM turns
abruptly. It's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows. He
stares at HOLLOM as he backs away toward the ladder and
hurries below.

187.        BERTH DECK - DUSK
To reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the
berth deck, past HOWARD obsessively cleaning his pistol,
another man whittling with a knife, DAVIES adding another
link in the tattooed chain about BECKETT's middle.

No-one speaks as HOLLOM runs the gauntlet of their stares,
acutely aware of his own breathing. It now seems universally
to be held that he is the author of all the ship's
misfortune.

Nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging
gleaming wetly in the lamplight

Hollom's breath quickens. He stumbles on someone's dunnage,
almost trips but is caught before he falls. It's one of
NAGEL's mates.

                    NAGEL's MATE
          Careful, sir.

188.        MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - DUSK

HOLLOM comes in, wild-eyed and goes to his berth, breathing
hard. CALAMY, BLAKENEY & BOYLE look up from a tense game of
cards.

                    BLAKENEY
          Are you all right, Hollom?

HOLLOM shakes his head miserably, hyperventilating.

                    CALAMY
          He's not sick. He's useless. He's just
          dodging work.

                    BLAKENEY (angrily)
          Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know
          about anything?

CALAMY glares at BLAKENEY.

189.   INT STEPHEN'S ROOM - DUSK

A shot from the deck above.

STEPHEN looks up from his book "Di Consolazione Philosophae".
Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock
at the door.

Its Joe Plaice, looking agitated.
                    PLAICE
          Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr.
          Howard just shot a sea-monster!

190.        GANGWAY - DUSK

STEPHEN and PLAICE stride along to where the marine captain,
HOWARD, peers down into the water with one of his men.

                    HOWARD
          Doctor! The very man.

STEPHEN moves to the rail, looks out.

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          [   ] I wished you'd seen it for
          yourself, Doctor. The crew never seen
          anything like it.

On the glassy sea, a smudge of blood and some ripples

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          It was prodigious like a human, though
          bigger, might have been a sea-elephant,
          it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to
          hit the calf, I missed my mark.

                    STEPHEN
          Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men
          can't eat it or I can't dissect it,
          please do not shoot every creature you
          see.

STEPHEN stares back down at the ripples spreading over the
glassy sea.

191.        THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Wide, on the troubled ship, small yellow patches of light
visible from the gun-ports.

192.        BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

The men are lying in their hammocks when, from somewhere
outside, there comes an ungodly howling. It stops, then comes
again, exactly human in its pitch.

The crew look at one another. This is like no sound they've
ever heard.
The howling stops then comes again, from another direction.

193.          THE GREAT CABIN, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILLY listening.

                    KILLICK
          What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.

194.          QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK comes up from below.

                    JACK
          What is that abominable noise, for God's
          sake?

                    PULLINGS
          I have no idea, Sir.

                    MOWETT
          You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?

                    JACK
              (untypically cutting)
          The enemy cannot come on us without a
          wind, Mr. Mowett.

He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew. The
wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as STEPHEN joins the
group.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What do you make of it, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          I'm sure I've never heard the like.

The crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as
another anguished howl fills the night.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Perhaps it's the mother of the creature
          Mr. Howard shot.

                     JACK
          [    ] Creature?

                    STEPHEN
          [ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly.
          Though I have never known one with a cry
          like this.

A glance along at HOWARD on the gangway, as terrified as
anyone.

                    JACK
          Bosun. Fire off some flares.

195.        WIDE ON THE SHIP - NIGHT

Three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a
pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to
echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond.

196.        QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

The light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty
of sand. Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen
to the spot. Jack rounds on him.

                    JACK
          Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking
          of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.

Roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes
its flow.

Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power
of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. And when the
sound comes once more they all freeze.

JACK joins MOWETT at the taffrail. The thing is somewhere out
there, whatever it is.

                    MOWETT
          Perhaps some poor shipwreck?

He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)
          Ahoy! Is anyone there?

Part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply.
The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now
in the sky.

JACK turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his
own. It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white,
staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror
lies out there.
                    JACK
          Padeen. What are you doing on the
          quarterdeck?

He looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the
bottom of the ladder, some with weapons.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Below! All of you men below!
              (to MOWETT)
          Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep
          with their lamps on.

197.        LOWER DECK - NIGHT

Several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a
battle-lantern. Joe Plaice grim. Doudle wide-eyed. Higgins
with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever.

                    BLACK BILL
          Duppies make that noise.

                    KILLICK (indicating BILL)
          See. They know all about this in Africa.

                    DOUDLE
          What's a duppie?

                    BLACK BILL
          That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit
          can't get out. Him duppie now.

                    SLADE
          Captain don't even know what that noise
          be.

General nods of agreement.

                    DOUDLE
          Doctor neither, and he knows everything.

                    KILLICK
          Joe here's got the most experience in
          these matters, and new brains to boot,
          let's hear it from Joe.

All eyes on JOE PLAICE. He speaks from the shadows.

                    PLAICE
          It's the Jonah causing it. That howling
          thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship.
          He's calling it up, don't you see? Every
          time he's on watch the ship appears. You
          wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear
          any time tonight, and take us all
          straight to the hot-place.

Another shriek, closer now, seems to confirm JOE's bizarre
theory.

198.        MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH - NIGHT

The boys sit together. None of them look at HOLLOM, who sits
pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his
stomach.

199.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

As the howling continues, STEPHEN looks through a number of
books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what
they're experiencing.

As JACK looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a
picture in one of STEPHEN's books.

He picks it up.

Close on the picture - it's an engraving of a giant squid,
its tentacles wrapped around a ship.

Back on JACK holding the picture up to STEPHEN.

                    JACK
          You don't think...?

There is a knock on the cabin door and BLAKENEY enters,
agitated.

                    BLAKENEY (to STEPHEN)
          It's Mr. Hollom, sir, you better come
          quick.

200.   MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH

HOLLOM writhing in agony on the floor, STEPHEN trying to calm
him, shouting for assistance from the midshipmen and then
from PADEEN.

                    STEPHEN
          Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself.
          Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen
201.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT.

Stephen is writing some case notes in his journal, when Jack
puts his head around the door.

Stephens POV: The lamp, lighting his face from below and to
one side, gives a strange lopsided twist to Jacks smile

                    JACK
          Well?

                    STEPHEN
          There's nothing physically wrong with
          him. He thinks he's been cursed by the
          0men.

                    JACK
          Then he probably has been. Sailors will
          abide a great deal, but never a Jonah.
          It's like a white crow - the others peck
          it to death.

                    STEPHEN
          A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.

                    JACK
          I desired to save you the trouble of
          looking for a cure. No doubt it will all
          be sorted by the morning.


202      FORECASTLE, LATER - NIGHT

BLAKENEY stands near the bows peering out into the night. A
figure approaches from behind and lays a hand in his
shoulder.

BLAKENEY nearly jumps out of his skin.

                    BLAKENEY
          Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are
          you better now?

HOLLOM's breathing does indeed seem easier.

                    HOLLOM
          Much better, thank you.

                    BLAKENEY
          I think the creature is going away.
                    HOLLOM
          I am sure of it.

He reaches down, picks up a 12 pound cannonball.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          You've always been very kind to me.
          Goodbye, Blakeney.

With a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps
over the side the cannonball in his arms.

BLAKENEY looks down with shock to see HOLLOM's pale face
receding from him into the depths. It's a moment before he
gathers his wits to shout -

                    BLAKENEY
          Man overboard!

203.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The ship's company are mustered on deck. JACK stands at the
sword rack lectern. KILLICK hands him a Bible open at the
story of Jonah.

JACK looks, then hands it back to KILLICK.

                    JACK
          The fact is, [   ] not all of us become
          the men we once hoped we might be. But we
          are all God's creatures. If some of us
          thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill
          of him, or failed him in respect of
          fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness,
          Lord, and we ask for his.

Close on the faces of the crew - KILLICK, HIGGINS, NAGEL,
CALAMY, BLAKENEY and finally Stephen who is staring oddly at
Jack, as though holding him partly responsible for this
latest tragedy.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Amen.

                    CREW (mumble ashamedly)
          Amen.

The men on deck remain standing, heads bowed, observing a
minute's silence, as the sky begins to pale, and the white
disc of the sun appears above them.
FASTER DOUDLE is the first to look up, followed by others -
the terrible sound has gone and a small puff of wind is
stirring the mainsail.

204. HOUR GLASS

The sand runs out of the half-hour glass.

                    BONDEN
          Strike eight bells.

                    QUARTERMASTER (to the marine sentry)
          Turn the glass and strike the bell.

The glass is inverted. The bell tolls.

205.        SURPRISE AT SEA - DAY

The ship moves through a tropical squall. Men rig a sail to
catch the water, others appear with barrels and tubs,
anything to catch the precious rain.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

206.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Sea birds swarming over a shoal of fish in the foreground as
the cry of the distant lookout carries faintly across the
sea.

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
          Land-ho!

207.        GANGWAY - DAY

BLAKENEY runs along the gangway, past STEPHEN, en route to
the quarterdeck.

                     BLAKENEY
          Give you joy, sir! We have raised the
          Galapagos!

208.     MONTAGE oF TELESCOPE VIEWS, GALAPAGOS - DAY

There's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a
world just born. The wild creatures that inhabit the lava
flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises,
iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of
exotic animals and plants.
209.        QUARTERDECK/FORECASTLE/TOPS - DAY

The ship fairly bristles with telescopes.

210.   FORECASTLE

A small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope.

                    HIGGINS (looking)
          Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks
          and lizards.

DOUDLE takes the telescope.

                    DOUDLE
          Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't
          natural.

211.   QUARTERDECK

STEPHEN and BLAKENEY side by side. From both their faces we
sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for
the first time.

                    STEPHEN
          How extraordinary.

                       BLAKENEY
          What, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          Those birds!

He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds
waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          A species of cormorant. But apparently
          flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe
          that is unknown to science.

BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds
then drifts back to the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.

                    STEPHEN
          They are a type of iguana I should think,
          and therefore vegetarian.
His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is
wholly absorbed in the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          Will you catch one?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some
          eggs.

                    BLAKENEY
          I mean the great lizards.

                    STEPHEN
          Oh!

Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to
BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          I should think a pair of them. Then you
          can present one of their offspring to the
          king.

                    BONDEN
          Ha! There's one going for a swim.

                    STEPHEN
          No. Iguanas are land animals.

                    BONDEN
          Not these ones.

The prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened,
begin diving into the water.

                    STEPHEN (O.S.)
          By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new
          species in as many minutes.

He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between
the lookout and the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          What is all that confounded bellowing?

                    JACK
          All hands about ship!

BLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way by
hands rushing to get at the sails.

                    NEHEMIAH SLADE
          By your leave sir, by your leave.

                    HOLLAR (distant)
          Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets -
          mainsail haul!

As the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men
aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands.

212.        IN THE LEE OF THE SHIP'S HULL (TIME-LAPSE) - DAY

The whaleboat has come alongside.

Men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped
aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting.

                    HOGG
          God bless you. Thank you, shipmates.

213.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

HOGG, the senior whaler, sits with his mates, relating his
story to JACK and the officers.

                    HOGG
          We was coming back for fresh lines, hid
          in that inlet, yonder. Black-three
          master. Bit beamy and raised in the
          stern.

Meaningful looks among Jack and his men. Its definitely the
Acheron he's describing [   ]

Hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, and
passes it back to BLAKENEY for a refill.

                    HOGG (CONT'D)
          Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil
          they stole. Then the bastards...

                    ALLEN
              (cuffs him)
          No swearing on the quarterdeck.

                    JACK
              (waves ALLEN away)
          Go on.
                     HOGG
           ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and
           headed off, bunch of fugging pirates.

Looking pointedly at Allen

                     [      ]

                     JACK
           And her course?

                     HOGG
           Maybe a point south of west. Following
           the rest of the whaling fleet.

                     JACK (rising)
           Mr. Mowett, these men to be entered on
           the ship's books. Mr. Allen, lay a course
           west sou'west.

As ALLEN hurries away shouting orders -

                     PULLINGS
           Should we not take on fresh supplies,
           Sir? Those tortoises...

                     JACK (overlapping, impatient)
           There's not a moment to lose, Mr.
           Pullings.

He leaves the quarterdeck and goes below, STEPHEN following.

214.   IN THE GREAT CABIN

JACK has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his
charts. STEPHEN hurries in.

                     STEPHEN
           Have you forgotten your promise?

                     JACK
               (not looking up)
           Subject to the requirements of the
           service, Stephen. I could not in all
           conscience delay for the sake of an
           iguano or a... giant peccary -
           interesting no doubt, but of no immediate
           application.

                     STEPHEN (overlap)
          How can you dismiss, out of hand, the
          bounty of nature? Knowledge that... that
          will help to progress...

                    JACK (overlap)
          I can see nothing on shore that will
          progress our mission.

                    STEPHEN (overlap)
          But how can we possibly know what lies
          [ ] on these islands, perhaps some
          knowledge that may save life, that...

                    JACK (overlap)
          I will tell you how to save lives
          Stephen. Inform me how to guide this
          ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40
          gun frigate. That is the job in hand sir.

STEPHEN swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise.

                    STEPHEN
          Well perhaps there's an opportunity to
          serve both our objectives. As I
          understand it you mean to go round the
          end of this long island, then start your
          voyage. I could walk across it, be on the
          other side long before...

JACK shakes his head.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          I would walk briskly, pausing only for
          important measurements and almost
          certainly making valuable discoveries...

                    JACK (interrupts)
          If wind and tide had been against us I
          should have said yes. They are not and I
          am obliged to say no.
              (with finality)
          No.

STEPHEN is livid. Betrayed.

                    STEPHEN
          I see. So after all this time in your
          service I must simply be content to form
          part of this belligerent expedition,
          hurry past inestimable wonders, bent
          solely on destruction...
                    JACK
          ...you forget yourself, sir.

                    STEPHEN
          No Jack, You have forgotten your self.
          You once believed in the rights of each
          individual man no matter how useless or
          lowly. But it seems to me now that the
          long exercise of power has brought you to
          the point where even a solemn promise...

                    JACK
          The promise was conditional.

                    STEPHEN
          ...a promise to a friend of ten years
          standing who has stood by you and
          supported you....

                    JACK (overlapping)
          I command a King's ship, not a private
          yacht...

                    STEPHEN
          ...across half the worlds oceans often at
          risk to his own life

                    JACK
          ...and we have no time for your damned
          hobbies, sir!

"Hobbies". So that is JACK's honest view of STEPHEN's
lifetime of work in science. He bows slightly, then leaves.

215         QUARTERDECK - DUSK

STEPHEN stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands
recede in the distance.

News of the violent argument has spread and there is many a
sympathetic glance, which further humiliates STEPHEN.

BLAKENEY approaches him carrying something carefully in the
palm of his hand.

                    BLAKENEY
          Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on
          the deck.

He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown
beetle.

                      BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
            I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir.

                      STEPHEN
            I'm sure of it.

                      BLAKENEY
            Were you to have walked all day on the
            island, you might never have come across
            it.

                      STEPHEN
            That is more than likely, sure.

BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN.

                      BLAKENEY
            You can have it.

                      STEPHEN
            Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation,
then retreats.

216       IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits alone at the table. KILLICK enters with toasted
cheese for two.

                      KILLICK
            No music? That's a shame

He sets down the toasted cheese.

                      KILLICK (CONT'D)
            I'll just leave the one plate then, if
            himself won't be joining.

                      JACK
            Yes, Killick. Just the one.

JACK cuts himself a portion, scowling at STEPHEN's cello
which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats.

217.      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN takes a dropper, carefully measures twenty drops of
laudanum to a glass of water, and drinks.
218.        LOOKOUT - DAY

The lookout leaning out from the cross-trees.

                    DOUDLE (shouting)
          On deck there. Object fine on the
          starboard bow.

219.        THE SHIP LYING STATIONARY - DAY

A barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up
the side of the ship.

220.   IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP

JACK comes down, accompanied by ALLEN, the acknowledged
expert in these matters.

Others gather round, including HOGG the whaler, inspecting
the stencilled markings.

                    ALLEN
          Martha's vineyard.

                    HOGG
          No, this here's from Boston. I was
          married there once.

                    ALLEN
          Any road, it's a Yankee barrel.

                    HOGG
          What they call a Bedford Hog in New
          England.

                    MOWETT (to JACK)
          The Acheron touched at Boston.

                    HOGG
          And it's not been in the water more than
          a week.

                    ALLEN
          One can't say with any accuracy but...

                    HOGG
          Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on
          it, and the dowels is sound.

221.        ON THE QUARTERDECK - DAY
JACK returns to his post.

                    JACK
          Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.

TOM PULLINGS watches him. There has been a change amongst the
officers and crew toward JACK. His relentless driving after
the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession
not shared by his exhausted men.

He is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the
gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea,
sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the
earth.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

222.        LADDER (TIME LAPSE) - DAY

A wild wind humming through the rigging as STEPHEN goes
topside.

223.        FORECASTLE - DAY

He finds various hands making the boats secure.

                    PLAICE
          Have you seen the bird, doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          I have not - no bird these many days.
          What kind of a bird?

                    PLAICE
          A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps
          a prodigious great mew. He has been
          following the ship since... there he is,
          crossing our wake!

224.        ON THE GANGWAY - DAY

STEPHEN runs along the gangway to get a clearer view,
checking himself when he sees JACK on the quarterdeck.

Their eyes meet. The quarterdeck is JACK's domain now, and
STEPHEN avoids it.

Then, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears.

It's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and
flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the
gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails.

STEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning
forward to get a better view.

At the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway,
HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The
bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.

Again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently
uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the
water.

STEPHEN sags to the deck. A shout. People running. Blood
spreading across the white of his shirt. HOWARD there by his
side.

                    HOWARD
          My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird
          dropped low. I didn't see you there!

JACK is there, shouting -

                    JACK
          Calamy! Get Higgins!
              (then turning to BONDEN)
          Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.

STEPHEN gets slowly up, hands reaching to help him, HOWARD in
the background distraught, explaining to anyone who'll listen
what happened.

                    STEPHEN
          It's all right, I am quite capable of
          walking.

He tries to stand, crumples.

225.        STEPHEN's CABIN - DAY

HIGGINS presses clumsily around the wound as STEPHEN lies on
the bed, his abdomen rigid, his breathing laboured. JACK
watches from the door.

                    STEPHEN
          You will just make it worse... by
          prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got
          at... except by opening me up.

A violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how
impossible this will be under sail.

As STEPHEN lapses into unconsciousness, HIGGINS looking
alarmed, approaches JACK.

                     HIGGINS (a whisper)
           The bullet took a piece of shirt in with
           it. Unless it is removed it will
           suppurate and fester.

                     JACK
           Are you equal to the task?

                     HIGGINS
           I'll need to read up on the Doctor's
           books, like. Study some pictures he has,
           get my bearings. Be better on land, but
           I'll manage somehow.

JACK looks away from the alcoholic HIGGINS back to STEPHEN.

226.   OUTSIDE THE CABIN

JACK passes an anxious crowd of the ship's company: BLAKENEY,
JOE PLAICE, KILLICK and HOWARD.

                     JACK
           You men get about your business.

There are dark looks in JACK's direction as he retreats to
his cabin.

227.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK throws a chart on the table.

With his protractor he marches out great strides west into
the Pacific from the Galapagos Islands and marks the ship's
position - they are maybe a hundred miles from the Galapagos,
ahead, open sea until the Marquesas.

228.       INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN - DUSK

Lying on his bed, in some pain, STEPHEN hears thudding feet,
shouted orders.

In his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. His
pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus.

There's a knock on the door and JEMMY DUCKS appears with a
mug of soup and some biscuit.
                    JEMMY DUCKS
          ...sail on the horizon, sir. Hull down,
          running west. It may be a couple of days
          before we can catch her.

STEPHEN nods, all he wants is quiet.

JEMMY DUCKS retreats, as STEPHEN swigs from a little bottle
of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively
blocking out the noise from above.

A smile to PADEEN, like a farewell, and he closes his eyes.

229.        FORECASTLE - DUSK

JACK, telescope to his eye, studies the distant ship as
PULLINGS jumps down from the ratlines to the deck.

                     PULLINGS
          It might be the Acheron. If we put on
          more sail we'd come up with her before
          nightfall.

JACK lowers the telescope, turns his back on PULLINGS,
strangely abstracted.

                     PULLINGS (CONT'D)
               (to his back)
          Do you wish me to set the topgallants?
               (no reply)
          Sir?

A long silence. Then JACK walks away.

PULLINGS stares perplexed from JACK's retreating figure to
the distant chase.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO -

230.        INTERIOR STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAWN

Early morning light on the interior of the cabin. PADEEN is
asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair.

STEPHEN himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his
mouth open, no colour in his face.

The sea is relatively calm. From outside the sound of the
bosun's orders, over rattling blocks and pulleys.
                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          ...Clap on now! Every rope an end...
          Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You
          grass-combing lubber!

MOWETT comes in, sees STEPHEN, and takes him for dead.

                    MOWETT
              (shouts outside)
          Davies! Slade!

Two big men come in behind him. PADEEN wakes, confused and
pushes them away, moving protectively to the doctor's side.

The commotion disturbs STEPHEN. His eyes open. Like a dead
man just come back to life.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)
          Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move
          you onto a stretcher?

STEPHEN swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of
things.

231.        A GALAPAGOS ISLAND - DAY

A giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the
stony beach.

At its head, STEPHEN is carried in a litter up to where a
tent has been set up above the high-water mark.

His P.O.V. as JACK appears in the blue sky above him.

                    STEPHEN
          Tell me this wasn't on my account?

                     JACK
              (dead pan)
          No. It was because of Higgins.
              (beat)
          Can't have him poking around in your
          belly without a solid platform to work
          on.

He ducks as they enter -

232.        THE HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

In the creamy light, they lay STEPHEN down on a recently-
constructed wooden operating table.

HIGGINS squats on the ground, rummaging through various large
sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece
of Hessian.

                    JACK
          All set, Higgins?

STEPHEN grabs JACK's sleeve.

                    STEPHEN
          Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.

Jack frowns, unsure what he means by this.

EXT. THE TENT - NIGHT

PADEEN stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping
at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious.

INT. THE TENT - NIGHT

STEPHEN sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of
chests, his back against a coil of rope. In front of him,
suspended by pulleys, LAMB and NAGEL have set up a large
gilt-framed mirror.

Beside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and
scalpels.

                    STEPHEN
              (To Jack)
          [ ] You are sure you have a head and a
          stomach for this kind of thing?

                    JACK (smiles)
          My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and
          wounds since I was a little boy.

                    STEPHEN
          Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when
          I give the word.


STEPHEN begins first with the knife, then the probe - the
grind of metal on living bone.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          You will have to raise the rib, Higgins.
          Take a good grip with the square
          retractor. Up. Harder, harder.
              (to himself)
          Snip the cartilage.

The metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure.
          Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier.
          Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press.

JACK closes his eyes. STEPHEN draws in his breath, arches his
back, and it's done.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          There she is.

He pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his
shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Is that all of it?

The bloody piece of shirt is handed to HIGGINS who matches it
to the hole in STEPHEN's old shirt.

                    HIGGINS
          Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir.

                    STEPHEN
          Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the
          retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain,
          while I swab.

HIGGINS helps JACK into a chair, pressing his head down
between his knees. After a moment, and a few deep breaths,
JACK looks up. STEPHEN smiles at him. A hint of surly
triumph.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

235.        STEPHEN'S TENT - DAY

Through a gap in the door of his tent STEPHEN can see the
distant ship at anchor. Repairs are underway, guns being
unloaded, stores and fresh water being ferried aboard.

BLAKENEY comes in, followed by PADEEN with a some numbered
boxes hung round his neck.
                    STEPHEN
          My goodness, what is this?

BLAKENEY starts rolling up the sides of the tent as PADEEN
unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of
vegetation in it.

                    BLAKENEY
          Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing
          some collecting for you. The beetles each
          come with a specimen of plant they were
          found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There
          he goes.

He finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection
of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the
poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS.

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks.
          Captain says we can keep them in the
          chicken coop.

Then, producing a notebook -

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          And I made a few notes if you want to see
          them.

STEPHEN flips the pages:

No 22. Large square black beetle with pincers. Found under
rock. Eats earthworms.

                    STEPHEN
          'Pon my word you have the makings of a
          true naturalist.

BLAKENEY is flattered but unsure.

                    BLAKENEY
          Well sir, perhaps I could combine them,
          and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist,
          like yourself?

                                    [   ]

Stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into
a sitting position.
                    STEPHEN
          Shall we take a tour of your aviary?

BLAKENEY looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdomen.

                    BLAKENEY
          Should you really be up?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Padeen!

PADEEN puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping
and offers STEPHEN a hand. STEPHEN pulls himself painfully to
his feet and starts buttoning his shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
              (To Blakeney)
          How long does the Captain intend that we
          stay here, do you know?

ON THE BEACH - DAY

JACK is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket
on the shore, with a canvas ball and stumps made of
driftwood.

                    JACK
          Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great
          hurry.

                     STEPHEN
          But surely, we must make haste for the
          Marquesas?

                    JACK
          It may not have been the Acheron that we
          sighted. Nor can we be sure of her
          destination.
              (looks away)
          No, I think we shall go home now, before
          peace breaks out with France, God forbid.

He's making light of what has been a huge and far-reaching
decision.

                    STEPHEN
          But how will it sit with the Admiralty?
          To have spent six months in a fruitless
          pursuit and then come home empty-handed?
                    JACK
          "Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What
          about these plants and animals which
          Blakeney has been collecting? The British
          museum will need an entire new wing for
          'em.

STEPHEN regards him gravely, shaking his head.

                    STEPHEN
          I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a
          debt I can never repay.

He is absolutely sincere about this, to JACK's great
embarrassment.

                    JACK
          Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something
          prickly and hard to eradicate.

                    STEPHEN
          A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise:
          Testudo Aubreii!

237.        SURPRISE CAMP - DAWN

STEPHEN, BLAKENEY and PADEEN leave the camp on STEPHEN's
first day of exploration. They are armed with nets, baskets
and a day's supply of food and water.

STEPHEN walks slightly stooped, leaning on a walking stick.

238.        COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A strange and wonderful landscape lies before them, with its
organically-shaped lava flows and alien-looking flora and
fauna.

Everywhere STEPHEN looks there are creatures unique to the
islands. He is in his element, collecting specimens which
PADEEN carefully stores in the baskets.

BLAKENEY has his telescope trained on some distant humps.

                    BLAKENEY
          Doctor, would you think it very
          unscientific of me to ride on the back of
          one of those tortoises.

                    STEPHEN
          No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an
          experiment of absolutely vital
          importance. But afterwards, I do desire
          to find that flightless cormorant,
          assuming that is what it is, and that I
          still have strength enough to catch it.

239.        A VALLEY - DAY

BLAKENEY gets astride a giant tortoise and burns his bottom
on its scorching hot shell.

240.        LAVA BEDS - DAY

STEPHEN with his telescope taking notes on bird-life.

241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY

The huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a
butterfly in evening light.

242.        A HEADLAND - DAY

Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of
distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain.

The group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the
headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming
up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition.

243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY

STEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the
hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near
the crest - the cormorant.

On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun
to bleed again.

Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry.

244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE

Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances
above him.

Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on.

STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the
crest just above him.
245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND

A clearing. There is movement in the bushes.

STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and
enters a clearing.

He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing.

He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and
PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again.

STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He
picks it up.

Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY
gave him aboard the Surprise.

Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature
to eye level.

His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind
it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape.

The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a
bay.

The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's
the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor.

246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

BLAKENEY urging STEPHEN to hurry as they make their way
through the darkening landscape. All kinds of creatures are
appearing around them, and every few yards STEPHEN pauses to
examine something.

                     BLAKENEY
           Sir, you must hurry!

                     STEPHEN
           A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any
           ship's captain.

He's breathing hard, exhausted.

                     BLAKENEY
           You must carry him, Padeen!

PADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries.
                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          Leave them! We must get back to the ship.

STEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is already
divesting PADEEN of his load.

247.        COUNTRYSIDE - LAST LIGHT

PADEEN carrying STEPHEN 'piggy-back', BLAKENEY out ahead
urging them on.

247a   THE DISCARDED COLLECTING BOXES

A variety of small bugs and animals crawling free

248      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair',
gripping the table and BLAKENEY's good arm for support.
Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small
items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and
insects - and places them in ordered piles around his
microscope.

All about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure -
the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of
bare feet on the deck above.

He holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it
with his magnifying glass when JACK enters.

                    JACK
          I forgot to ask you - did you see your
          bird?

STEPHEN's eye grossly enlarged through the lens.

                    STEPHEN
          I did not. My greatest discovery was your
          phantom.

                    JACK
          Indeed it was, I'm sorry...

                    STEPHEN
              (waving the magnifying glass)
          Not a bit of it. William and I made a
          unique discovery.

Handing JACK the jar and magnifying glass.
                     STEPHEN (CONT'D)
           Tell him, Mr. Blakeney.

                     BLAKENEY (beaming)
           It's a rare phasmid, Sir.

JACK inspects the stick. It winks at him.

                        JACK
           A phasmid?

                     BLAKENEY
           It's an insect disguised as a stick.

JACK stares at the creature.

                     BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
           In order to confuse a predator.

JACK looks up at STEPHEN.

249.   BAY, GALAPAGOS - NIGHT

The Surprise alive with crewmen on the deck and in the
rigging. Shouts and commands drift across the water as she
turns and heads out from the bay.

249a         GANGWAY - SAME TIME

JACK strides along the quarterdeck towards the forecastle
issuing a stream of orders -

                     JACK
           Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint
           we have. I want six men with brushes
           slung over the side.
               (moving on)
           Doudle!

                        DOUDLE
           Yessir.

JACK hands him a piece of paper with a sketch on it.

                     JACK
           Get your sail makers working on this.
           Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet
           every seven feet.

                        DOUDLE
            Aye, Sir.

He shouts to HOGG who, with a few men, is manhandling a large
metal cauldron from the ballast to the gun-deck.

                      JACK
                (to HOGG)
            Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire
            in it.
                (shouts)
            Mr. Calamy!

                         CALAMY
            Aye, Sir.

                      JACK
            Once we're underway, replace some of the
            sails with the oldest, most patched set
            we have.

                      CALAMY
            They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll
            need some men to move all the clutter.

                      JACK
            Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The
            more mess the better.

249B.    SIDE OF THE SHIP,. NIGHT

The ship powers ahead as men swing in harnesses above the
racing water, painting out the Nelson chequer.

249C.    ON DECK.   NIGHT

NAGEL positions the great cauldron amidships as men come up
from below with old barrels and bits of rope.

                         CALAMY
            Haul away!

On the gangway, Men under CALAMY's instructions haul on
ropes, pulling up the old patched sails.

The sails lead us up to

250.    CROSSTREES - NIGHT

JACK, PULLINGS and the whaler HOGG scan the dark horizon.

                         HOGG
          There, Sir. A mainmast toplight.

JACK has to use a telescope.

                    JACK
          You've got good eyes, Hogg.

Shouts down to the helm -

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Bonden, set a course west-south-west.
              (to PULLINGS)
          We'll drop below the horizon and come up
          on the other side of him, let him think
          he's seen us first.

251.        SURPRISE - DAWN

First light reveals the results of an overnight
transformation - from a naval warship to a shambolic-looking
Portuguese whaler.

The gunwales are painted an untidy ochre and the gun-ports
hidden behind broad strips of canvas.

The sails are patched and ragged, the forecastle cluttered
with barrels. Smoke billows from a cauldron amidships.

On deck and in the rigging, there's a quarter of the normal
complement of men, all of them dressed in purser's slops.

252.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

A bemused STEPHEN looks about him as he approaches JACK.

                    STEPHEN
          I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's
          clothing

                    JACK
          A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave
          me the idea.

                    STEPHEN
          I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.

                    JACK
          No? Well this one is.

253.        BERTH DECK - DAWN
HOWARD and his marines change out of their smart uniforms,
into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much
to the amusement of the passing sailors.

                    CREW MEN AD LIB
          Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is
          there a skirt comes with it?

254.        GUN-DECK - DAWN

Men are checking the breechings of the great guns and
chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical,
more deadly.

The armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of
sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at
the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes
at their feet.

Another team check and load pistols by the score.

254.        MIDSHIPMEN'S QUARTERS - DAWN

Alone, BLAKENEY awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from
its scabbard. It glints momentarily in the lamp-light.

CALAMY enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy
when he sees BLAKENEY.

                    BLAKENEY [ ]
          It's all right. Permission to boast.
          You're to lead the boarders from the
          forecastle. Congratulations.

                          CALAMY
          Thank you.

                    BLAKENEY
          You'll make lieutenant out of this.

The others come in.

                    BOYLE
          He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant
          Peter Calamy.

Oohs and aahs from all.

                          BLAKENEY
              [       ]
          Then I'll see you at the forecastle,
          'Lieutenant'.

                    CALAMY
          That's not your station.

BLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his eye.

                    BLAKENEY
          But naturally I'll board with you?

                    CALAMY
          I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders.

BLAKENEY is devastated.

Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement.

                    RYE
          She's seen us!

256.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly
visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running
up her backstay.

                     MOWETT
          She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give
          the order?

                    JACK
          No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but
          panicky and disorganized, like a whaler
          might do.

Allen smiles at this unintended slight

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          No offence, Mr. Hogg.

257.        WIDE ON THE SHIPS - DAY

A show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away
from the Acheron. As she presents her stern we see her new
name: Malacca.

258.        QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Through his telescope, JACK looks back at the Acheron in
pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck.
                    JACK
              (to Mowett)
          Run up Portuguese colours.
              (then down to the gun-deck)
          Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em.

BLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking
flushed and angry.

                    BLAKENEY
          May I speak with you, Sir.

                    JACK
          No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers
          here.

                    BLAKENEY
          Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding
          party, I wanted to say -

                    JACK
              (interrupts)
          I know what you want to say and my answer
          is no. I promised your mother I would
          return you in one piece and I have
          already failed her on that score. You
          will command a gun and then retire to
          defend the quarterdeck here with Dr.
          Maturin.

                      BLAKENEY
          But sir -

                    JACK (cutting in)
          Go to your station, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears
burning his eyes.

A moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the
Acheron opens up with her bow-chasers. An 18 pound shot
screams past the side of the Surprise to land with a column
of spray just off their bows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Good shooting. Remind me to press her bow
          gunner, Mr. Pullings.

The second ball takes down some rigging.
                     JACK (CONT'D)
          Start the water and throw some barrels
          overboard.

He goes below.

259.   WAIST - DAY

Barrels go overboard and pumps spout streams of water over
the side as JACK runs down to

260.   THE GUN-DECK

The great majority of men are gathered here, more than a
hundred of them crammed together with their muskets and
sabres, listening to the odd thump from topsides as another
ball from the Acheron hits home.

CALAMY and his gang of young tykes are squashed in there
somewhere, BOYLE, WILLIAMS, ADDISON and the rest, eyes
shining with nervousness and wild anticipation, as JACK
addresses his men, who shout encouragement, ad lib, in every
pause.

                    JACK
              (plus the men ad lib)
          We're a long way from home. (Right you
          are, Captain!) A long way from anywhere,
          (Too true!) But if Britain rules the
          waves she rules these waves too. (Right
          she does!) And the blow we shall deal for
          his Majesty here will be felt just as
          keenly (I'll say it will) aye - and
          cheered just as loudly ('specially by the
          wimmin!) - as any dealt at Trafalgar or
          Cape St. Vincent.


The camera moves over the upturned faces, PLAICE, NAGEL,
DOUDLE, KILLICK, the midshipmen, the powder-monkeys, the
whole fellowship of the ship. And finally STEPHEN watching
JACK doing what he does best: transmitting his own
fearlessness into other men - the total warrior, the
consummate leader.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I don't say it will be easy. She's twice
          the men we have and they'll sell their
          lives dearly. But every man here is worth
          three of Boney's privateers, and I know
          there's not a faint heart among you.
CALAMY pipes up -

                    CALAMY
          Three cheers for the Captain.

                    MEN (deafening)
          Huzzah huzzah huzzah!

On CALAMY, cheering like a kid at a football match as...

261.          QUARTERDECK - DAY

Another well-placed shot from the Acheron smashes through the
rigging, sending down a shower of rope and cordage.

JACK is back at his station by the wheel, the Acheron little
more than a half a mile astern, the figure of the captain in
his black coat clearly visible.

JACK studies the looming black vessel, then turns and crosses
to BONDEN at the helm. BONDEN nods, lifting his hands from
the wheel as JACK grips the curved timber decisively, taking
the strain.

He feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up
to the sails then back to the Acheron. STEPHEN appears beside
him, casually smoking a cigar. He offers one to Jack, who
declines

                     [   ]

Another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them, but
neither man flinches. KILLICK appears with two cups of
coffee, and in his belt a brace of pistols.

                    KILLICK
          I took the liberty, Doctor.

                     STEPHEN
          [    ] Thank you, Killick.

JACK steers one-handed as he sips his coffee.

                    JACK
          Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in
          order.

Another shot through the sails.

                     MOWETT
           A poem, Sir?
                             [   ]
               (after a moment's reflection)
           'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art,
           To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,

A ball goes howling past the ship, MOWETT winces.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)
           Then might I, with unrivalled strains,
           deplore,
           Th'impervious horrors of a leeward
           shore.'

JACK smiles, nods.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)
           'Transfixed with terror at th'approaching
           doom...'

                        JACK
           What!

                     MOWETT
               (apologetic)
           ...they were only people of the merchant
           service, of-course, Sir.

262.   P.O.V. ACHERON

She's now less than five hundred yards from their stern, and
gaining.

263.    QUARTERDECK

JACK turns back to MOWETT.

                     JACK
           We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the
           Portuguese colours and run up the Jack...
           Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports,
           and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away
           aloft.

The British Jack rises to the masthead replacing the
Portuguese colours, as PULLINGS descends to the gun-deck.

264. SHIP'S SIDE -

The black muzzles appear with a low rumbling sound, as
265.   QUARTERDECK

JACK, with a wink to MOWETT, yells at the top of his voice

                       JACK
             Helm's a lee!

....and spins the wheel hard to starboard.

266.   THE SURPRISE

Wide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of
the oncoming Acheron.

267.   POV ACHERON DAY

Confused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her
forecastle, somewhere a drum beating.

268 + 269.    DELETED

270.   THE SURPRISE QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK hands the wheel to BONDEN.

                       JACK
             Run us down her larboard side then cut
             across her wake!
                 (shouts down to the gun deck)
             Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're
             broadside on!

271. - THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

Wide, to see the Surprise turning downwind, back towards the
Acheron, so they will pass broadside to broadside [   ] no
more than thirty yards apart.

272. QUARTERDECK/ GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

Through a furious exchange of musket fire JACK runs down the
ladder to the gun-deck-

                       JACK
             Fire as she bears! Every gun to
             concentrate on her mainmast!

Through the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes
visible. Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the
crews are unprepared and disorganized.
                      PULLINGS
            On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as
            you sight her!

As the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron
becomes visible.

273. THE SURPRISE GUNS

Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame
spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising.

274.    VIEW OF THE ACHERON

With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls,
dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling
over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports.

275. GUNDECK/QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE -

Cheers from the crew. Jack yelling up the companionway

                      JACK
            Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard!

276.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous
dragging weight of their mainmast.

BONDEN wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the
exposed, vulnerable stern.

277.    DELETED

277A.   GUNDECK, SURPRISE

                      JACK
            Fire at will!

278.    GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

In random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the
Acheron's stern. Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood
and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now
open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past.

279.    QUARTERDECK

JACK climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to BONDEN -
                      JACK
            Lay me alongside!

280.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships,
spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at
point-blank range.

The crew throw grappling hooks.

281..   QUARTERDECK

                      JACK
            Boarders away!

And he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following
after him.

282.    FORECASTLE

CALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and
forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging
their blades.

283.    QUARTERDECK

An agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside
STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men,
ready to ferry the wounded below.

284.    ON THE ACHERON

As the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face
withering fire from the enemy. A dozen men go down, some of
them fatally wounded. Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and
HORNER in quick succession.

The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back
at them.

JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine,
TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot.

LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to
devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS
protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the
hip.

JACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling,
swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other
with barely room to fall.

The Acherons are gradually forced back across their
quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship.

285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON

JACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy
pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through
the sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK
and killing the pikeman.

To either side, privateers are trying to reach them,
shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.

Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and
foe alike.

KILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and
from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.

AWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-
cleaver right and left.

286.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

A commander of the privateers notes the poorly defended
Surprise, and leads a counter-attack over onto her
quarterdeck.

                     CALAMY
           Look to our quarter-deck!

287. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

BLAKENEY, dirk in hand, turns to face them, as does HOWARD
and his men, but they are gravely outnumbered.

288.   FORECASTLE, ACHERON

CALAMY sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the
Surprise, calling for others to follow.

                     Calamy
           This way! Follow me!

289. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

STEPHEN, PADEEN and JOE PLAICE appear from below. STEPHEN
picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer
lunging at CAPTAIN HOWARD. The man drops, a neat hole in his
forehead. A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's
surprising skill.

CALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees
stabbing at the legs of the attackers.

290.   WAIST, ACHERON

JACK, BONDEN and DAVIES are driving a wedge toward the stern,
the defenders falling back in disarray.

291.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

PULLINGS and MOWETT fight side-by-side.

A swivel-gun mounted on the taff-rail is swung to face them.

The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket
ball hits him, again fired by STEPHEN.

292.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE/ACHERON

CALAMY, BLAKENEY and their group force the counter-attack
back onto the deck of the Acheron. The two boys fight as a
team as they move toward the stern.

292.   SIDE OF THE ACHERON

Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack.
Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall.

293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

JEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the
grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale.

294.   IN THE WATER

Oil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,
clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.

295.   WAIST OF THE SHIP

Cheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many
languages, some beg for mercy, others fight on.

296.   BELOW DECKS

JACK moves alone, down to the berth deck. He smashes the
chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.

Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's
stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.

He makes his way through to the Great Cabin.

297.   GREAT CABIN, ACHERON

Four privateers look up as JACK bursts in.

They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of
them are too drunk to be scared.

                      JACK
           Where is your captain? Ou est votre
           capitaine?

One man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of
others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and
Spanish.

298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

It's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down
their colours.

A cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY
and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured
flag.

A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre.
BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow.

299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON

A doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody
apron, red-eyed from fatigue.

JACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair
and blood-stained cutlass.

                     JACK
           Le Capitaine? Where is he?

The doctor points at a body on the operating table.

JACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ]
somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black
coat draped over his body.
                     DOCTOR
           Il mávait prie de vous donner ceci.

Passing JACK the captain's sword.

300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

JACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where
CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY.

                     CALAMY
           He's dead, sir.

Gently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back
down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms.

Friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses
the gangway to...

301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

...then with CALAMY following, he goes below.

302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under
the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained
eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix
of grief and depression, the old question, "Was it worth the
price?".

                                                 FADE TO BLACK

                                                 FADE UP ON -

303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN

The two ships anchored close together on the ocean.

304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN

As eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row
of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen
crewman.

DAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks,
BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach -

                     CALAMY
           I'll do it.
JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him
alone.

As CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard
distinctly from below.

                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble
          up! Tumble up!

In close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY

                    HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Sleepers awake!

...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed.

305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN

The small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck.
JACK's voice drifting across the water.

                    JACK
          John Henry ALLEN...
          Joseph NAGEL...
          William Horner...
          Stephen Winston Boyle...
          and Lieutenant William Blakeney

          We therefore commit their bodies to the
          deep, looking for the resurrection of the
          body, when the sea shall give up her
          dead...
          Amen.

                    ALL
          Amen.

The bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea.

306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two
dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various
features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to
take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend.

307.   THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON - DAY

The two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts
jury-rigged.

308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY

JACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals
midshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron.

                    JACK
          Signal... 'Parole prisoners
          Valparaiso'...

                    WILLIAMSON
          You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir?

                    JACK
          No. Captain Pullings.

WILLIAMSON hurries to the signals locker, the signal book and
JACK's message in his hand.

309.   TELESCOPE POV   DAY

The line of colored signal-flags run up to the mast-head of
the Surprise.

309A   QUARTERDECK ACHERON

Midshipman Rye is reading the signal for Pullings

                    RYE
          ....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God-
          speed, Captain Pullings.'

A contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is
confirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a
sharp turn away from the Surprise.

311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK

Slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and
routines reassert themselves.

· Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck
composing a poem in memory of the battle.

· JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to
a small attentive audience.

· While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about
BECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way
around most of his torso.

· BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures
collected at the Galapagos, as...

· BONDEN reads his first book, 'Diseases of Seamen' by
Stephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently.

· While the powder-monkeys skylark in the rigging

313.   INTERIOR, GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN plays a note on his cello [      ]

                    STEPHEN
          Shall we begin?

JACK pauses, gazing into space.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Jack, brother, you're gathering wool.

                    JACK (smiles)
          Thinking about their captain. A great
          seaman, whatever you may say of him. The
          doctor said he was killed by our first
          broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him,
          face to face.

                    STEPHEN
          Maybe you did.

                      JACK
          What?

                    STEPHEN
          While I was tending the prisoners they
          told me their doctor died of fever, two
          weeks ago. There was no doctor on that
          ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you
          will find one there now.

JACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of
water flowing gently past the hull.

He looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the
thought of a possible final deception flooding through him.

                      STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Shall we?
He starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello
carrying through to ....

312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is
preparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL.

                     KILLICK
           That's the last of the cheese and like as
           not they'll leave it seizing to their
           plates with their tweedly tweedly
           tweedly.

                     JACK (O.S.)
           Killick? KILLICK THERE!

                     KILLICK (projecting)
           Which it will be ready when it's ready!

In the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling,
undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through
the great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far
away. Jack breaks off abruptly:

                      JACK

          You're still missing your cormorant...
          flightless eh...well then. It will still
          be there when we come back

And he breaks into a merry jig

313.   SURPRISE, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

Wide, to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding
water lit by the great stern lantern. Through the casement
windows the two men can be seen playing.

Wider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around,
with the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly
visible in the darkness.

314.   FURTHER BACK

And further still. Until we see the curve of the earth, and
the planet spinning on its journey through space.

     AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR

     INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT

     We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American
     in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a
     corner, staring at a television screen.

     The television shows a surveillance view of the living room
     that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image
     is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get
     comfortable but he's been there a while

     ON THE SCREEN

     A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel
     room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits
     in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-
     shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the
     room behind him.  A legend:

                          KIEV

     KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,
     ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian
     godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY
     looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit
     by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is
     bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian
     which is subtitled.

                          ANATOLY
                Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called
                us.

                          KASIMOV
                     (sobbing)
                I don't remember what happened!  We were
                at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having
                fun.

     ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the
     room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an
     unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared
     with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.

                          KASIMOV
                I don't even know how I got here.
                I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I
                didn't lay a finger on her.

     ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.

                          ANATOLY
                Kasimov.  Don't flounder.

     IN THE CLOSET

     JACK, impatient, checks his watch. 

                          JACK 
                Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come 
                on, come on! 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          KASIMOV 
                You're the only one who can help me. 

     Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits 
     his hand away and smacks him around the head. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     JACK reacts. 

     ON THE SCREEN

     ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY 
                C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 

                          KASIMOV 
                They'll kill me. 

     ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY 
                You asked for my help.  You asked for my
                help...come on... 

                          KASIMOV
                You're right, of course. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     JACK leans forward. 

                          JACK 
                The name pal...give us the name. 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          KASIMOV 
                The contact in Minsk..the contact in 
                Minsk..works in a travel agency. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

                          JACK 
                Come on! 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          ANATOLY 
                Come on! 

                          KASIMOV 
                His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. 

                          ANATOLY 
                Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... 

     IN THE CLOSET 

                          JACK 
                Got him. 

     ON THE SCREEN 

     Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder
     as if he had just anointed him. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross 
     checks -- "MIEDIEV" comes up, then "posting/American 
     consulate/Kiev." 

     JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in 
     the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic 
     and virtually no bottom.  She quickly leaves. 

     INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT

     We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. 
     She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot 
     glasses. 

                          ANATOLY 
                Now, we drink. 

     He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY (CONT'D) 
                To friends. 

                          KASIMOV 
                Yes, Anatoly, yes. 

                          JACK 
                Cheers. 

     He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. 
     Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY 
     moves to the closet door and opens it. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     ANATOLY reaches up to his face --

     --and tears away a mask of flesh.  He's no middle aged 
     Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early 
     thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands 
     ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the 
     room. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (in English now) 
                Get rid of this scum. 

     Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO 
     OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. 

     ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks 
     the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He 
     strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the 
     dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a 
     stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. 

     CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half 
     rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her 
     mouth. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Did we get it? 

                          ETHAN 
                We got it.  On your feet. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. 

                          ETHAN 
                Walk, just walk.  Start walking. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm walking. 

                          ETHAN 
                Talking's good, walking's better. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Sleeping's better. 

     Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling 
     lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to 
     come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set 
     in the middle of an empty warehouse. 

     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him 
     questioningly. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Are you all right Ethan.  What's wrong
                with you? 

                          ETHAN 
                If you're gonna do this again Claire, 
                It's not gonna be on my watch. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Oh yeah? 

     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, 
     questioningly. 

                          JACK 
                Claire. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack. 

     She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her 
     finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at 
     large. 

                          ETHAN
                IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT 
                OUT OF HERE YET?! 

                          JACK 
                Just waiting for you, tubs. 

     He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, 
     clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding 
     ring. 

     We move in on it --

                                                            CUT TO: 

     INT. JET - DAY

     -- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's 
     finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the 
     plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves 
     some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a 
     fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. 

     The pilot's voice makes an announcement. 

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off 
                at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight 
                thousand feet-and we should be arriving 
                in Prague right on schedule. 

     A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing 
     out menus. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 

     A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                          (CONT'D) 
                Would you like to watch a movie Mr 
                Phelps? 

     The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his 
     mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and 
     not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the 
     ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. 

                          PHELPS 
                No, I prefer the theatre.  

     A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes 
     stilted. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you consider the cinema of the
                Ukraine? 

                          PHELPS 
                Perhaps you'd choose one for me. 

     The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes 
     a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the 
     armrest. 

     AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.

     The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 
     cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of 
     the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. 

     BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT

     The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. 
     He takes it without a word and she moves on. 

     PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between 
     his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small 
     movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the 
     other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the 
     armrest, and puts the tape in. 

     He presses play.

     ON THE TAPE, 

     the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, 
     but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed 
     glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than 
     tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever 
     look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (on the tape) 
                Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're 
                about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 

     The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man 
     in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, 
     presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks 
     down a foreign street. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                -- a former KGB Line X officer now 
                working the international black market 
                selling intelligence.  This morning, we 
                learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half 
                of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- 
                official cover agents working in Eastern 
                Europe. 

     The screen shows an image of what such a list might look 
     like, code names and other information scrolling by on a 
     computer screen at high speed. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                For security reasons, the NOC list is 
                divided into two encoded halves. 
                Golitsyn already has the cryptonym 
                portion, which contains agent code names 
                and targeting areas.  This portion is 
                useless unless combined with the second 
                half -- the true name list that is kept 
                in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 

     The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building 
     at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava 
     River. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the 
                true name list at an Embassy function 
                tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you 
                decide to accept it, is to obtain 
                photographic proof of the theft, apprehend 
                those involved, and return the stolen 
                list.  I don't have to stress the 
                importance of this matter, Jim.  We're 
                keeping it internally black. Because of  
                its urgency, I've already sent to Prague 
                a team selected from your usual group. 

     Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already 
     seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                Ethan Hunt will of course be your point 
                man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're 
                getting word to him now. 

     INT. JET - DAY

     PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his 
     tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                As always, should you or any member of 
                your IM force be caught or killed, the 
                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.  This tape will self- 
                destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, 
                Jim! 

     PHELPS inhales deeply -- 

     -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a 
     plume of wispy smoke -- 

     -- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of 
     cigarette smoke. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY

     SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. 
     Another legend: 

                         PRAGUE 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY 

     The IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague 
     apartment with a panoramic view of the city. 

     The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, 
     overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. 
     JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating 
     the VISCO glasses to her.  CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at 
     the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH 
     taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. 

                          JACK 
                Look to your right, then back to me. 
                There's a camera built right into the 
                bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and 
                transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

                          SARAH 
                Of course I can hear you. 

                          JACK 
                No, in your...ear piece. You have a 
                lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me 
                now? 

                          SARAH 
                Loud and clear. 

                          JACK 
                What's going on? 

                          SARAH 
                I don't know. 

                          JACK 
                Why don't you take a look? 

                          SARAH 
                Jack...that's spying. 

                          JACK 
                That's what we do isn't it? 

                          SARAH 
                Jack you're so wicked. 

                          JACK 
                Too wicked to have a drink later? 

                          SARAH 
                I think I might just take that look. 

     ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more 
                than ninety days leave coming. 

                          PHELPS 
                A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. 
                Take it all, if you want.  After this one. 

                          ETHAN 
                I thought I'd take some now. 

                          PHELPS
                     (quietly, to Ethan) 
                What the hell's made you decide to take 
                your leave at the worst possible time? 
                Claire's in a weird mood too. 

                          ETHAN 
                Oh?  What's the problem? 

                          PHELPS 
                I don't know, I had to go to Chicago 
                again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me. 

                          ETHAN 
                Tell you what? 

                          PHELPS 
                When you started noticing your short term 
                memory loss.  What the problem was you 
                and Claire had in Kiev? 

                          ETHAN 
                What problem? 

                          PHELPS
                     (laughs)
                Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking
                burnout here?

                          ETHAN 
                I guess. 

                          PHELPS 
                Ethan, you can't burn out. 

                          ETHAN
                Why not? 

                          PHELPS 
                Because I can't afford it. And because 
                you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

     CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to 
     be the reference point in the following exchange: 

                          ETHAN 
                How was Chicago? 

                          PHELPS 
                Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto 
                dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the 
                one about the astronaut who comes back 
                from the first manned flight to Mars 
                after two years?  His wife's got a year 
                old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was 
                it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,
                it was my friend Sammy."  She says it 
                wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my 
                friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, 
                don't you think I have any friends of my 
                own?!" 

     PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is 
     in his line of sight. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                Boy, you really are grim. Come here, 
                take a look. 

     He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. 

     EXT. PRAGUE - DAY 

     ETHAN's POV of Embassy. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

     ETHAN nods. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                Beyond Charles Bridge there is our 
                Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if 
                anything goes wrong, this guy will steal 
                the names of our agents in every country 
                all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to 
                the highest bidders -- third world 
                terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 
                any and everybody who'd love to get rid 
                of long term coverts like us, and some 
                very dear friends among them.  If they're 
                exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over 
                here.  Take a lock at this. 

     CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a 
     quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old 
     edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is 
     playing. 

     ETHAN is distracted by it. 

     INSERT - TELEVISION

     SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, 
     is holding forth: 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA 
                and all its shadow organizations have 
                become irrelevant at best and 
                unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we 
                throw a little light on the whole concept 
                of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These 
                covert agency subgroups have confidential 
                funding, they report to no one -- who are
                these people?!  We were living in a 
                democracy the last time I checked. 

     BACK TO SCENE 

     ETHAN looks back at JIM. 

                          ETHAN 
                You're going to use Walter? 

                          PHELPS 
                He's our guy. 

                          ETHAN 
                Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 

                          PHELPS 
                Not this week. This week he's flyfishing 
                at the Oughterard Slough in County 
                Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 

                          ETHAN
                He won't be back in a hurry? 

                          PHELPS 
                No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? 
                You think the plot'll work? 

                          ETHAN 
                Sure.  If the main character does. 

                          PHELPS 
                If you were me, Ethan, who would you
                trust to make him believable? 

     JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum.

                          JACK 
                Sorry, am I interrupting?  

                          ETHAN
                Always. 

     JACK shows the gum to ETHAN.

                          JACK 
                Stick of gum. If you come up against a 
                lock you can't pick -- 

     Half the gum is red, the other half is green. 

                          JACK (CONT'D) 
                Red light.  Green light.  Mash them 
                together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on 
                you -- you have five seconds. 

     He offers the gum to ETHAN.

                          PHELPS 
                Are you gonna take it? 

     CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. 
     PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (relenting) 
                Give me the God damn gum. 

                          JACK 
                Just don't chew it. 

                          PHELPS 
                Thank you. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

     The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party 
     at the Embassy tonight. 

     INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking 
     eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator 
     shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks 
     up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's 
     looking for -- 

     -- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching 
     the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The 
     monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside 
     of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of 
     the elevator shaft. 

     PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. 

                          PHELPS 
                Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by 
                twenty-three hundred. 

     INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair 
     that's in full swing on the second floor. 

     SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand 
     staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo 
     hurries up to him. 

                          DIPLOMAT 
                How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, 
                the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just 
                steer you through the reception line here
                --

     The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a 
     reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. 

                          DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) 
                Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the 
                director of the National Gallery -- Petr 
                Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- 

     SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant 
     gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with 
     WALTZER. 

                          SARAH 
                I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                Of course I do.  How are you, Miss 
                Norman? 

     He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so 
     SARAH whispers something in his ear. 

                          SARAH 
                He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 

     Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 

     The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket 
     (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this 
     confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. 

     UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, 

     ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from 
     outside. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through 
     the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks 
     into his microphone. 

                          PHELPS 
                Sarah, mark the package and go to two. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

     SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. 

                          SARAH 
                Your advance team mentioned you'd want a 
                tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead 
                and set that up for you -- 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                Terrific.  Let's get going. 
                     (to the Diplomat) 
                Will you excuse us?  

     He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the 
     party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads 
     further into the Embassy. 

                          DIPLOMAT 
                Uh, sir? 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT                               

     JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal 
     box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a 
     noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above 
     him descending. 

     JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The 
     elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him 
     to the wall. 

                          JACK 
                Great.  Come on. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 

     As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, 
     SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as 
     she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing 
     herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never 
     notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT     

     JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks 
     to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy 
     one, as someone hurrying up stairs. 

                          PHELPS 
                Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

     On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and 
     slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. 

                          HANNAH 
                En route. 

     She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the 
     party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her 
     glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the 
     lenses. 

                          PHELPS (O/S) 
                Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to
                night vision). 

     HANNAHíS VISCO POV 

     the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands 
     out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green 
     where SARAH sprayed it. 

     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

     The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down 
     the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- 
     Political Attaches Only."  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. 

     He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an 
     elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it 
     says "Out of Order."  They head for it anyway. 

     A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them 
     by surprise.  

                          JACK 
                Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. 

                          GUARD 
                Excuse me, can I help you? 

                          SARAH 
                -- which leads directly to the Denied 
                Area, the only limited access area in the 
                whole facility. 

     SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. 

                          SARAH (CONT'D) 
                As you can see. this area has both a 
                Marine guard and video surveillance, and 
                is strictly monitored at all times. 

     She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank 
     and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes 
     a message -- "ACCESS DENIED."  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. 

                          SARAH (CONT'D)
                     (covering) 
                Senator, don't you have a young man on 
                your staff named JACK? 

     She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack?  I believe we did have a young man 
                named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I 
                recall.  Constantly late or behind in his 
                work. 

     Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed 
     access, comes closer to them. 

                          GUARD 
                Excuse me, let me see that ID again! 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening 
     to their conversation. 

                          PHELPS (O.S.) 
                Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a 
                second.  Keep dancing.  

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                     (with the Senator's southern accent) 
                We were forced to tie him to my best 
                stallion and drag him around the barn a 
                few times.  

     Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. 

                          JACK 
                Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on
                it. 

     He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of 
     circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the 
     elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.

     THE LAPTOP

     there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID 
     picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. 

     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

     Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the 
     thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time 
     the message flashes -- 

                          IDENTITY CONFIRMED 

     -- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  

     The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR. 

                          GUARD 
                Oh. Sorry, sir. 

     He snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and 
     the doors close behind them. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     JACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he 
     can see them inside. 

                          JACK 
                The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely
                off. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's 
     view of the party on his video monitors. 

                          PHELPS 
                     (a touch of impatience) 
                Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

     HANNAH, stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves 
     to get a better view of the party. She reacquires GOLITSYN's 
     glowing head.  

                          HANNAH 
                He's heading to the denied area. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     This work room is filled with combination lock filing 
     cabinets and various computer terminals.  ETHAN hands SARAH 
     his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them 
     upside down on top of a filing cabinet.  

     ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, 
     switching several times. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to Sarah) 
                Higher.  Higher.  

                          SARAH 
                Higher. 

                          ETHAN 
                Right, right.  Good. 

     SARAH adjusts the glasses. 

     THROUGH THE GLASSES, 

     the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but 
     clear.  Anyone sitting there will be recorded. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     On PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on 
     the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer.  PHELPS 
     barks out a warning.  

                          PHELPS 
                Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     ETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already 
     moving up. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack we're in position. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall 
     simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the 
     rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are 
     waiting for it to arrive. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack.  Jack. 

                          JACK 
                I didn't touch it. 

     The elevator stops, the doors open -- 

     -- and GOLITSYN gets on.  GOLITSYN descends in the elevator 
     with JACK on top and ETHAN and SARAH waiting down below! 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with 
     GOLITSYN inside.  

                          PHELPS 
                     (tension rising) 
                He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one 
     GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a 
     place to hide. 

                          ETHAN 
                OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open
                the doors. 

                          SARAH 
                What about my coat?  I'll freeze. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                I don't have it. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

     PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. 

                          PHELPS 
                Opening the doors.  Go under. 

     He jabs ENTER on his keyboard. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft 
     beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space 
     below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator 
     continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator 
     drops to just over their heads and stops. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides 
     a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. 
     Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, 
     downloading the vital information. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, 
     starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as 
     GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a 
     microphone.  

                          ETHAN 
                He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                Give me a break, Pops. 

                          SARAH 
                Such a nice ass. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                And a lonely ass. 

                          ETHAN 
                Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport 
                in five minutes. 

                          CLAIRE (O.S.) 
                Roger that. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now 
     reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base 
     of the elevator shaft. 

     EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the 
     final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes 
     and SPARKS. 

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the 
     waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous 
     couple. 

                          ETHAN
                In position.  Jack open the door, let the
                package roll.

                          JACK (O.S.)
                Roger that.  Opening doors now.

                          ETHAN
                Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to
                transport.

     ETHANíS voice comes over HANNAHíS earpiece.

                          HANNAH
                En route.

     HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     The button marked "ROOF" lights up, seemingly all by itself.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     The car engages with a sharp jolt --

                          JACK
                Hey.

     --and starts to rise.  JACK looks down, into the elevator
     car, through the grate.  Thereís no one in it.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     On one of his monitors, PHELPS sees the elevator moving in
     the shaft.

                          PHELPS
                Jack, what are you doing?!

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

                          JACK
                Iím not doing anything!  (I donít have it
                either).

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button
     but gets no response.

                          PHELPS
                I donít have it -- I donít have
                control!

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     JACKíS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the
     approaching ceiling.

                          JACK
                Uh -- then I have a problem.

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     GOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer,
     slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     JACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching
     roof, covered with spikes.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACKíS P.O.V. of the roof of
     the building approaching.  Fast.

                          ETHAN
                Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do
                you hear me.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control
     panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get
     the thing to stop.

     He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster.
     He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him.
        
                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                Come on, Jack, come on.

     JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his
     hands, he SCREAMS --

     --and heís crushed to death against the roof.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was
     JACKíS signal.

                          ETHAN
                Jack.  Jack.

     He closes his eyes, knowing what that means.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS also sees the static.

                          PHELPS
                Man down.  Stay where you are.  Iím on my
                way.

     He gets up and races out of the apartment.

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     GOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the
     elevator button but it wonít even light up.  He studies the
     elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and
     SARAH did moments before.

     He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small
     door at the shaftís base.

     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS hurries towards the bridge.

                          PHELPS
                En route.

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

     PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the
     river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his
     shoulder.  Paranoiaís setting in.

     EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT

     Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the
     service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in
     the midst of a loverís quarrel, in Russian.

     Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is
     still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if
     hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening
     gloom.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPíS voice over the monitor.

                          SARAH
                The package is in the open.

                          ETHAN
                Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Iíve got a shadow.

                          ETHAN
                Can you lose him?

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                No.  Abort.

     Over ETHANís shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.  Fog
     starts to roll over the river towards the bridge.

                          SARAH
                Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.                

                          ETHAN
                     (to Phelps) 
                Jim we canít.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Abort.  Thatís an order.

                          ETHAN
                Negative, Golitsynís on the move.

     INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT

     Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN
     argue.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue.

                          ETHAN
                Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím
                coming to you.

                          SARAH
                Jim gave an abort, we should walk
                away.

                          ETHAN
                No, weíre going to recover the disk,
                understand?!  Now move!

     ETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow
     GOLITSYN.

     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

     HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle.

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Where are you?

                          ETHAN
                About two hundred yards from the bridge.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan.
                Cut all radio communications.  Repeat.
                Cut all radio communications.  

     ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past
     CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor
     and again sees PHELPSí POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is
     looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

     SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where
     a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears
     into the fog at the edge of the river.

     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

     ETHAN checks his monitor again.

     THE MONITOR

     PHELPSí point of view changes radically as his head swivels
     on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his
     shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,
     pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a
     GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.

     The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down
     to a bloody hole in his own chest.

     His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge
     and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.
        
     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

     ETHANís face goes white with shock.

                          ETHAN
                JIM!

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

     He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereís
     no sign of PHELPS.

     ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but
     sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming
     obscured in the gathering fog.

     He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see
     GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.

     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

     ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point
     on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIREíS outline,
     visible in the driverís seat.  But as he descends the stairs
     --

     --the car explodes and bursts into flames.

     The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.

                          ETHAN
                CLAIRE!

     He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a 
     stunned CROWD starts to gather.

     Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the
     embankment.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

     SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
     GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an
     seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.

     SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to
     be hanging with her for some reason.

     EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT

     ETHAN continues towards the embankment.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

     SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of
     GOLITSYN pulls him towards him.  Sensing something wrong,
     SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over
     GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYNís
     pockets.

     The figure finds what itís looking for -- the disk -- and
     takes it.  SARAH comes closer --

     -- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,
     plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.

     ANGLE

     ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts
     out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,
     over GOLITSYNís body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and
     GASPS.

     He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He
     looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated
     edge.

     BEHIND ETHAN

     The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, theyíre
     watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him
     leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.

     AT THE BODIES

     SARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body
     over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins
     rummaging through his pockets.

     ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...

     ANGLE

     A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in
     front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop
     suddenly.

     As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the
     explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley
     and out of sight.

     EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

     ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  Heís
     holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a 
     modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts
     of the phoneís wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.

     He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneís tongue
     down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial
     tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
     heart.

     After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Satcom seven.

                          ETHAN
                Central Europe.  Unsecured.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Designator?

                          ETHAN
                Bravo Echo one one.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Switching.

     There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the
     line.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                This is Kittridge.

                          ETHAN
                Go secure.

     Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.      
        
                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Go ahead.

                          ETHAN
                Theyíre dead.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Whoís dead?

                          ETHAN
                My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -
                - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
        
                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Are you damaged?

                          ETHAN
                They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís
                dead too.  The disk is gone.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Are you intact?

                          ETHAN
                Do you read me?  The list is in the open!

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Let's just bring you in safely, and then
                we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you
                followed?

     ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGEíS voice is strong and
     reassuring and he needs that right now.

                          ETHAN
                I donít think so.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Donít think, be sure.  Are you clean?

                          ETHAN
                Yes.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there
                myself.

                          ETHAN
                Youíre in Prague?

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít
                disappoint me.

                          ETHAN
                No sir.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                One hour.

     He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone
     for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the
     street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every
     sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his
     hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.

     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

     ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,
     gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by 
     residential buildings.

     ETHANíS POV

     Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built
     on the portico of an old palace.

     Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively
     shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.

     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     ETHAN'S POV 

     ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an 
     enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. 
     He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are 
     scattered around. 

     EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and 
     ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple 
     of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he 
     goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized 
     lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit. 
                          
                          KITTRIDGE 
                I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know 
                how much Jim in particular meant to you, 
                Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah. 

     He spots a stack of documents on the table.

     ETHAN picks them up.  There's a Canadian picture bearing 
     ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, 
     driver's license, etc. 

                          KITTRIDGE
                Passport, visas - you know the drill. 
                We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, 
                debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague 
                police a bone, you know toss them a few 
                suspects.  Follow me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah.  I follow you. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                We've lost enough agents for one night. 

                          ETHAN 
                You mean I've lost enough agents for one 
                night. 

     KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, 
     carefully: 
        
                          KITTRIDGE 
                You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 
                Ethan. 

                          ETHAN 
                Who else is left? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Yes.  I see your point. 

                          ETHAN 
                Why was there another team? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                What? 

                          ETHAN 
                Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I don't quite follow you. 

                          ETHAN
                Let's see if you can follow me around 
                this room. 
                     (eyes moving around the room) 
                The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 
                and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing 
                around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. 
                The waiter behind Hannah at the top of 
                the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The 
                other IMF team.  You're worried about me. 
                Why?

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (a tight little smile) 
                You're right.  Maybe this'll save some 
                time. 

     The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE 
     tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out 
     of his jacket. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                For a little over two years now we've 
                been spotting serious blowback in IMF 
                operations.  We have a penetration.  The 
                other day we decoded a message on the 
                Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

                          ETHAN 
                The arms dealer. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                That's right.  Max, it seems, has two 
                unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
                and for corrupting susceptible agents. 
                This time he's gotten to someone on the 
                inside - he's put himself in a position 
                to buy our NOC list. An operation he 
                referred to as "Job 314".  The job he 
                thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. 

                          ETHAN 
                But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Correct the actual list is safe at 
                Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 
                one of ours. 

                          ETHAN 
                This whole operation was a molehunt. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like 
                you said.  You survived. 

     ETHAN stares at him levelly. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)
                I want to show you something, Ethan. 

     He now shoves the papers across the table.  They're xeroxed 
     copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and 
     MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                Since your father's death, your family's 
                farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, 
                suddenly, they're flush with over a 
                hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 
                Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 
                out the bank account -- dying slowly in 
                America after all, can be a very 
                expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why 
                don't we go quietly out of here onto the 
                plane... 

                          ETHAN 
                How about if we just go quietly into the 
                bathroom and I wash your mouth out with 
                soap - you pathetic button down 
                bureaucratic asshole. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                Ethan, I can understand you're very 
                upset. 

                          ETHAN 
                Kitteridge, you've never seen me very 
                upset. 

        ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While 
        KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've 
                bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 
                intimate loyalties to get away with it. 
                You're determined to shake hands with the 
                devil and I'm going to make sure you do 
                it in hell. 

     We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of 
     bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, 
     mushing the two sides together. 

     ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the
     table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of 
     gum. 

     Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine 
     glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- 

     -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes 
     widen.  KA BOOM! 

     The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish 
     tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and 
     WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. 

     At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. 

     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

     ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the 
     deserted square. 

     EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

     Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs 
     illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, 
     then puts his jacket back on. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and 
     scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the 
     next bulb. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT

     At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft 
     sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments 
     dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

     In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with 
     flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a 
     Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking 
     them as he goes. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

     ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, 
     pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He 
     unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various 
     denominations from various countries and a couple of 
     passports. 

     As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the
     mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water 
     and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he 
     notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the 
     static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by 
     one, he switches them off. 

     THE LAPTOP 

     JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN 
     wakes it up. 
        
     The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its 
     connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: 

                SELECT USENET GROUP

     ETHAN TYPES IN

                          ETHAN
                Job.  Job 3:14.  March fourteen.  Job 31 
                March. 

     The computer replies: 

                SEARCHING STRING NOT FOUND

     ETHAN tries again: 

                max.com

     The answer: 

                SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND

     He tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," 
     but nothing comes up.  He tries something else -- "scroll 
     usenet groups."  

     The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying 
     speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. 

     ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to 
     figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the 
     others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES. 

                          ETHAN 
                Job three fourteen.  Job --
                     (a realization, 
                     the Biblical pronunciation) 
                It's Job! 

     He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and 
     finds a Gideon Bible.  He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the 
     Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors..." 

     He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the 
     Internet and under the command "Select Usenet Group" he 
     types: 

                BIBLE

     The computer replies:

 GROUP. WHICH CHAPTER AND VERSE DO                 YOU WISH TO POST YOUR ENTRY UNDER?

     ETHAN types his answer "Job 3:14" and the screen presents a 
     "stickie" for him to write his message on.  He does: 

                          ETHAN

     ANGLE

     A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other 
     side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, 
     his middle a hopelessly bloody mess.  He looks like he's 
     dying on his feet.  ETHAN freezes, appalled. 

                          PHELPS
                Ethan, what are you doing? 

     ETHAN tries to speak but nothing will come out. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the 
                bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan? 
                Ethan? 

     ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. 
     PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from 
     the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked 
     and pointed at -- 

     ANGLE

     It's CLAIRE. 

                          ETHAN 
                What are you doing here?! 

     CLAIRE freezes, her hands half-raised. 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (carefully) 
                Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. 
                Ethan what's wrong with you? 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't move. 

     Her right hand has moved a fraction.  She freezes again. 

                          ETHAN 
                You were in the car! 

                          CLAIRE 
                I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in 
                trouble on the radio.  He said someone 
                was... 

                          ETHAN 
                Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the 
                car. 

                          CLAIRE 
                No, I got out of the car and I ran to the
                bridge. 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What happened to Jim? 

                          ETHAN 
                There was nobody on the bridge. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What happened to Jim? 

     Ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. 

                          ETHAN 
                Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire! 
                Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all 
                dead! 

     ETHAN releases her wrists. 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (mumbling) 
                They're dead.  Jim's dead. 

                          ETHAN
                Take off your coat. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What? 

                          ETHAN 
                Take off your God damn coat! 

     He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- 
     spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead 
     body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. 

     CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand 
     cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S 
     shivering. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                Where were you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                I walked away.  He said abort.  He was 
                gone so I walked away. 

                          ETHAN 
                That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? 
                Did they send you here? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (slowly) 
                Who is "they?" 

                          ETHAN 
                Did they send you...Did they send you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Who is they, who is they? 

        ETHAN grabs her by the wrists. 

                          ETHAN 
                Who sent you?!  Who sent you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (screaming) 
                No one sent me!  We're supposed to be 
                back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, 
                if we abort, we don't return here until 
                four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, 
                four o'clock --! 

     She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, 
     BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN 
     releases his grip on her wrists. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

     ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, 
     still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of 
     the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Why haven't they brought us in yet? 

                          ETHAN
                I've been disavowed.  They think I killed 
                Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred 
                thousand dollars found its way into my 
                parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes 
                I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've 
                been in the employ of an arms dealer, 
                Max, for the last two years, to get him 
                our NOC list. 

     A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What are you going to do? 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the 
                mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, 
                at least part of the time. 1 can't find 
                him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, 
                he'll find me. 
                
                          CLAIRE 
                Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me 
                go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going 
                to tell him you had nothing to do... 

                          ETHAN
                Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not 
                dead, he's going to assume you're with 
                me. 

     The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. 

     THE COMPUTER SCREEN

     Blinking -- "MESSAGE WAITING."  ETHAN hurries over and clicks 
     on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows 
     up: 

     ?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. 

 ? BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL 
 ? AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS 
     ?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH

     CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. 

                          CLAIRE 
                The message is for Job. 

                          ETHAN
                I'm going to answer it. 

     EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY

     ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A 
     MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to 
     ETHAN. 

                          ETHAN 
                Excuse me, could I trouble you for a 
                match? 

     Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As 
     ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm 
     and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. 

     INT. CAR - DAY

     ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. 
     MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He 
     extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. 

                          MATTHIAS
                Would you remove your hat please? 

                          ETHAN 
                Why? 

                          MATTHIAS 
                You wish to meet Max?  This is the price 
                of admission. 

     Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car 
     takes off. 

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting 
     upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in 
     the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are 
     drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- 
     expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 

     Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few 
     seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone 
     is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. 

                          ETHAN
                I thought I was going to see Max. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. 

                          ETHAN 
                Then what am I doing here? 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Allowing Max to see you and hear what 
                you've got to say. 

                          ETHAN 
                I don't communicate very well through a 
                shroud. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                If Max doesn't like what you have to say, 
                you'll be wearing that shroud 
                indefinitely. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm willing to take the chance. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Very well. 

     MAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. 
     When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall 
     woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of 
     severity. 

                          MAX 
                Who are you and what are you doing here? 
                          
                          ETHAN 
                I need one hundred thousand dollars. 

                          MAX
                Really?  And you thought if you simply 
                showed up I might give it to you? 

                          ETHAN 
                Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and 
                twenty five thousand. 

                          MAX 
                The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, 
                Job is not given to quoting Scripture in 
                his communications. And there was its 
                tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is 
                not playful.  So you're something of a 
                paradox. 

                          ETHAN 
                That depends. 

                          MAX
                On what? 

                          ETHAN 
                Whether you like a paradox.  I want a 
                hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

                          MAX
                It's quite out of the question. 

                          ETHAN 
                The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's 
                bait, part of an internal molehunt. 

                          MAX
                And how might you know that?  Are you 
                another Company man? 

                          ETHAN 
                Like Job? 

                          MAX 
                Ah, but, we're asking about you. 

                          ETHAN
                I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. 

                          MAX 
                Why, may I ask? 

                          ETHAN
                That's the question I want to ask Job. 

                          MAX 
                I don't know Job any more than he knows 
                me. 

                          ETHAN 
                Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an 
                introduction. 

                          MAX 
                Why should I? 

                          ETHAN 
                Because I can deliver the actual NOC 
                list.  The one you have is not only 
                worthless, it's certain to be equipped 
                with a homing device to pinpoint your 
                exact location. 

                          MAX 
                It's easy to say the disk is worthless 
                when you say I can't look at the 
                information and see if it's worthless. 
                Not a tenable position, sir. 

                          ETHAN 
                Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from 
                thirty seconds to ten minutes you're 
                gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping 
                around you like jackrabbits. 

                          MAX 
                     (Pause.) 
                Mm - Hmmm... 

                          ETHAN
                Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner 
                you used in the car? 

                          MAX 
                Very good. 

                          ETHAN 
                Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up 
                first. 

     ANGLE

     MATTHIAS boots up.  There's a little musical noise and the 
     screen brightens.  The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a 
     complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other 
     personal information scrolls by.  But Matthias is watching 
     the digital read-out on the RF scanner. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so 
                good. 

                          MAX 
                That's not so good for you, my friend. 

     On the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Thirty-two and change. 

                          MAX 
                     (to Ethan) 
                Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just 
                be the hard drive heating up. 

     She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to 
     make up her mind about something. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Forty-four.  Forty-five. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'd say you've got about two minutes. 

     MAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows -- 

     --nothing happens. He opens the French doors that lead out 
     onto a balcony. 

     EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY

     The OTHER MAN comes out on the balcony.  Nothing out here but 
     a beautiful day.  He walks to the railing and looks down at 
     the street. 

     Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street 
     sign.  WOOF.  WOOF.  WOOF.  Abruptly, it stops. 

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 

     Back inside: 

                          MATTHIAS
                Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. 

     EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT

     A pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street 
     activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi 
     as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the 
     van. 

     INT. MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

     Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined 
     trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit 
     the stairs. They climb them silently. 

     INT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

     A CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the 
     AGENTS come up the stairs, guns drawn. Her jaw drops and she 
     turns off the vacuum cleaner. 

                          FEMALE IMF 
                     (in czech) 
                Switch it on.  Keep cleaning. 

     KITTRIDGE looks at her sharply and gestures.  She turns the 
     vacuum back on. They reach the door of a certain apartment 
     and -- 

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     -- KICK through it.  The AGENTS swarm into MAX'S apartment, 
     guns waving in all directions.  KITTRIDGE sweeps in between 
     them and takes command of the place -- 

     --but there's nobody here.  TWO AGENTS race into the bedroom, 
     and just as quickly out again. 

     EXT. POWDER TOWER - TOP SHOT - DAY

     MAX, ETHAN, MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN move quickly across 
     the bridge that connects Max's apartment to the tower. 

     EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT BALCONY - DAY

     KITTRIDGE kicks open the door to the balcony, comes outside, 
     and looks around.  Nobody in sight. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                GOD D- 

     INT. MAX'S CAR - ETHAN AND MAX - DAY 

                          MAX 
                Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use 
                one of his apartments again. 
                     (turns to Ethan) 
                Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. 
                You're a good sport.  Do accept the 
                compliment. 

                          ETHAN 
                Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine? 

     INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY 

                          MAX
                I don't have to tell you what a comfort 
                anonymity can be in my profession -- like 
                a warm blanket. 
                     (abruptly) 
                My deal with Job was subject to a 
                successful boot scan.  Obviously it 
                didn't pass muster.  Deal's off. 

                          ETHAN 
                What was your deal with Job? 

                          MAX 
                Six million dollars.  I'll give you the 
                same.  But I want the complete list now, 
                not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this 
                piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want 
                the entire list, the true name of every 
                non-official cover agent throughout the 
                world. 

                          ETHAN 
                Ten million.  Ten million in negotiable 
                U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer 
                form, coupons attached.  And one more 
                thing -- your personal assurance that Job 
                will be at the exchange. 

                          MAX 
                Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want 
                it by the end of the week. 

                          ETHAN
                How will you make sure Job will be there? 

                          MAX
                How will you make sure I'll have the list 
                in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now 
                where can I drop you dear boy? 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm not being dropped anywhere without my 
                money. 

     MAX manages to laugh without coughing.  Then, with an 
     admonishing forefinger: 

                          MAX 
                I'm going to have to front you 
                personally.  Don't lose that money 
                without losing your life. 

                          ETHAN 
                I wouldn't dream of it. 

     MAX settles back and regards ETHAN.  A theatrical sigh.  She 
     fancies this guy.

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

     KITTRIDGE waits on the balcony for his AGENTS to complete 
     their search.  HARRY BARNES, a middle-aged, gray suited, 
     somewhat gray-faced bureaucrat, comes to join Kittridge. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under 
                until he decides to surface. 

                          BARNES 
                Look we can use someone from the Embassy 
                and we can get the local authorities 
                involved. Close off his transportation. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the 
                airport?  How many identities do you 
                think Hunt has?  How many times has he 
                slipped past custom, in how many 
                countries?  These guys are trained to be 
                ghosts.  We taught them how to do it, for 
                Christ's sake! 

                          BARNES 
                So what do you suggest? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make 
                him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure 
                points.  Find out something that's 
                important to him personally and you 
                squeeze.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

     ETHAN enters the living room.  CLAIRE walks out of the 
     bedroom holding a gun. 

     ETHAN reaches into his jacket and holds up a hefty wad of 
     currency. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Max made a deal with you? 

                          ETHAN
                I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. 

                          CLAIRE 
                We've got seventy-five rounds for your 
                Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig 
                Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with 
                monitor, plenty of passports. You said 
                it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with 
                you. 

                          ETHAN 
                You're sure about this? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Jim was my husband. I want to know who 
                killed him. ( ALT ) I want to get the son 
                of a bitch who did this. 

                          ETHAN
                We need help, and we don't have time. 
                They have to be local. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What kind of help? 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     The KY57 crypto phone, a black box with an ordinary phone 
     receiver in the top, THUNKS down on the table. 

     ETHAN plugs the phone cable from his laptop into the back. 
     The green display on top of the KY57 dials a number and makes 
     a computer connection. 

     On the computer, the screen says: 

                I.M.F. PERSONNEL DATABASE 
                ENTER PASSWORD NOW

     ETHAN types a password and the screen asks him for the 

                CATEGORY?

     He types in a single word. 

                DISAVOWED

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. TRAIN - STATEROOM - NIGHT
        
     The word "disavowed" dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a 
     high speed train, where the newly assembled IM force has 
     gathered around a table -- KRIEGER, a dangerous-looking 
     Frenchman of forty or so, LUTHER STICKELL, a muscular, soft- 
     spoken American in his mid-thirties.  ETHAN, and CLAIRE. 
     LUTHER regards the others warily. 

                          ETHAN
                Simple game.  Four players. 
                     (points to Krieger) 
                Exfil opens the pocket -- 
                     (and to Luther)
                -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Bank? 

                          ETHAN 
                IMF mainframe. 

                          KRIEGER 
                     (after a moment) 
                Where exactly is it? 

                          ETHAN 
                In Langley. 

                          LUTHER 
                In Langley?  The one in Virginia, Langley? 

                          KRIEGER 
                Inside CIA headquarters at Langley. 

     ETHAN nods.  KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE. 

                          KRIEGER (CONT'D) 
                Is he serious? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Always. 

                          KRIEGER 
                If we're going to Virginia, why don't we 
                drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a 
                helicopter right in through the lobby and  
                set it down inside the vault and it will 
                be a hell of a lot easier than breaking 
                into the God damn CIA. 

                          LUTHER 
                What are we downloading? 

                          ETHAN 
                Information. 

                          LUTHER 
                What kind? 

                          ETHAN 
                Profitable. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Payment on delivery. 

                          LUTHER 
                I don't know.  This I don't know. 

                          ETHAN
                This doesn't sound like the Luther 
                Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used 
                to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas 
                Phreak?  The only man alive who actually 
                hacked NATO Ghostcom. 

                          LUTHER 
                There was never any physical evidence 
                that I had anything to do with that.. 
                that.. 
                     (correcting himself) 
                With that exceptional piece of work. 

                          ETHAN 
                You don't know what you're missing. This 
                is the Mt. Everest of hacks. 

                          LUTHER 
                You're all kidding yourselves. Even with 
                top of the line crypto.  Cray access. 
                STU 3's -- 

                          CLAIRE 
                Krieger can get it. 
                     (to Krieger) 
                Right? 

                          KRIEGER 
                May take a little time. 

                          ETHAN
                May take a little time. That's not what 
                Claire tells me about you. 

                          LUTHER 
                Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking 
                about the 686 prototypes -- with the 
                artificial intelligence Risk chip -- 

     ETHAN looks at KRIEGER. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Twenty-four hours. 

     ETHAN looks back at LUTHER.  LUTHER thinks. 

                          LUTHER 
                And I get to keep the equipment when 
                we're done. 

                          ETHAN 
                Luther, I guess you're all out of 
                excuses.

                          LUTHER 
                I can't just hack my way inside.  There's 
                no modem access to the mainframe, it's in 
                a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically 
                at the terminal. 

                          ETHAN 
                Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. 
                The terminal's in black vault lock-down. 

     INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY

     While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: 

     A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file 
     folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters 
     building.  He comes to an impressive guard station and rests 
     his chin on a strange-looking optometric device. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                They missed nothing in that room.  Even 
                the vents have laser nets over them.  

     Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into 
     a "RESTRICTED" area of the building. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY

     The ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain 
     aside and comes to a large, vaulted door.  He slides a card- 
     key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key 
     into the slot beneath it. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.)
                Inside, there are three countermeasure 
                systems that can only be deactivated by 
                authorized entry.  Which we won't have. 

     A panel next to the ANALYST says "INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES 
     OFF."  The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, 
     CHUNKS the door open and steps into -- 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     -- the secured terminal room.  It's not large but it's 
     impressive.  A single terminal is bolted into the middle of 
     the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook 
     computer storage towers. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                The first system is sound-sensitive, 
                anything above a whisper sets it off. 
                The second system is on the floor and 
                pressure-sensitive --

     The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across 
     the room.  As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his 
     feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                --and the third detects any increase in 
                temperature.  Even the body heat of an 
                unauthorized person in the room will 
                trigger it. 

     A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 
     degrees.  The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the 
     computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                All three systems are state of the art. 
                
     The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  A drop of 
     condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it 
     makes contact, the floor panel lights up. 

     INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT

     The other team members gathered around the table look at 
     ETHAN skeptically. 

                          LUTHER 
                And you really think we can do this. 

     INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT 

     The middle of the night and the train is dark. The team 
     members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER 
     heads in one direction, ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other.

     ETHAN stops.  His attention is drawn to the car ahead. There 
     is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it. 

     ETHAN'S P.O.V. THRU WINDOW (INT. BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)

     Ethan sees the business car, a plush space for busy 
     executives to get some work done on the train. There are 
     laptops, cellular phones, desks that fold out in front of 
     spacious seats. 

     A FEMALE EXECUTIVE, forty or so, is seated at one of the 
     desks, typing away into her laptop. 

     INT. TRAIN - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     ETHAN knocks on the compartment door. 

                          ETHAN 
                May I come in? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (wary but interested) 
                Sure... 

     INT. TRAIN - CLAIREíS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT                              

     ETHAN and CLAIRE enter, ETHAN closing the compartment door. 
     He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her. 
     She takes it, waits. 

                          ETHAN 
                It's cash. And a second passport. If 
                anything goes wrong when we're inside, if 
                you sense even the slightest deviation 
                don't look over your shoulder, you walk 
                away - you hear me? Just walk away. 

                          CLAIRE 
                You don't think we're going to make it. 

                          ETHAN 
                I didn't say that. 

                          CLAIRE 
                You didn't have to......... 

                          ETHAN
                I just need you to be safe. 

                          CLAIRE
                What about you? 

                          ETHAN
                What about me - Jim called an abort - I 
                didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just 
                need you to be safe. 

     CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to 
     take it in. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. 

     And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing 
     and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly 
     resists.  He senses it and pulls away.  

                          ETHAN 
                Sorry. 

     He rises and goes to the door.  He's got his hand on the knob 
     when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him 
     to her and kisses him, deeply.  This time they sink slowly to 
     the bed. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. CIA LANGLEY - DAY 

     Seen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex, 
     two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked 
     out of a thick forest. 

                          LANGLEY

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY 

     KITTRIDGE, BARNES, and their STAFF are hard at work, 
     photographs and biographical data of ETHAN on various 
     computer and television screens around the room.  KITTRIDGE 
     leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. 

                          BARNES 
                What I want to know is how Hunt accessed 
                the disavowed file, even after we cut off 
                his authorization code. 

                          AGENT LOWDEN/AGENT 
                          MAREK 
                He may have used Phelps' code. They were 
                friends, and Phelps, was still valid for 
                twenty-four hours.  

                          BARNES 
                If that's the case, we need to implement 
                a system to immediately deactivate an 
                agent's code immediately... 

        KITTRIDGE brings his chair legs down on the floor with a 
        BANG. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I can't believe what I'm listening to. 
                Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys 
                are standing here trying to figure out 
                what kind of shoes he had on!  I don't
                care how he did it, I want to know why he 
                did it!  Is he recruiting?  For what 
                purpose? 

     From somewhere in the building, an ALARM sounds, not too loud 
     in here. 

                          AGENT PAT/AGENT 
                          LOWDEN 
                Survival. 

     The alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the 
     building. 

                          KITTRIDGE
                Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive,
                he initiates.  The question is what does 
                he want now and where does he need to get 
                it and Barnes what the hell is that
                noise?! 

     An AGENT is just coming in from the hallway. 

                          AGENT 
                Fire alarm, Gene. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Oh, for -- do we have to evacuate? 

                          BARNES
                That's S.O.P.. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                S.O.P.. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. VIRGINIA TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

     SIRENS BLARING, three fire trucks race past an inconspicuous 
     gray van parked on the shoulder of a two lane highway. 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY LOBBY - DAY                               

     Three FIREMEN stomp into the main lobby of the CIA 
     headquarters building.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are among them, in 
     firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment.  

     ETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk.  He 
     looks up, above him. 

     Etched into the top of one wall are the words "AND YE SHALL 
     KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE."

     They reach the GUARD.  ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows 
     to the front of the group and takes charge. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to the Guard) 
                We picked up alarms in sectors three, 
                seven, and twelve. 

     The GUARD checks a screen in front of him. 

                          GUARD RICHARD 
                Yeah.  That's what I've got too. 

     The FIREMEN look at each other.  Who is this guy?  But he 
     seems to know what he's talking about, so -- 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to the Guard) 
                What sector's the air conditioning? 

                          GUARD RANDALL 
                Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in 
                sector twenty-one. 

                          ETHAN 
                I gotta go in there and shut it down! 

                          GUARD RANDALL 
                Nobody goes into any sector where the 
                alarm didn't go off. 

                          ETHAN
                Do you want to blow the fire through the 
                whole building? 

                          GUARD RICHARD 
                     (reciting policy) 
                Nobody goes into any sector where the 
                alarm did not go off --

     EXT. CIA LANGLEY - PARKING AREA - DAY                            

     One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the 
     parking area of the headquarters building.  Second truck 
     roars past.  LUTHER watches it go. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

     LUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of 
     equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- 
     dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company 
     manuals with names like "COSMOS" and "SWITCHED ACCESS 
     SERVICE." 

     One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image 
     in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn 
     GUARD, who's finishing his sentence. 
        
                          GUARD 
                     (on screen) 
                --and it did not go off in twenty-one! 

     LUTHER turns to a screen on another computer and searches 
     through a complex facilities menu. 

                          LUTHER 
                     (mouths) 
                Twenty-one, twenty-one --

     He finds what he's looking for and double clicks on it.  A 
     red box on his screen lights up -- 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY                               

     -- and the same red box lights up on the GUARD'S screen. 
     From in the distance, a new ALARM begins to wail. 

                          GUARD RANDALL 
                Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go. 

                          ETHAN
                Let's move! 

     ETHAN turns and looks at one of the FIREMEN behind them -- 
     it's CLAIRE.  CLAIRE and KRIEGER follow ETHAN/GUARD to 
     corridor. 

     INT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY 

     CLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing 
     a business suit underneath.  She clips an ID tag to her 
     breast pocket.  

     She pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer 
     printout of a man's ID photo.  She stares at the face, 
     studying it. 

     INT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY 

     CLAIRE, carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin, looks for a 
     spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters 
     building. 

     She sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper.  It's the 
     man whose picture she looked at in the storage room.  She 
     sits next to him. 

     He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then 
     goes back to his paper. 

     He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing 
     the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a 
     perfume sampler.  She dumps the clear liquid contents into 
     his coffee.  He turns back and hands her part of the paper. 
     CLAIRE smiles. 

     COFFEE MAN drinks up.  CLAIRE stares at his shoulder 
     strangely.  He notices. 

     She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. 

     He smiles.  But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder 
     blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of 
     shiny gray metallic tape.  CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE 
     MAN drinks up and leaves the table. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

     LUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a 
     blueprint of the inside of the building.  A cursor begins to 
     flash in one of the rooms.  LUTHER smiles. 

                          LUTHER 
                Hi there. 

     INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY                               

     A GUARD carrying an MP5, a handheld machine gun, leads ETHAN 
     and KRIEGER to a heavy metal door marked SERVICE. 

                          GUARD 
                Air conditioning's through here! 

     They turn a corner, walking directly past -- 

     -- COFFEE MAN, who's coming the other way.  We stay with 
     COFFEE MAN. 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY - CORRIDORS - DAY                            
        
     COFFEE MAN comes out of the cafeteria, walks down the 
     corridor. he goes to the restricted access door, taps the 
     control panel. 

                          CIA ANALYST
                William Donloe. 

     COFFEE MAN (ANALYST) walks past a GUARD desk and peers into 
     an optometric scanner and we suddenly remember where we've 
     seen COFFEE MAN before.  He's the TECHNICIAN who works at the 
     secured computer terminal. 

     INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY 

     ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing.  ETHAN 
     putting the mask in a bag. 

     The GUARD returns. 

                          GUARD 
                Where's the other guy? 

     The GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing 
     him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the 
     neck.  He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. 
     KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. 

     ETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER 
     pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with 
     the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - 

     -- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife 
     arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S 
     face in warning. 

                          ETHAN 
                Zero body count. 

                          KRIEGER 
                     (a threat) 
                We'll see.  

                          ETHAN
                Time up. 

     ETHAN releases him and walks away. 

     INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY 

     The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area 
     Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the 
     duct system. 

     The first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under 
     ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to 
     climb. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY 

     ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving 
     horizontally now.  They reach a juncture and turn right. 

                          ETHAN 
                1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast.  Luther, I'm 
                going in.  Don't disappoint me...Krieger, 
                from here on in, absolute silence. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                             

     ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct.  A 
     laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- 
     crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. 

     He can see the computer room below and the top of the 
     TECHNICIAN'S head. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                              

     In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of 
     his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- 
     sided, pyramid shaped glass object.  

     ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of 
     the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what 
     it is -- a prism. 

     The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully 
     moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and 
     directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the 
     shaft. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

     Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move 
     in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready 
     to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between 
     the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. 

     The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the 
     floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip 
     with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. 

     The screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole 
     shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. 

     It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. 

     A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop 
     near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A 
     gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the 
     tube, cooling the room. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the 
     terminal room. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw 
     earlier.  No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the 
     gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. 

     Now ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair 
     falling in front of him. 

     At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, 
     but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then 
     shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his 
     ankles and understand.  

     He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and 
     temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is 
     lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the 
     computer as the ANALYST enters the room. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                  

     The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack 
     of work to his right. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                    

     The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer.  He pauses 
     and wipes some sweat from his forehead. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                      

     With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. 
     It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead -- 

                          TECHNICIAN 
                Oh, God. 

     -- he vomits.  

     He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again.  Puzzled, 
     sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to 
     his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY                             

     Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the 
     alarm systems with a card-key.  They HUM back to life 
     efficiently, a light flashing: 

                INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                   

     ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the 
     same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in 
     front of the computer. 

     A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a 
     rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the 
     set of pulleys. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY 

     KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out 
     on his forehead. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     Unfortunately, he's three feet away from it.  He stretches 
     his arms but can't reach. 

     He blinks, unable to believe this.  He curls himself into a 
     situp and looks up, into the shaft. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                      

     KRIEGER sees the predicament. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor.  Slowly, 
     KRIEGER drops him another few feet.  Now ETHAN's lower than 
     the terminal and still three feet away from it. 
        
     He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another 
     situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                 

     In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco 
     monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what 
     ETHAN sees. 

     He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and 
     begins to whisper.  We hear only the moist, airy sound of his 
     breath, not the words. 

                          LUTHER 
                Type this password: AW96B6.  Return.  Go

                list. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     ETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly.  He reaches 
     out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it
     and starts typing, softly. 

     The computer HUMS, activated.  ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, 
     withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy 
     drive. 

     The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR.  ETHAN winces, even 
     that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.  

     But no alarms go off. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          

     LUTHER cranes his head again to see the computer terminal 
     through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint.  He WHISPERS more 
     commands.

                          LUTHER 
                Ok, good!  It's scrolling.  0K, now we're

                When it's all green it's done. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     ETHAN types in the contends, presses enter and the screen 
     displays a comforting message:

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                           

     LUTHER'S eyes widen as he gets his first look, on the Visco 
     monitor, of the specific information they're downloading. 
     The NOC list. 

                          LUTHER 
                Holy mother of God. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                                

     KRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope.  His eyes 
     suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. 

     It's a rat.  KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back.  Neither 
     moves.  Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls 
     forward, inquisitive. 

     KRIEGER's eyes water, his nose twitches.  He's about to 
     sneeze. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          

     LUTHER pulls himself together and WHISPERS another command 
     into the microphone. 

                          LUTHER 
                You've done it.  Eject it. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

     The 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive.  ETHAN pockets 
     it and signals to be raised. 

     Slowly, his body starts to move up.  As it does, a bead of 
     sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. 

     ETHAN ignores it.  But below him, he sees the floor tiles, 
     four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the 
     computer terminal.  

     His eyes widen as he realizes something -- 

     --the drop of sweat falls -- 

     --and he catches it with his right hand. 

     INT. CIA - MEN'S - DAY                                    

     CIA ANALYST crosses corridor from restricted access door to 
     bathroom. 

     A toilet FLUSHES, smashing the silence, and the TECHNICIAN 
     staggers out of the bathroom. He goes to the sink and throws 
     some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of 
     shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade. 

     He walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                       

     On one of LUTHER'S laptops, the blinking cursor starts to 
     move down a corridor.  LUTHER speaks into his microphone. 

                          LUTHER 
                He's rolling.  Get moving! 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

     ETHAN is near the ceiling, but KRIEGER isn't pulling any 
     more.  ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull 
     him up.  KRIEGER shakes his head no. 

     ETHAN gestures -- "WHAT?!" 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

     ETHAN still dangles.  Holding the rope with one hand, KRIEGER 
     holds out his other, demanding something.  He wants the disk. 

     INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY                             

     The TECHNICIAN makes his way back down the corridor, toward 
     the computer room.

     is sweating.

     ETHAN, still hanging upside down, has refused.  KRIEGER 
     demands again.

     ETHAN has the diskette in his mouth.  KRIEGER leans down and 
     takes it.  He drops the knife. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Merci. 

                          ETHAN 
                We're not outta here yet. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY 

     The TECHNICIAN deactivates the alarm systems, swings the 
     door open and comes back into the room.  

     He turns to close the door behind him and in so doing just 
     misses seeing ETHAN'S head as it is pulled back up into the 
     ceiling.

     frantically back through the duct, the way they came. 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY                              

     CLAIRE walks quickly past the GUARDS in the reception area 
     and out of the building. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     The TECHNICIAN enters the room and shuts the door.  He sees 
     the knife, picks it up, looks at it and then puts it down. 
     He resumes his work at the computer but when he punches up 
     his program, something prints out on his screen.  Its header: 

                KEYSTROKE LOG -- FILE DOWNLOAD 
                    11/18/95 9.58 AM

     And it goes on.  The TECHNICIAN'S eyes widen in disbelief. 
     He spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest 
     telephone. 

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY                           

     In the communications room, tempers are running a little 
     high.  KITTRIDGE is on his feet, berating his staff. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Think, for Christ's sake, you guys are 
                mired in detail, open your minds, it's 
                gotta be staring us in the face!  What 
                does Ethan Hunt want?! 

                          BARNES 
                Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same 
                thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list! 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Okay! 

     Now it's coming together in KITTRIDGE'S mind and a horrible 
     thought occurs to him. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                And where is the list vulnerable? 

     There is nervous silence for a moment.  Behind KITTRIDGE, on 
     the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. 

     An AGENT gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the 
     room. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                     (joking) 
                Other than here. 

     Nervous laughter goes around the table.  It fades.  On the 
     other side of the room, the AGENT who answered the phone 
     turns, receiver in hand, face ashen. 

     He holds the phone out to KITTRIDGE, terrified, the bearer of 
     extremely bad news. 

     They all turn slowly and look at him.  He holds the phone out 
     to KITTRIDGE, shaking slightly. 

                          AGENT 
                It's for you. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Kittridge, yup?

     It may be a HUMAN SCREAM or it may be a SIREN'S WAIL but it 
     echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck ROARS away from 
     the headquarters building, making its escape. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                                

     LUTHER, KRIEGER, CLAIRE and ETHAN, the victorious team, are 
     in the truck's cab.  They exchange looks of massive relief. 
     But no one speaks.  LUTHER, in particular, looks heavily 
     troubled by what they've just done. 

     ETHAN looks at CLAIRE, who is jammed into the seat next to 
     him.  She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted. 

     KRIEGER, in the driver's seat literally and figuratively. 

     ETHAN just looks straight ahead and to CLAIRE. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY                           

     The TECHNICIAN who discovered the theft of the list sits at 
     one end of the now-empty conference table in the 
     communications room.  KITTRIDGE sits in a chair beside, 
     staring gravely at him. 

     He gets up and walks to the door, where HARRY BARNES hovers. 
     KITTRIDGE lowers his voice, it's barely audible. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                     (to Barnes) 
                You and I know about this -- and that's 
                where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened. 

                          BARNES 
                What about him...? 

     He gestures to the TECHNICIAN, who watches them anxiously. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I want him manning a radar tower in 
                Alaska by the end of the day.  Just mail 
                him his clothes. 

     He leaves.  Barnes turns to the TECHNICIAN, who looks up at 
     him anxiously. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. LONDON - NIGHT                                       

     Night. This street is a row of nondescript hotels, one after 
     the other, with anonymous names like "Hotel Pomeroy," "Hotel 
     Vincent," and "Hotel Berridge." 

                          LONDON 

     INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                            

     This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of 
     buildings it's in.  ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight 
     bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered 
     bible he's used to contact Max.  He flips through the pages 
     and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and 
     waiting on the tiny desk. 

     LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously 
     preoccupied.  KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a 
     lager and watching CNN. 

     CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. 

     KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. 

                          KRIEGER 
                You contacting your buyer? 
                     (no answer) 
                Ethan? 

     From the desk, ETHAN glances up.  Then goes back to the 
     computer.  KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. 

                          KRIEGER (CONT'D) 
                Ethan?  Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? 

     ETHAN ignores him, working.  His computer jams with static as 
     it connects to a BBS.  The screen blinks and displays the 
     familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted 
     Max.  When it asks him which chapter and verse for the 
     posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next 
     code.  He  begins to type. 

                MAX -- Now might be an excellent time 
                to interpret Scripture face to face. 
                Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.  Take 
                seat 27.  Bring our mutual friend 
                Job.

     KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible 
     out of Ethan's hands to the floor. 

                          KRIEGER 
                You're not going to any meeting without me. 

                          ETHAN 
                My contact is extremely shy. 

     He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the 
     "ENTER" button. 

     LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN 
     sighs and stands up.  KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took 
     from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. 

                          KRIEGER 
                I don't think you're in any position to 
                give orders, do you?  Not while I'm 
                holding this. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Krieger. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Stay out of this. 
                OR 
                Lachez - moi 
                OR  
                T'agueue 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't you mean this? 

     He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical 
     disk.  He puts it back in his jacket pocket. 

     KRIEGER stares for a second. 

                          KRIEGER
                That's not it.  That's not the list. 

                          ETHAN 
                What's the matter, you don't know this 
                trick? 

     He holds the jacket pocket wide open, for KRIEGER to look 
     into.  KRIEGER does.  The pocket is empty. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                     (mock surprise) 
                Where did it go?!  It's GONE! 

     ETHAN walks over to CLAIRE, reaches into the pocket of the 
     trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                But not too far! 

     He palms the disk in his right hand. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                I know what you're thinking, Krieger. 
                You're thinking, back in the computer 
                room -- I was up here -- he was down 
                there -- .  He was carrying two discs. 

     While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from KRIEGER. 
     When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again.  He holds up 
     his left hand.  It's there now. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                So hard to keep track of these things. 

     ETHAN shows his hands -- now both are empty. 

                          KRIEGER 
                     (fuming) 
                Where is it? 

     ETHAN pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. 

                          ETHAN 
                I thought you had it!  Do you actually 
                think I'd let you have the NOC list? 

     KRIEGER just stares at him, shaken.  CLAIRE laughs.  KRIEGER 
     looks at her.  He turns completely red.  When he looks back 
     at ETHAN, ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and 
                Iíll cut your throat. 

     He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms 
     out, SLAMMING the door behind him.  ETHAN picks up the Bible 
     and sees Drake Hotel. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've 
                never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan. 

                          ETHAN 
                We did what we had to do. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm going to try and get some sleep. 

     She leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving ETHAN and 
     LUTHER alone. 

     ANGLE                                                      

     ETHAN waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, 
     picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off 
     carefully. 

     He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his 
     jacket pocket. 

                          LUTHER 
                Krieger did have the NOC list. 

                          ETHAN 
                Now I want you to hold onto it. 

                          LUTHER 
                What makes you trust me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Because if you knew what you were getting 
                into, you never would have done it. 

                          LUTHER 
                I'm not letting this list get out in the 
                open. 

                          ETHAN 
                Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on 
                the train, you can't let this list get 
                out into the open.  What's the range of 
                this thing? 

                          LUTHER 
                It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be 
                close. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'll get you close. 

     Claire opens the door. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Ethan I need to talk to you. 

     ETHAN follows CLAIRE into her room where she shows him the 
     television screen.

                involved in a global drug distribution 
                network. 

     A public official exits the building.  The reporter and other 
     news crews charge up to him. 

                          REPORTER 
                Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment 
                please. 

     The image on the television changes to an interview with a 
     PUBLIC OFFICIAL who faces a bank of microphones. 

                          PUBLIC OFFICIAL 
                I think it's sad, really.  Farmers, 
                unless they're a conglomerate, are always 
                operating on a paper-thin margin.  I'm 
                afraid what we have here is a case of a 
                naive and lonely widow with a lot of 
                financial problems who chose to make 
                money through illegal means. 

                          REPORTER 
                That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in 
                charge of this investigation.  Officials 
                tell me that international law 
                enforcement agents are expected to arrive 
                here later today to question the Hunts. 
                This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, 
                Wisconsin. 

     BACK TO SCENE                                               

                          ETHAN 
                Kittridge... 

                          CLAIRE 
                Bastard! 

     ETHAN switches TV off and paces away from it.  His anger 
     erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a 
     chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the 
     wall.  CLAIRE tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her 
     away. 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't...don't touch me... 

     CAMERA SWING PANS between them. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What are you going to do? 

                          ETHAN 
                     (turns to her and gestures at TV) 
                He's expecting my call. 
                     (strides to door) 
                I'm going to the station... 
                     (o/s at door) 
                And I'm going to call him. 

     EXT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - RAIN - NIGHT                           

     ETHAN comes out from a side street by Liverpool Street 
     Underground Station and crosses the road to the main station. 
     CLAIRE watches him from the window. 

     INT. LONDON TERMINUS RAILWAY STATION - NIGHT                        

     ETHAN hurries down escalator.  CAMERA MOVES IN on him.  He 
     crosses to the TELEPHONE BOXES. He starts to dial a number. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT                             

     A light flashes and a phone BUZZES.  KITTRIDGE in shirt and 
     tie, picks up.  BARNES and several other AGENTS are 
     monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities 
     related to the Hunt case. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (picking up) 
                Kittridge. 

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                I see you've been out visiting the folks. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (covers receiver) 
                It's Hunt.  What do you need for a 
                pinpoint? 
                     (to Ethan) 
                Been watching a little T.V., have you? 

     One of the technicians frantically scratches something on a 
     piece of foolscap and waves it at KITTRIDGE:  "80 SECONDS". 

     KITTRIDGE nods. 

     EXT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT                             

                          ETHAN
                Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was 
                an especially nice touch. 

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT                           

     At the console, the number 44 flashes on the TECHNICIAN'S 
     screen. 

                          TECHNICIAN 
                He's in England. 

     BARNES scratches England and 22 seconds on foolscap and waves 
     it. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (covering receiver) 
                Get MI5. 

     The TECHNICIAN opens another line on his console and begins 
     patching through to Whitehall. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Ethan, I want to reassure you that my 
                first order of business after you come in 
                is to get these ridiculous charges 
                against your family dropped and 
                eliminated completely from their files. 
                Come in now, we can plea down the charges 
                against you as well. 

     The wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down.  The 
     TECHNICIAN is frantically signalling KITTRIDGE to keep 
     talking.  KITTRIDGE is momentarily stuck.  Fortunately: 

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                Can I ask you something, Kittridge? 
                
                          KITTRIDGE 
                Certainly Ethan. 

     INT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT                             

                          ETHAN 
                If you're dealing with someone who's 
                crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five 
                members of his own IMF team, how 
                devastated do you think you're going to 
                make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald 
                down to the county courthouse? 

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT                            

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? 

     Click.  ETHAN has hung up.  KITTRIDGE looks hopefully to the 
     TECHNICIAN who says: 

                          BARNES 
                Lost him.  We needed three more seconds. 

     Surprisingly KITTRIDGE is not as upset as he is puzzled. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                He wanted us to know he was in London. 

     Clearly that's the question that KITTRIDGE is turning over in 
     his mind and he doesn't have a simple answer to it. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT                           

     Close Digital clock.  It reads 23.59.  Angle widens to show 
     ETHAN looking at it with grim satisfaction.  He opens the 
     door of the phone booth and almost SMACKS right into -- 

     --the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just 
     inches in front of him.  Startled, ETHAN looks up, but what 
     he sees shakes him to the core. 

     The man is JIM PHELPS. 

     ETHAN SHOUTS and almost falls back into the phone booth. 
     PHELPS leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly. 

                          PHELPS 
                You're a hard man to catch up with. 
                
     PHELPS falls towards ETHAN.  ETHAN tries to speak, but can't 
     even form words. 

     INT - RAILWAY STATION CAFE (DAY) 

     ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth, PHELPS 
     looking clammy and listing to one side.  But the banter 
     seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close 
     colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, 
     finishing each other's sentences: 

                          PHELPS
                ..the next day I managed to drag myself 
                to the safe house, must've just missed 
                you..anyway, I checked our aliases.

                          ETHAN
                - and picked us up in the States -

                          PHELPS 
                - but you left before I could get there 
                and I could check just so many places.. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize 
                customs records - 

                          PHELPS 
                - so I watched Europe. Once you showed 
                up in England..it was easy. 

                          ETHAN 
                You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool 
                Street. 

                          PHELPS 
                Hey, I showed 'em to you! 

                          ETHAN 
                I remember.. 

     PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an 
     upright position.  He opens a medicine bottle and takes the 
     pain killers. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A 
                doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't 
                sit up straight. 

                          PHELPS 
                I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit 
                up straight very well.  It's not 
                important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I 
                saw the mole.  It was Kittridge. 
                     (a fist into the table) 
                Kittridge! 

     PHELPS grips the sides of the table. 

                          ETHAN 
                Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the 
                mole? 

                          PHELPS 
                Yeah. 

                          ETHAN 
                How did Kittridge do it?.. 

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT                           

     A reprise of PHELPS'S narrative only now ETHAN'S telling it 
     and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually 
     happened. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                - first he took care of Jack in the 
                elevator - 
        
     At the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the 
     building, watching it go and crush Kiefer. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                - he shot you on the bridge - 

     On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the 
     gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them 
     into the Vltava River. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                - he must have had back up take out 
                Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.. 

     There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER 
     who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence.. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                How did he do Hannah? 

     Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the 
     detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion 
     brilliant behind her... 

                          ETHAN VO 
                No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah 
                himself. 

     PHELPS presses the remote detonator and the car blows.. 

     OVER SHOULDER - PHELPS (INT. RAILWAY CAFE)

     ETHAN looking intently at him.

                          ETHAN
                Why, Jim?  Why?

     Awkward moment.

                          PHELPS
                ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was
                inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more
                secrets you keep from everyone but
                yourself, operations you answer to no one
                but yourself.  Then one morning you wake
                up and find out the President of the
                United States is running the country -
                without your permission.  The son-of-a-
                bitch!  How dare he?  You realize itís
                over, youíre an obsolete piece of
                hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got
                a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a 
                year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no
                good son-of-a-bitch, big time!

                          ETHAN
                We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after
                us.

                          PHELPS
                Whatís going to make him do that?

                          ETHAN
                What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC
                list.

                          PHELPS
                Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.

                          ETHAN
                A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to
                Paris.

                          PHELPS
                Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.

                          ETHAN
                If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to
                Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.
                Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with
                me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will
                have helicopter transport waiting in
                Paris.

     PHELPS looks away.  Seems badly shaken.

                          ETHAN
                Jim...?

                          PHELPS
                I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you
                and suddenly there she was, standing in
                the rain just outside the safe
                house..alive and beautiful..and thinking
                Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís
                had to do forget about me to keep going
                and get the job done, I..

     PHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle
     over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it:

                          PHELPS
                - no.  She canít know about me.  No one
                can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too
                much at stake, Ethan.

                          ETHAN
                Youíre probably right.

                          PHELPS
                I usually am.

                          ETHAN
                Once we leave the safehouse, get in there
                and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.

                          PHELPS
                You got it.

                          ETHAN
                And get a doctor.

                          PHELPS
                Good luck.

     INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - CLAIREíS ROOM - NIGHT

     The door to CLAIRE'S room in the safe house opens, throwing a
     shaft of light over her form.  ETHAN creeps in and closes the
     door behind him.

     It is approximately one a.m. .  CLAIRE is huddled in the
     corner.  ETHAN enters and stands looking at her.

                          CLAIRE
                What happened?

                          ETHAN
                  (walks towards her)
                I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for
                tomorrow.

                          CLAIRE
                Okay...

                          ETHAN 
                  (he steps towards her, stops)
                Is this the only way?

                          CLAIRE
                Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

     She draws him down by his hand to kiss her.

     He kisses her again, more fully.  She wraps an arm around him
     and he holds onto the kiss.  The room appears to revolve
     around them.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. PRIVATE HELIPAD - DAY

     Suddenly itís bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our
     eyes.

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking
     at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.

     TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall
     into step alongside, ready to brief him.  One of them holds
     out a small package with "for Job" written on it.

     KITTRIDGE looks at him.  He rips it open.  A note inside
     simply says:

                      TGV.  LONDON TERMINUS
                              Noon.

     KITTRIDGE looks at his watch.  Itís ten to twelve.

     As he reads the note, something else falls out of the
     envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.

     He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.  Cradled in his
     hand, we canít see what it is.  But to him, itís very
     interesting.

     He steps up his pace, headed for the car.

                          KITTRIDGE
                     (to the Agent) 
                How long to the London Terminus?

                          AGENT
                Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Youíve got ten.  Move!

     INT. WATERLOO STATION PLATFORM - DAY

     The sleek front power car, looking like the nose of an SST,
     gets its 25,000 volt charge from the overhead catenary.

     The rear power car gets its jolt.

     The TGV starts to move, pulling out of the station.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     The business car is similar to the one ETHAN saw on the first
     train they look across Europe.  Itís crowded, maybe THIRTY
     MEN and WOMEN in suits, most of them already immersed in work
     on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones.

     One such woman is MAX in her seat, number 27.  MATTHIAS and
     the OTHER MAN, last seen dropping off ETHAN in Prague, sit
     across from her, her laptop is on the table next to her, in
     her briefcase.

                          MAX
                How long until we reach the Chunnel?

                          MATTHIAS
                Twenty minutes.

     INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY

     A MAN puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on
     the bunk-bed.  We only see his hands as he proceeds to take
     the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and
     assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous
     electrical parts inside.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     MAX is reading the Financial Times.  MATTHIAS is looking out
     of the window.  A cellular phone rings inside MAXís briefcase
     in front of MATTHIAS.  MATTHIAS takes the phone out.

                          MATTHIAS
                Yes...
                     (holds phone out for Max)
                Itís him.

                          MAX
                     (into phone) 
                This wasnít what we discussed.

                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                     (on phone) 
                My apologies Max.  Couldnít be helped.
                Thereís a piece of black cloth under your
                seat.  Tear it away and youíll find the
                disk.

     MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer
     disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off
     the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the
     computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns
     the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to
     see.

     One half of the screen, with the heading "CRYPTONYM AND
     OPERATIONAL SPECS" is already jammed with information.  The
     blank second half of the screen acquires the title "TRUE
     NAME," and information starts filling itself in rapidly --
     names, addresses, identities.

     As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:

                IDENTITY MATCH

                          MAX
                     (back into phone) 
                Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít
                prelude a meeting in private.

                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you
                tell me where the money is.

                          MAX
                The possibility alone is worth ten
                million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver
                briefcase.  Combination 314.

                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                What about Job?

                          MAX
                I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve
                got the money -- heíll find you.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE)

     LUTHER, three rows behind in another seat, is at work on a
     laptop of his own.  A mobile Nokia phone is beside it - red
     light flashing.

     INT. SECOND CLASS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car.  They
     turn around and start working their way back again.

     At the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate.  A LARGE MAN
     passes through the door behind her.

     The LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES,
     who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order
     to make room for him to pass.  As they move by him, their
     vision is momentarily blocked --

     -- and CLAIRE gets up to follow.

     She follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the
     door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in
     doorway.

                          BARNES
                Only four more cars.

                          KITTRIDGE
                And if we donít find him - weíll search
                the whole train again.

                          BARNES
                Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?

                          KITTRIDGE
                High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No-
                one gets off.  High security.  Good place
                for a pass off to Max.

                          BARNES
                But why tell us?

                          KITTRIDGE
                Heís putting on a show, Barnes.

                          BARNES
                What kind of show.

                          KITTRIDGE
                I donít know.
                     (looks at his wrist monitor)
                It didnít say on the tickets.

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES go off back through the next coach.
     CLAIRE follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into
     her wristwatch to ETHAN:

                          CLAIRE
                Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.

                          ETHAN
                Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How
                far is he from Luther?

                          CLAIRE
                Two cars.  Where are you?

                          ETHAN
                You are my eyes.  Stay with him.

     She moves onto the next coach, going after KITTRIDGE and
     BARNES.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY

     On her computer screen in the business car, an ominous
     message flashes.

                LIST COMPLETE

     MAX dials a number on her cellular phone. She is calling Job.

                          MAX
                     (into phone)
                Heís in the baggage car.

                          PHELPS (O/S)
                     (assembling gun in sleeping
                     compartment)
                Iíll be there.

     MAX hangs up and hands the phone to MATTHIAS who slots it
     into the briefcase next to the computer.  He dials a number
     on the keyboard and pushes send.  The computer emits a DIAL
     TONE.  Her computer flashes a message.

                MODEM DENIED

                          MAX
                Whatís the problem.

                          MATTHIAS
                Connection denied.

                          MAX
                Try it again.

                          MATTHIAS
                Itís not working.

                          MAX
                Is something wrong with the phone?
                  (Pause as he tries the phone)
                Well is something wrong with the
                batteries?

                          MATTHIAS
                I always check the batteries.

                          MAX
                Run it through from the top.

     INT. REAR CAR (SLEEPING COMPARTMENT) - MOVING - DAY

     The MAN assembling the gun CLICKS the last piece, the
     silencer, into place.

     INT. CAR (NEXT TO MAXíS CAR) - MOVING - DAY

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES looking - stop in doorway.

                          BARNES
                Nothing but civilians, Gene.

                          KITTRIDGE
                This is bullshit - we donít even know
                what Max looks like.

                          BARNES
                Maybe we donít have to know what he looks
                like.  If heís got that list, heís going
                to want to check it.  We should be
                looking for laptops.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Good idea.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - (LUTHER) - MOVING - DAY

     LUTHER sees them coming.  He smacks the laptop shut and
     positions his jamming phone on the table to point at Maxís
     computer.  He gets up, taking his computer with him, headed
     for the rear of the car.  A WAITER sees the phone and goes
     after LUTHER with it.

                          WAITER
                Excuse me, Sir, your telephone...

     OTHER PASSENGERSí phones nearby go haywire.  LUTHER looks to
     MAX.  Exits car.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY

     Her dial tone finally hits the static of a computer
     connection and the message on her screen changes:

                TRANSFER IN PROGRESS

                          MATTHIAS
                Itís working.

                          MAX
                Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     LUTHER shuts himself in the bathroom.  The OTHER MAN follows
     him, tries the door and waits his moment.  The OTHER MAN
     bangs against the door.  LUTHER braces himself against the
     door.

     INT. ANOTHER CAR - MOVING - DAY

     CLAIRE walking through.  She pauses to listen in her
     earpiece.

                          ETHAN (O/S)
                Iíve got the money.  Meet me in the
                baggage car.

     She walks on.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES are looking at the people in the
     Business Car behind MAX.  CLAIRE passes them by heading for
     the last executive coach to get to Club and Baggage Car.  She
     passes the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.  He follows her.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Get this door open.

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES have seen CLAIRE go through MAXíS
     Business Car and past the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.
     They follow, but suspect the locked bathroom door and stop
     there to listen.

     INT. LAST EXECUTIVE CAR - MOVING - DAY

     CLAIRE moves swiftly through the last car (after MAXíS car).
     up into the Club Car and opens the door leading to the
     BAGGAGE CAR.  Goes in.  The door slams shut.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Hello, Luther.  Whereís Hunt?

                          LUTHER
                Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being
                modemed off the train.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Where?

     INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY

     CLAIRE enters a little breathless.  Spotting PHELPíS profile
     in the darkened car.

                          CLAIRE
                Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me
                Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him?
                We take the money.  Ethan takes the
                blame.  No-one else has seen you alive.
                No-one will believe him.

                          ETHAN
                Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say
                that Claire.

                          CLAIRE
                Ethan?

                          PHELPS
                Yes.  Ethan Hunt, darling.  Remember him?

     Here PHELPS pulls out his assembled pistol.

                          CLAIRE
                You knew about Jim?

                          PHELPS
                Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew
                is something of a question.  Before or
                after I showed in London, mind telling
                me, Ethan?

                          ETHAN
                Before London.  But after you took the
                Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

                          PHELPS
                They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn
                Gideons.

     PHELPíS watch alarm goes off.

                          PHELPS
                Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll
                have to be quicker than Iíd like.
                Certainly quicker than youíd like.

                          CLAIRE
                Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..

                          PHELPS
                Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk?
                Well, Claire, youíve asked the question
                and you are the answer.

                          ETHAN
                I knew about Jim.

                          PHELPS
                But, he didnít know about you.  In all
                fairness, Ethan, Claire was never
                convinced her charms would work with you.
                But I was supremely confident - having
                tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet
                thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan
                is in love with you, Claire, make no
                mistake about it.  And like all the 
                worldís lovers, heís tortured by the
                same, one pathetic question - "does she
                feel the same way I do?"

     JIM turns to CLAIRE.

                          PHELPS
                Well Claire do you?  Have you been
                exploiting his feelings or returning
                them?

                          CLAIRE
                Jim - lets just get the money and get out
                of here.

     CLAIRE goes to ETHAN.

                          CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                The money Ethan.

     ETHAN hands her the money.

                          ETHAN
                Youíve earned it.

     CLAIRE goes to Jim with the money.

                          PHELPS
                Count it.

     CLAIRE starts to count.

                          ETHAN
                Tell me something Claire, that night in
                Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up
                the car and scattered Hannah all over
                town?

                          PHELPS
                Keep counting Claire.

                          CLAIRE
                It was me.  I did it.

     CLAIRE hands PHELPS the money.


                          PHELPS
                Satisfied?

                          CLAIRE
                All ten million.

                          PHELPS
                Fold it.  Fold it tight.

                          ETHAN
                Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten
                million is better than six.

                          PHELPS
                Donít flatter yourself - six was for
                Eastern Europe.  You made a lousy deal -
                ten for the world?  What is that?  But I
                needed you for the transfer with Max.  I
                got a little extra change;  and you got a
                little extra too.

     PHELPíS watch alarm goes off.

                          PHELPS
                Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.

                          ETHAN
                Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not
                the only one whoís seen you alive.

     ETHAN throws JIM the Visco glasses.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Good morning, Mr Phelps.

     PHELPS and CLAIRE are stunned.

                          PHELPS
                You son of a bitch.

     PHELPS points the gun at ETHAN.

                          CLAIRE
                Donít Jim.

                          PHELPS
                Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You
                like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?

                          CLAIRE
                Yes.

                          ETHAN
                Jim, itís over.

                          PHELPS
                Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing
                can be more dangerous than the truth.  It
                can kill you.

     PHELPS shoots CLAIRE.  Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN.
     The gun is lost.  PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground.  His
     watch alarm beeps rapidly.  He turns, goes up the stairs
     and...

     ETHAN goes to CLAIRE.
                          
                          ETHAN
                Claire...Hey...

                          CLAIRE
                This stuff is so sticky.

                          ETHAN
                Claire.

                          CLAIRE
                Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me
                back...wonít you...

                          ETHAN 
                I always have, Claire.. 

     CLAIRE dies.  ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder. 

     INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY

     PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over 
     the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. 
     PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door 
     and climbs through it -- 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     -- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into 
     his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle 
     on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof 
     and pulls himself the rest of the way out. 

     He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the 
     smooth surface of the train. 

     Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS 
     slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and 
     replanting the cups as he goes.  

     He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the 
     back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, 
     a window for the ENGINEER. 

     Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his 
     belt.

     He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out 
     of the fog, a helicopter approaches. 

     PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is 
     going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching 
     the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen. 

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     KRIEGER is at the controls.  He sees the approaching tunnel 
     as well. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position.  Looking up, he 
     sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. 

     ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. 

     A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost 
     touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. 

     ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. 
     Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to 
     grab small holes on the roof.  

     He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other 
     way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. 

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures 
     to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing 
     over PHELPS and then back to him. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto 
     his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the 
     roof. 

     ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto 
     the roof. 

     PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously 
     closer to the chunnel entrance. 

     They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. 

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at 
     the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the 
     train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the 
     strap manages to pull himself back on. 

     -- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- 

     -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! 

     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

     As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes 
     nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes 
     one last time.  This time it says: 

                CONNECTION TERMINATED. 
                    TRANSFER LOST.

     MAX'S face falls. 

                          MAX
                Damn!

     INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY

     Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert 
     companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the 
     train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. 

                          CONDUCTOR 
                No, no, it's IN the tunnel! 

                          VOICE (O.S.) 
                Stop the train! 

                          CONDUCTOR 
                It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, 
                accelerate. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY

     For a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving 
     around to the other end of the car, we see where they've 
     gone. 

     They're dangling from either side of it. 

     PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself 
     back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other 
     cup. 

     The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track 
     and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER 
     pushing it up to full speed again. 

     But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the 
     train. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY

     PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the 
     windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of 
     KRIEGER'S copter. 

     He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the 
     other direction. 

     Another train. 

     At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the 
     oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the 
     roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as 
     it blows by. 

     The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS 
     misses the skid.  

     KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate 
     ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the 
     copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the 
     tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.  

     KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to 
     leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. 

     PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. 
     Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls 
     out -- 

     -- a red and green piece of bubble gum. 

     PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles 
     frantically for his gun. 

                          ETHAN 
                Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna 
                mother fucker. 

     ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the 
     copter's underbelly and turns away from it. 

     PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- 

     -- but the gum EXPLODES.  The force of the blast rockets 
     ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield. 

     The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers 
     wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under 
     the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. 

     ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the 
     wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. 
     It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor 
     blade barely missing his throat.  

     ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly 
     drained. 

     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

     KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by 
     BARNES.  LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to 
     them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. 

                          LUTHER
                I think this is what you're looking for. 

     MAX looks up, stunned.  KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her 
     screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to 
     wait for her to speak. 

     When she finally does, she's almost charming. 

                          MAX 
                My lawyers will have a field day with 
                this.  Entrapment, jurisdictional 
                conflicts -- 

     KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as 
     friendly. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of 
                this one. 

                          MAX 
                I'm sure we can find something I have 
                that you need. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                You know, I would love to try. 

     EXT. LONDON PUB - DAY

     LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while 
     he sips a beer.  A television screen is featuring follow-up 
     coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in 
     the chunnel.  Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of 
     a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in 
     the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was 
     there were no other fatalaties.  There are intermittent 
     sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of 
     arrivals and departures.  ETHAN into shot.  He sits beside 
     LUTHER. 

                          LUTHER 
                Reach your folks? 
                     (ETHAN nods) 
                How they feeling? 

                          ETHAN
                About what? 

                          LUTHER 
                The official apology from the Justice 
                Department, the VIP treatment, you know, 
                the whole nine yards. 

                          ETHAN 
                Well my Mother was a little confused 
                about how the DEA could mistake her and 
                Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers 
                in the Florida keys. 

     LUTHER picks up his beer. 

                          LUTHER
                     (Laughs and with a British accent) 
                Cheers. 

     They drink. 

                          ETHAN
                Here's to  you, Luther. (clink glasses)  To 
                being off the disavowed list. 

                          LUTHER 
                Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! 

                          ETHAN
                You're more than that, Luther.  They were 
                mistaken about you and they're trying to 
                show you they know it.  They want you 
                back in. 

                          LUTHER
                Sure.  They want me back in so I won't 
                break in!  They still can't figure out 
                how we did it. 

                          ETHAN 
                You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? 

                          LUTHER 
                I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back 
                pay, give me a promotion, check out my 
                office at Langley and then, maybe, talk 
                about it. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (laughing) 
                It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? 

                          LUTHER 
                Why don't you come back with me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Just don't know why I'd be doing it. 

                          LUTHER 
                You really liked Phelps, didn't you? 

                          ETHAN 
                He was a good guy for a long, long time. 
                Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta 
                catch my flight..(rising) 
                So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen 
                again? 

                          LUTHER 
                Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss 
                being disreputable. 

                          ETHAN 
                Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any 
                better I'll always think of you that way. 

     The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no 
     more.  The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a 
     moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative 
     LUTHER looking after him. 

     INT. PLANE - NIGHT 

     ETHAN HUNT slumps down in his scat, dosing. A FLIGHT 
     ATTENDANT makes her way down the aisle, holding a case filled 
     with movie cassettes. She stops before a lady passenger. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you like to watch a movie, Miss 
                Clarke? 

     She then stops before ETHAN. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Excuse me, Mr. Hunt.  Would you like to
                watch a movie.

                          ETHAN
                No, thank you.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you consider the cinema of the 
                Caribbean? 

     ETHAN just stares at her.  This couldn't be what it's 
     sounding like. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Aruba, perhaps? 

     The camera moves into ETHAN's face.  They found him.  They 
     want him back.  He looks up at her and..... 

                                                      CUT TO BLACK

     INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT

     We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American
     in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a
     corner, staring at a television screen.

     The television shows a surveillance view of the living room
     that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image
     is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get
     comfortable but he's been there a while

     ON THE SCREEN

     A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel
     room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits
     in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-
     shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the
     room behind him.  A legend:

                          KIEV

     KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,
     ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian
     godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY
     looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit
     by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is
     bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian
     which is subtitled.

                          ANATOLY
                Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called
                us.

                          KASIMOV
                     (sobbing)
                I don't remember what happened!  We were
                at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having
                fun.

     ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the
     room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an
     unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared
     with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.

                          KASIMOV
                I don't even know how I got here.
                I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I
                didn't lay a finger on her.

     ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.

                          ANATOLY
                Kasimov.  Don't flounder.

     IN THE CLOSET

     JACK, impatient, checks his watch. 

                          JACK 
                Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come 
                on, come on! 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          KASIMOV 
                You're the only one who can help me. 

     Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits 
     his hand away and smacks him around the head. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     JACK reacts. 

     ON THE SCREEN

     ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY 
                C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. 

                          KASIMOV 
                They'll kill me. 

     ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY 
                You asked for my help.  You asked for my
                help...come on... 

                          KASIMOV
                You're right, of course. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     JACK leans forward. 

                          JACK 
                The name pal...give us the name. 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          KASIMOV 
                The contact in Minsk..the contact in 
                Minsk..works in a travel agency. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

                          JACK 
                Come on! 

     ON THE SCREEN 

                          ANATOLY 
                Come on! 

                          KASIMOV 
                His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. 

                          ANATOLY 
                Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... 

     IN THE CLOSET 

                          JACK 
                Got him. 

     ON THE SCREEN 

     Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder
     as if he had just anointed him. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross 
     checks -- "MIEDIEV" comes up, then "posting/American 
     consulate/Kiev." 

     JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in 
     the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic 
     and virtually no bottom.  She quickly leaves. 

     INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT

     We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. 
     She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot 
     glasses. 

                          ANATOLY 
                Now, we drink. 

     He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. 

                          ANATOLY (CONT'D) 
                To friends. 

                          KASIMOV 
                Yes, Anatoly, yes. 

                          JACK 
                Cheers. 

     He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. 
     Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY 
     moves to the closet door and opens it. 

     IN THE CLOSET 

     ANATOLY reaches up to his face --

     --and tears away a mask of flesh.  He's no middle aged 
     Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early 
     thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands 
     ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the 
     room. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (in English now) 
                Get rid of this scum. 

     Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO 
     OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. 

     ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks 
     the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He 
     strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the 
     dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a 
     stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. 

     CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half 
     rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her 
     mouth. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Did we get it? 

                          ETHAN 
                We got it.  On your feet. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. 

                          ETHAN 
                Walk, just walk.  Start walking. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm walking. 

                          ETHAN 
                Talking's good, walking's better. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Sleeping's better. 

     Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling 
     lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to 
     come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set 
     in the middle of an empty warehouse. 

     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him 
     questioningly. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Are you all right Ethan.  What's wrong
                with you? 

                          ETHAN 
                If you're gonna do this again Claire, 
                It's not gonna be on my watch. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Oh yeah? 

     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, 
     questioningly. 

                          JACK 
                Claire. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack. 

     She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her 
     finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at 
     large. 

                          ETHAN
                IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT 
                OUT OF HERE YET?! 

                          JACK 
                Just waiting for you, tubs. 

     He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, 
     clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding 
     ring. 

     We move in on it --

                                                            CUT TO: 

     INT. JET - DAY

     -- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's 
     finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the 
     plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves 
     some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a 
     fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. 

     The pilot's voice makes an announcement. 

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off 
                at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight 
                thousand feet-and we should be arriving 
                in Prague right on schedule. 

     A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing 
     out menus. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 

     A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                          (CONT'D) 
                Would you like to watch a movie Mr 
                Phelps? 

     The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his 
     mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and 
     not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the 
     ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. 

                          PHELPS 
                No, I prefer the theatre.  

     A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes 
     stilted. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you consider the cinema of the
                Ukraine? 

                          PHELPS 
                Perhaps you'd choose one for me. 

     The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes 
     a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the 
     armrest. 

     AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.

     The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 
     cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of 
     the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. 

     BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT

     The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. 
     He takes it without a word and she moves on. 

     PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between 
     his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small 
     movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the 
     other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the 
     armrest, and puts the tape in. 

     He presses play.

     ON THE TAPE, 

     the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, 
     but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed 
     glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than 
     tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever 
     look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (on the tape) 
                Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're 
                about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 

     The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man 
     in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, 
     presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks 
     down a foreign street. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                -- a former KGB Line X officer now 
                working the international black market 
                selling intelligence.  This morning, we 
                learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half 
                of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- 
                official cover agents working in Eastern 
                Europe. 

     The screen shows an image of what such a list might look 
     like, code names and other information scrolling by on a 
     computer screen at high speed. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                For security reasons, the NOC list is 
                divided into two encoded halves. 
                Golitsyn already has the cryptonym 
                portion, which contains agent code names 
                and targeting areas.  This portion is 
                useless unless combined with the second 
                half -- the true name list that is kept 
                in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 

     The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building 
     at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava 
     River. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the 
                true name list at an Embassy function 
                tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you 
                decide to accept it, is to obtain 
                photographic proof of the theft, apprehend 
                those involved, and return the stolen 
                list.  I don't have to stress the 
                importance of this matter, Jim.  We're 
                keeping it internally black. Because of  
                its urgency, I've already sent to Prague 
                a team selected from your usual group. 

     Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already 
     seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                Ethan Hunt will of course be your point 
                man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're 
                getting word to him now. 

     INT. JET - DAY

     PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his 
     tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. 

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) 
                As always, should you or any member of 
                your IM force be caught or killed, the 
                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.  This tape will self- 
                destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, 
                Jim! 

     PHELPS inhales deeply -- 

     -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a 
     plume of wispy smoke -- 

     -- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of 
     cigarette smoke. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY

     SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. 
     Another legend: 

                         PRAGUE 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY 

     The IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague 
     apartment with a panoramic view of the city. 

     The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, 
     overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. 
     JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating 
     the VISCO glasses to her.  CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at 
     the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH 
     taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. 

                          JACK 
                Look to your right, then back to me. 
                There's a camera built right into the 
                bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and 
                transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

                          SARAH 
                Of course I can hear you. 

                          JACK 
                No, in your...ear piece. You have a 
                lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me 
                now? 

                          SARAH 
                Loud and clear. 

                          JACK 
                What's going on? 

                          SARAH 
                I don't know. 

                          JACK 
                Why don't you take a look? 

                          SARAH 
                Jack...that's spying. 

                          JACK 
                That's what we do isn't it? 

                          SARAH 
                Jack you're so wicked. 

                          JACK 
                Too wicked to have a drink later? 

                          SARAH 
                I think I might just take that look. 

     ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more 
                than ninety days leave coming. 

                          PHELPS 
                A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. 
                Take it all, if you want.  After this one. 

                          ETHAN 
                I thought I'd take some now. 

                          PHELPS
                     (quietly, to Ethan) 
                What the hell's made you decide to take 
                your leave at the worst possible time? 
                Claire's in a weird mood too. 

                          ETHAN 
                Oh?  What's the problem? 

                          PHELPS 
                I don't know, I had to go to Chicago 
                again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me. 

                          ETHAN 
                Tell you what? 

                          PHELPS 
                When you started noticing your short term 
                memory loss.  What the problem was you 
                and Claire had in Kiev? 

                          ETHAN 
                What problem? 

                          PHELPS
                     (laughs)
                Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking
                burnout here?

                          ETHAN 
                I guess. 

                          PHELPS 
                Ethan, you can't burn out. 

                          ETHAN
                Why not? 

                          PHELPS 
                Because I can't afford it. And because 
                you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

     CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to 
     be the reference point in the following exchange: 

                          ETHAN 
                How was Chicago? 

                          PHELPS 
                Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto 
                dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the 
                one about the astronaut who comes back 
                from the first manned flight to Mars 
                after two years?  His wife's got a year 
                old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was 
                it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,
                it was my friend Sammy."  She says it 
                wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my 
                friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, 
                don't you think I have any friends of my 
                own?!" 

     PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is 
     in his line of sight. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                Boy, you really are grim. Come here, 
                take a look. 

     He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. 

     EXT. PRAGUE - DAY

     ETHAN nods. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                Beyond Charles Bridge there is our 
                Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if 
                anything goes wrong, this guy will steal 
                the names of our agents in every country 
                all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to 
                the highest bidders -- third world 
                terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 
                any and everybody who'd love to get rid 
                of long term coverts like us, and some 
                very dear friends among them.  If they're 
                exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over 
                here.  Take a lock at this. 

     CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a 
     quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old 
     edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is 
     playing. 

     ETHAN is distracted by it. 

     INSERT - TELEVISION

     SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, 
     is holding forth: 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA 
                and all its shadow organizations have 
                become irrelevant at best and 
                unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we 
                throw a little light on the whole concept 
                of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These 
                covert agency subgroups have confidential 
                funding, they report to no one -- who are
                these people?!  We were living in a 
                democracy the last time I checked. 

     BACK TO SCENE 

     ETHAN looks back at JIM. 

                          ETHAN 
                You're going to use Walter? 

                          PHELPS 
                He's our guy. 

                          ETHAN 
                Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? 

                          PHELPS 
                Not this week. This week he's flyfishing 
                at the Oughterard Slough in County 
                Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. 

                          ETHAN
                He won't be back in a hurry? 

                          PHELPS 
                No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? 
                You think the plot'll work? 

                          ETHAN 
                Sure.  If the main character does. 

                          PHELPS 
                If you were me, Ethan, who would you
                trust to make him believable? 

     JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum.

                          JACK 
                Sorry, am I interrupting?  

                          ETHAN
                Always. 

     JACK shows the gum to ETHAN.

                          JACK 
                Stick of gum. If you come up against a 
                lock you can't pick -- 

     Half the gum is red, the other half is green. 

                          JACK (CONT'D) 
                Red light.  Green light.  Mash them 
                together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on 
                you -- you have five seconds. 

     He offers the gum to ETHAN.

                          PHELPS 
                Are you gonna take it? 

     CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. 
     PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (relenting) 
                Give me the God damn gum. 

                          JACK 
                Just don't chew it. 

                          PHELPS 
                Thank you. 

                                                            CUT TO: 

     EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

     The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party 
     at the Embassy tonight. 

     INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking 
     eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator 
     shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks 
     up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's 
     looking for -- 

     -- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching 
     the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The 
     monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside 
     of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of 
     the elevator shaft. 

     PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. 

                          PHELPS 
                Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by 
                twenty-three hundred. 

     INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair 
     that's in full swing on the second floor. 

     SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand 
     staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo 
     hurries up to him. 

                          DIPLOMAT 
                How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, 
                the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just 
                steer you through the reception line here
                --

     The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a 
     reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. 

                          DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) 
                Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the 
                director of the National Gallery -- Petr 
                Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- 

     SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant 
     gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with 
     WALTZER. 

                          SARAH 
                I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                Of course I do.  How are you, Miss 
                Norman? 

     He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so 
     SARAH whispers something in his ear. 

                          SARAH 
                He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 

     Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 

     The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket 
     (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this 
     confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. 

     UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, 

     ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from 
     outside. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through 
     the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks 
     into his microphone. 

                          PHELPS 
                Sarah, mark the package and go to two. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

     SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. 

                          SARAH 
                Your advance team mentioned you'd want a 
                tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead 
                and set that up for you -- 

                          SENATOR WALTZER 
                Terrific.  Let's get going. 
                     (to the Diplomat) 
                Will you excuse us?  

     He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the 
     party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads 
     further into the Embassy. 

                          DIPLOMAT 
                Uh, sir? 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT                               

     JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal 
     box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a 
     noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above 
     him descending. 

     JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The 
     elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him 
     to the wall. 

                          JACK 
                Great.  Come on. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 

     As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, 
     SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as 
     she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing 
     herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never 
     notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT     

     JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks 
     to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy 
     one, as someone hurrying up stairs. 

                          PHELPS 
                Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

     On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and 
     slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. 

                          HANNAH 
                En route. 

     She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the 
     party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her 
     glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the 
     lenses. 

                          PHELPS (O/S) 
                Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to
                night vision). 

     HANNAHíS VISCO POV 

     the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands 
     out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green 
     where SARAH sprayed it. 

     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

     The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down 
     the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- 
     Political Attaches Only."  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. 

     He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an 
     elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it 
     says "Out of Order."  They head for it anyway. 

     A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them 
     by surprise.  

                          JACK 
                Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. 

                          GUARD 
                Excuse me, can I help you? 

                          SARAH 
                -- which leads directly to the Denied 
                Area, the only limited access area in the 
                whole facility. 

     SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. 

                          SARAH (CONT'D) 
                As you can see. this area has both a 
                Marine guard and video surveillance, and 
                is strictly monitored at all times. 

     She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank 
     and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes 
     a message -- "ACCESS DENIED."  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. 

                          SARAH (CONT'D)
                     (covering) 
                Senator, don't you have a young man on 
                your staff named JACK? 

     She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack?  I believe we did have a young man 
                named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I 
                recall.  Constantly late or behind in his 
                work. 

     Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed 
     access, comes closer to them. 

                          GUARD 
                Excuse me, let me see that ID again! 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening 
     to their conversation. 

                          PHELPS (O.S.) 
                Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a 
                second.  Keep dancing.  

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                     (with the Senator's southern accent) 
                We were forced to tie him to my best 
                stallion and drag him around the barn a 
                few times.  

     Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. 

                          JACK 
                Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on
                it. 

     He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of 
     circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the 
     elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.

     THE LAPTOP

     there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID 
     picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. 

     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

     Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the 
     thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time 
     the message flashes -- 

                          IDENTITY CONFIRMED 

     -- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  

     The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR. 

                          GUARD 
                Oh. Sorry, sir. 

     He snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and 
     the doors close behind them. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     JACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he 
     can see them inside. 

                          JACK 
                The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely
                off. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's 
     view of the party on his video monitors. 

                          PHELPS 
                     (a touch of impatience) 
                Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. 

     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

     HANNAH, stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves 
     to get a better view of the party. She reacquires GOLITSYN's 
     glowing head.  

                          HANNAH 
                He's heading to the denied area. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     This work room is filled with combination lock filing 
     cabinets and various computer terminals.  ETHAN hands SARAH 
     his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them 
     upside down on top of a filing cabinet.  

     ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, 
     switching several times. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to Sarah) 
                Higher.  Higher.  

                          SARAH 
                Higher. 

                          ETHAN 
                Right, right.  Good. 

     SARAH adjusts the glasses. 

     THROUGH THE GLASSES, 

     the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but 
     clear.  Anyone sitting there will be recorded. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     On PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on 
     the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer.  PHELPS 
     barks out a warning.  

                          PHELPS 
                Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     ETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already 
     moving up. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack we're in position. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall 
     simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the 
     rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are 
     waiting for it to arrive. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jack.  Jack. 

                          JACK 
                I didn't touch it. 

     The elevator stops, the doors open -- 

     -- and GOLITSYN gets on.  GOLITSYN descends in the elevator 
     with JACK on top and ETHAN and SARAH waiting down below! 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with 
     GOLITSYN inside.  

                          PHELPS 
                     (tension rising) 
                He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one 
     GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a 
     place to hide. 

                          ETHAN 
                OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open
                the doors. 

                          SARAH 
                What about my coat?  I'll freeze. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                I don't have it. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

     PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. 

                          PHELPS 
                Opening the doors.  Go under. 

     He jabs ENTER on his keyboard. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft 
     beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space 
     below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator 
     continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator 
     drops to just over their heads and stops. 

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides 
     a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. 
     Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, 
     downloading the vital information. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, 
     starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as 
     GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a 
     microphone.  

                          ETHAN 
                He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                Give me a break, Pops. 

                          SARAH 
                Such a nice ass. 

                          JACK (O.S.) 
                And a lonely ass. 

                          ETHAN 
                Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport 
                in five minutes. 

                          CLAIRE (O.S.) 
                Roger that. 

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now 
     reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base 
     of the elevator shaft. 

     EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the 
     final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes 
     and SPARKS. 

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the 
     waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous 
     couple. 

                          ETHAN
                In position.  Jack open the door, let the
                package roll.

                          JACK (O.S.)
                Roger that.  Opening doors now.

                          ETHAN
                Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to
                transport.

     ETHANíS voice comes over HANNAHíS earpiece.

                          HANNAH
                En route.

     HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     The button marked "ROOF" lights up, seemingly all by itself.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     The car engages with a sharp jolt --

                          JACK
                Hey.

     --and starts to rise.  JACK looks down, into the elevator
     car, through the grate.  Thereís no one in it.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     On one of his monitors, PHELPS sees the elevator moving in
     the shaft.

                          PHELPS
                Jack, what are you doing?!

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

                          JACK
                Iím not doing anything!  (I donít have it
                either).

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button
     but gets no response.

                          PHELPS
                I donít have it -- I donít have
                control!

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     JACKíS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the
     approaching ceiling.

                          JACK
                Uh -- then I have a problem.

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     GOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer,
     slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     JACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching
     roof, covered with spikes.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACKíS P.O.V. of the roof of
     the building approaching.  Fast.

                          ETHAN
                Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do
                you hear me.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT

     On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control
     panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get
     the thing to stop.

     He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster.
     He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him.
        
                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                Come on, Jack, come on.

     JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his
     hands, he SCREAMS --

     --and heís crushed to death against the roof.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was
     JACKíS signal.

                          ETHAN
                Jack.  Jack.

     He closes his eyes, knowing what that means.

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS also sees the static.

                          PHELPS
                Man down.  Stay where you are.  Iím on my
                way.

     He gets up and races out of the apartment.

     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT

     GOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the
     elevator button but it wonít even light up.  He studies the
     elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and
     SARAH did moments before.

     He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small
     door at the shaftís base.

     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     PHELPS hurries towards the bridge.

                          PHELPS
                En route.

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

     PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the
     river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his
     shoulder.  Paranoiaís setting in.

     EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT

     Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the
     service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in
     the midst of a loverís quarrel, in Russian.

     Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is
     still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if
     hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening
     gloom.

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELPíS voice over the monitor.

                          SARAH
                The package is in the open.

                          ETHAN
                Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Iíve got a shadow.

                          ETHAN
                Can you lose him?

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                No.  Abort.

     Over ETHANís shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.  Fog
     starts to roll over the river towards the bridge.

                          SARAH
                Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.                

                          ETHAN
                     (to Phelps) 
                Jim we canít.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Abort.  Thatís an order.

                          ETHAN
                Negative, Golitsynís on the move.

     INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT

     Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN
     argue.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!

     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT

     Outside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue.

                          ETHAN
                Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím
                coming to you.

                          SARAH
                Jim gave an abort, we should walk
                away.

                          ETHAN
                No, weíre going to recover the disk,
                understand?!  Now move!

     ETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow
     GOLITSYN.

     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

     HANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle.

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Where are you?

                          ETHAN
                About two hundred yards from the bridge.

                          PHELPS (O.S.)
                Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan.
                Cut all radio communications.  Repeat.
                Cut all radio communications.  

     ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past
     CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor
     and again sees PHELPSí POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is
     looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

     SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where
     a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears
     into the fog at the edge of the river.

     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

     ETHAN checks his monitor again.

     THE MONITOR

     PHELPSí point of view changes radically as his head swivels
     on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his
     shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,
     pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a
     GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.

     The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down
     to a bloody hole in his own chest.

     His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge
     and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.
        
     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

     ETHANís face goes white with shock.

                          ETHAN
                JIM!

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT

     He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereís
     no sign of PHELPS.

     ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but
     sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming
     obscured in the gathering fog.

     He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see
     GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.

     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

     ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point
     on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIREíS outline,
     visible in the driverís seat.  But as he descends the stairs
     --

     --the car explodes and bursts into flames.

     The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.

                          ETHAN
                CLAIRE!

     He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a 
     stunned CROWD starts to gather.

     Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the
     embankment.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

     SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
     GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an
     seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.

     SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to
     be hanging with her for some reason.

     EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT

     ETHAN continues towards the embankment.

     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

     SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of
     GOLITSYN pulls him towards him.  Sensing something wrong,
     SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over
     GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYNís
     pockets.

     The figure finds what itís looking for -- the disk -- and
     takes it.  SARAH comes closer --

     -- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,
     plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.

     ANGLE

     ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts
     out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,
     over GOLITSYNís body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and
     GASPS.

     He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He
     looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated
     edge.

     BEHIND ETHAN

     The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, theyíre
     watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him
     leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.

     AT THE BODIES

     SARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body
     over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins
     rummaging through his pockets.

     ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...

     ANGLE

     A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in
     front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop
     suddenly.

     As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the
     explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley
     and out of sight.

     EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

     ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  Heís
     holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a 
     modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts
     of the phoneís wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.

     He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneís tongue
     down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial
     tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
     heart.

     After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Satcom seven.

                          ETHAN
                Central Europe.  Unsecured.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Designator?

                          ETHAN
                Bravo Echo one one.

                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)
                Switching.

     There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the
     line.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                This is Kittridge.

                          ETHAN
                Go secure.

     Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.      
        
                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Go ahead.

                          ETHAN
                Theyíre dead.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Whoís dead?

                          ETHAN
                My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -
                - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
        
                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Are you damaged?

                          ETHAN
                They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís
                dead too.  The disk is gone.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Are you intact?

                          ETHAN
                Do you read me?  The list is in the open!

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Let's just bring you in safely, and then
                we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you
                followed?

     ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGEíS voice is strong and
     reassuring and he needs that right now.

                          ETHAN
                I donít think so.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Donít think, be sure.  Are you clean?

                          ETHAN
                Yes.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there
                myself.

                          ETHAN
                Youíre in Prague?

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít
                disappoint me.

                          ETHAN
                No sir.

                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)
                One hour.

     He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone
     for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the
     street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every
     sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his
     hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.

     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

     ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,
     gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by 
     residential buildings.

     ETHANíS POV

     Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built
     on the portico of an old palace.

     Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively
     shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.

     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     ETHAN'S POV 

     ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an 
     enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. 
     He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are 
     scattered around. 

     EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and 
     ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple 
     of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he 
     goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized 
     lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit. 
                          
                          KITTRIDGE 
                I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know 
                how much Jim in particular meant to you, 
                Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah. 

     He spots a stack of documents on the table.

     ETHAN picks them up.  There's a Canadian picture bearing 
     ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, 
     driver's license, etc. 

                          KITTRIDGE
                Passport, visas - you know the drill. 
                We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, 
                debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague 
                police a bone, you know toss them a few 
                suspects.  Follow me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah.  I follow you. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                We've lost enough agents for one night. 

                          ETHAN 
                You mean I've lost enough agents for one 
                night. 

     KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, 
     carefully: 
        
                          KITTRIDGE 
                You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 
                Ethan. 

                          ETHAN 
                Who else is left? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Yes.  I see your point. 

                          ETHAN 
                Why was there another team? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                What? 

                          ETHAN 
                Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I don't quite follow you. 

                          ETHAN
                Let's see if you can follow me around 
                this room. 
                     (eyes moving around the room) 
                The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 
                and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing 
                around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. 
                The waiter behind Hannah at the top of 
                the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The 
                other IMF team.  You're worried about me. 
                Why?

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (a tight little smile) 
                You're right.  Maybe this'll save some 
                time. 

     The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE 
     tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out 
     of his jacket. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                For a little over two years now we've 
                been spotting serious blowback in IMF 
                operations.  We have a penetration.  The 
                other day we decoded a message on the 
                Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

                          ETHAN 
                The arms dealer. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                That's right.  Max, it seems, has two 
                unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
                and for corrupting susceptible agents. 
                This time he's gotten to someone on the 
                inside - he's put himself in a position 
                to buy our NOC list. An operation he 
                referred to as "Job 314".  The job he 
                thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. 

                          ETHAN 
                But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Correct the actual list is safe at 
                Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 
                one of ours. 

                          ETHAN 
                This whole operation was a molehunt. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like 
                you said.  You survived. 

     ETHAN stares at him levelly. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)
                I want to show you something, Ethan. 

     He now shoves the papers across the table.  They're xeroxed 
     copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and 
     MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                Since your father's death, your family's 
                farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, 
                suddenly, they're flush with over a 
                hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 
                Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 
                out the bank account -- dying slowly in 
                America after all, can be a very 
                expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why 
                don't we go quietly out of here onto the 
                plane... 

                          ETHAN 
                How about if we just go quietly into the 
                bathroom and I wash your mouth out with 
                soap - you pathetic button down 
                bureaucratic asshole. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                Ethan, I can understand you're very 
                upset. 

                          ETHAN 
                Kitteridge, you've never seen me very 
                upset. 

        ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While 
        KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've 
                bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 
                intimate loyalties to get away with it. 
                You're determined to shake hands with the 
                devil and I'm going to make sure you do 
                it in hell. 

     We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of 
     bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, 
     mushing the two sides together. 

     ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the
     table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of 
     gum. 

     Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine 
     glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- 

     -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes 
     widen.  KA BOOM! 

     The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish 
     tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and 
     WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. 

     At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. 

     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

     ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the 
     deserted square. 

     EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

     Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs 
     illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, 
     then puts his jacket back on. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

     ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and 
     scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the 
     next bulb. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT

     At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft 
     sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments 
     dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 

     In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with 
     flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a 
     Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking 
     them as he goes. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

     ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, 
     pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He 
     unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various 
     denominations from various countries and a couple of 
     passports. 

     As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the
     mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water 
     and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

     He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he 
     notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the 
     static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by 
     one, he switches them off. 

     THE LAPTOP 

     JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN 
     wakes it up. 
        
     The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its 
     connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: 

                SELECT USENET GROUP

     ETHAN TYPES IN 

                job 314

                          ETHAN
                Job.  Job 3:14.  March fourteen.  Job 31 
                March. 

     The computer replies: 

                SEARCHING STRING NOT FOUND

     ETHAN tries again: 

                max.com

     The answer: 

                SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND

     He tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," 
     but nothing comes up.  He tries something else -- "scroll 
     usenet groups."  

     The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying 
     speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. 

     ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to 
     figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the 
     others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES. 

                          ETHAN 
                Job three fourteen.  Job --
                     (a realization, 
                     the Biblical pronunciation) 
                It's Job! 

     He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and 
     finds a Gideon Bible.  He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the 
     Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors..." 

     He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the 
     Internet and under the command "Select Usenet Group" he 
     types: 

                BIBLE

     The computer replies:

     ETHAN:

     The computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious 
     icons and artwork with an accompanying message: 

                WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF JOB DISCUSSION 
 GROUP. WHICH CHAPTER AND VERSE DO                 YOU WISH TO POST YOUR ENTRY UNDER?

     ETHAN types his answer "Job 3:14" and the screen presents a 
     "stickie" for him to write his message on.  He does: 

                          ETHAN

                hazardous.  DO NOT USE.  Fate will be

     ANGLE

     A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other 
     side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, 
     his middle a hopelessly bloody mess.  He looks like he's 
     dying on his feet.  ETHAN freezes, appalled. 

                          PHELPS
                Ethan, what are you doing? 

     ETHAN tries to speak but nothing will come out. 

                          PHELPS (CONT'D) 
                I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the 
                bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan? 
                Ethan? 

     ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. 
     PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from 
     the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked 
     and pointed at -- 

     ANGLE

     It's CLAIRE. 

                          ETHAN 
                What are you doing here?! 

     CLAIRE freezes, her hands half-raised. 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (carefully) 
                Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. 
                Ethan what's wrong with you? 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't move. 

     Her right hand has moved a fraction.  She freezes again. 

                          ETHAN 
                You were in the car! 

                          CLAIRE 
                I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in 
                trouble on the radio.  He said someone 
                was... 

                          ETHAN 
                Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the 
                car. 

                          CLAIRE 
                No, I got out of the car and I ran to the
                bridge. 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What happened to Jim? 

                          ETHAN 
                There was nobody on the bridge. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What happened to Jim? 

     Ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. 

                          ETHAN 
                Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire! 
                Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all 
                dead! 

     ETHAN releases her wrists. 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (mumbling) 
                They're dead.  Jim's dead. 

                          ETHAN
                Take off your coat. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What? 

                          ETHAN 
                Take off your God damn coat! 

     He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- 
     spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead 
     body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. 

     CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand 
     cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S 
     shivering. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                Where were you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                I walked away.  He said abort.  He was 
                gone so I walked away. 

                          ETHAN 
                That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? 
                Did they send you here? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (slowly) 
                Who is "they?" 

                          ETHAN 
                Did they send you...Did they send you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Who is they, who is they? 

        ETHAN grabs her by the wrists. 

                          ETHAN 
                Who sent you?!  Who sent you? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (screaming) 
                No one sent me!  We're supposed to be 
                back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, 
                if we abort, we don't return here until 
                four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, 
                four o'clock --! 

     She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, 
     BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN 
     releases his grip on her wrists. 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

     ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, 
     still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of 
     the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Why haven't they brought us in yet? 

                          ETHAN
                I've been disavowed.  They think I killed 
                Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred 
                thousand dollars found its way into my 
                parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes 
                I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've 
                been in the employ of an arms dealer, 
                Max, for the last two years, to get him 
                our NOC list. 

     A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What are you going to do? 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the 
                mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, 
                at least part of the time. 1 can't find 
                him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, 
                he'll find me. 
                
                          CLAIRE 
                Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me 
                go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going 
                to tell him you had nothing to do... 

                          ETHAN
                Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not 
                dead, he's going to assume you're with 
                me. 

     The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. 

     THE COMPUTER SCREEN

     Blinking -- "MESSAGE WAITING."  ETHAN hurries over and clicks 
     on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows 
     up: 

     ?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. 

 ? BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL 
 ? AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS 
     ?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH

     CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. 

                          CLAIRE 
                The message is for Job. 

                          ETHAN
                I'm going to answer it. 

     EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY

     ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A 
     MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to 
     ETHAN. 

                          ETHAN 
                Excuse me, could I trouble you for a 
                match? 

     Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As 
     ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm 
     and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. 

     INT. CAR - DAY

     ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. 
     MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He 
     extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. 

                          MATTHIAS
                Would you remove your hat please? 

                          ETHAN 
                Why? 

                          MATTHIAS 
                You wish to meet Max?  This is the price 
                of admission. 

     Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car 
     takes off. 

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting 
     upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in 
     the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are 
     drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- 
     expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 

     Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few 
     seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone 
     is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. 

                          ETHAN
                I thought I was going to see Max. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. 

                          ETHAN 
                Then what am I doing here? 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Allowing Max to see you and hear what 
                you've got to say. 

                          ETHAN 
                I don't communicate very well through a 
                shroud. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                If Max doesn't like what you have to say, 
                you'll be wearing that shroud 
                indefinitely. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm willing to take the chance. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Very well. 

     MAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. 
     When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall 
     woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of 
     severity. 

                          MAX 
                Who are you and what are you doing here? 
                          
                          ETHAN 
                I need one hundred thousand dollars. 

                          MAX
                Really?  And you thought if you simply 
                showed up I might give it to you? 

                          ETHAN 
                Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and 
                twenty five thousand. 

                          MAX 
                The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, 
                Job is not given to quoting Scripture in 
                his communications. And there was its 
                tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is 
                not playful.  So you're something of a 
                paradox. 

                          ETHAN 
                That depends. 

                          MAX
                On what? 

                          ETHAN 
                Whether you like a paradox.  I want a 
                hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

                          MAX
                It's quite out of the question. 

                          ETHAN 
                The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's 
                bait, part of an internal molehunt. 

                          MAX
                And how might you know that?  Are you 
                another Company man? 

                          ETHAN 
                Like Job? 

                          MAX 
                Ah, but, we're asking about you. 

                          ETHAN
                I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. 

                          MAX 
                Why, may I ask? 

                          ETHAN
                That's the question I want to ask Job. 

                          MAX 
                I don't know Job any more than he knows 
                me. 

                          ETHAN 
                Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an 
                introduction. 

                          MAX 
                Why should I? 

                          ETHAN 
                Because I can deliver the actual NOC 
                list.  The one you have is not only 
                worthless, it's certain to be equipped 
                with a homing device to pinpoint your 
                exact location. 

                          MAX 
                It's easy to say the disk is worthless 
                when you say I can't look at the 
                information and see if it's worthless. 
                Not a tenable position, sir. 

                          ETHAN 
                Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from 
                thirty seconds to ten minutes you're 
                gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping 
                around you like jackrabbits. 

                          MAX 
                     (Pause.) 
                Mm - Hmmm... 

                          ETHAN
                Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner 
                you used in the car? 

                          MAX 
                Very good. 

                          ETHAN 
                Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up 
                first. 

     ANGLE

     MATTHIAS boots up.  There's a little musical noise and the 
     screen brightens.  The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a 
     complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other 
     personal information scrolls by.  But Matthias is watching 
     the digital read-out on the RF scanner. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so 
                good. 

                          MAX 
                That's not so good for you, my friend. 

     On the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Thirty-two and change. 

                          MAX 
                     (to Ethan) 
                Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just 
                be the hard drive heating up. 

     She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to 
     make up her mind about something. 

                          MATTHIAS 
                Forty-four.  Forty-five. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'd say you've got about two minutes. 

     MAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows -- 

     --nothing happens. He opens the French doors that lead out 
     onto a balcony. 

     EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY

     The OTHER MAN comes out on the balcony.  Nothing out here but 
     a beautiful day.  He walks to the railing and looks down at 
     the street. 

     Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street 
     sign.  WOOF.  WOOF.  WOOF.  Abruptly, it stops. 

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 

     Back inside: 

                          MATTHIAS
                Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. 

     EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT

     A pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street 
     activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi 
     as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the 
     van. 

     INT. MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

     Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined 
     trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit 
     the stairs. They climb them silently. 

     INT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

     A CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the 
     AGENTS come up the stairs, guns drawn. Her jaw drops and she 
     turns off the vacuum cleaner. 

                          FEMALE IMF 
                     (in czech) 
                Switch it on.  Keep cleaning. 

     KITTRIDGE looks at her sharply and gestures.  She turns the 
     vacuum back on. They reach the door of a certain apartment 
     and -- 

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     -- KICK through it.  The AGENTS swarm into MAX'S apartment, 
     guns waving in all directions.  KITTRIDGE sweeps in between 
     them and takes command of the place -- 

     --but there's nobody here.  TWO AGENTS race into the bedroom, 
     and just as quickly out again. 

     EXT. POWDER TOWER - TOP SHOT - DAY

     MAX, ETHAN, MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN move quickly across 
     the bridge that connects Max's apartment to the tower. 

     EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT BALCONY - DAY

     KITTRIDGE kicks open the door to the balcony, comes outside, 
     and looks around.  Nobody in sight. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                GOD D- 

     INT. MAX'S CAR - ETHAN AND MAX - DAY 

                          MAX 
                Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use 
                one of his apartments again. 
                     (turns to Ethan) 
                Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. 
                You're a good sport.  Do accept the 
                compliment. 

                          ETHAN 
                Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine? 

     INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY 

                          MAX
                I don't have to tell you what a comfort 
                anonymity can be in my profession -- like 
                a warm blanket. 
                     (abruptly) 
                My deal with Job was subject to a 
                successful boot scan.  Obviously it 
                didn't pass muster.  Deal's off. 

                          ETHAN 
                What was your deal with Job? 

                          MAX 
                Six million dollars.  I'll give you the 
                same.  But I want the complete list now, 
                not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this 
                piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want 
                the entire list, the true name of every 
                non-official cover agent throughout the 
                world. 

                          ETHAN 
                Ten million.  Ten million in negotiable 
                U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer 
                form, coupons attached.  And one more 
                thing -- your personal assurance that Job 
                will be at the exchange. 

                          MAX 
                Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want 
                it by the end of the week. 

                          ETHAN
                How will you make sure Job will be there? 

                          MAX
                How will you make sure I'll have the list 
                in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now 
                where can I drop you dear boy? 

                          ETHAN 
                I'm not being dropped anywhere without my 
                money. 

     MAX manages to laugh without coughing.  Then, with an 
     admonishing forefinger: 

                          MAX 
                I'm going to have to front you 
                personally.  Don't lose that money 
                without losing your life. 

                          ETHAN 
                I wouldn't dream of it. 

     MAX settles back and regards ETHAN.  A theatrical sigh.  She 
     fancies this guy. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY

     KITTRIDGE waits on the balcony for his AGENTS to complete 
     their search.  HARRY BARNES, a middle-aged, gray suited, 
     somewhat gray-faced bureaucrat, comes to join Kittridge. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under 
                until he decides to surface. 

                          BARNES 
                Look we can use someone from the Embassy 
                and we can get the local authorities 
                involved. Close off his transportation. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the 
                airport?  How many identities do you 
                think Hunt has?  How many times has he 
                slipped past custom, in how many 
                countries?  These guys are trained to be 
                ghosts.  We taught them how to do it, for 
                Christ's sake! 

                          BARNES 
                So what do you suggest? 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make 
                him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure 
                points.  Find out something that's 
                important to him personally and you 
                squeeze. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

     ETHAN enters the living room.  CLAIRE walks out of the 
     bedroom holding a gun. 

     ETHAN reaches into his jacket and holds up a hefty wad of 
     currency. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Max made a deal with you? 

                          ETHAN
                I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. 

                          CLAIRE 
                We've got seventy-five rounds for your 
                Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig 
                Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with 
                monitor, plenty of passports. You said 
                it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with 
                you. 

                          ETHAN 
                You're sure about this? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Jim was my husband. I want to know who 
                killed him. ( ALT ) I want to get the son 
                of a bitch who did this. 

                          ETHAN
                We need help, and we don't have time. 
                They have to be local. 

                          CLAIRE 
                What kind of help? 

     INT. SAFE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

     The KY57 crypto phone, a black box with an ordinary phone 
     receiver in the top, THUNKS down on the table. 

     ETHAN plugs the phone cable from his laptop into the back. 
     The green display on top of the KY57 dials a number and makes 
     a computer connection. 

     On the computer, the screen says: 

                I.M.F. PERSONNEL DATABASE 
                ENTER PASSWORD NOW

     ETHAN types a password and the screen asks him for the 

                CATEGORY?

     He types in a single word. 

                DISAVOWED

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. TRAIN - STATEROOM - NIGHT
        
     The word "disavowed" dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a 
     high speed train, where the newly assembled IM force has 
     gathered around a table -- KRIEGER, a dangerous-looking 
     Frenchman of forty or so, LUTHER STICKELL, a muscular, soft- 
     spoken American in his mid-thirties.  ETHAN, and CLAIRE. 
     LUTHER regards the others warily. 

                          ETHAN
                Simple game.  Four players. 
                     (points to Krieger) 
                Exfil opens the pocket -- 
                     (and to Luther)
                -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Bank? 

                          ETHAN 
                IMF mainframe. 

                          KRIEGER 
                     (after a moment) 
                Where exactly is it? 

                          ETHAN 
                In Langley. 

                          LUTHER 
                In Langley?  The one in Virginia, Langley? 

                          KRIEGER 
                Inside CIA headquarters at Langley. 

     ETHAN nods.  KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE. 

                          KRIEGER (CONT'D) 
                Is he serious? 

                          CLAIRE 
                Always. 

                          KRIEGER 
                If we're going to Virginia, why don't we 
                drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a 
                helicopter right in through the lobby and  
                set it down inside the vault and it will 
                be a hell of a lot easier than breaking 
                into the God damn CIA. 

                          LUTHER 
                What are we downloading? 

                          ETHAN 
                Information. 

                          LUTHER 
                What kind? 

                          ETHAN 
                Profitable. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Payment on delivery. 

                          LUTHER 
                I don't know.  This I don't know. 

                          ETHAN
                This doesn't sound like the Luther 
                Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used 
                to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas 
                Phreak?  The only man alive who actually 
                hacked NATO Ghostcom. 

                          LUTHER 
                There was never any physical evidence 
                that I had anything to do with that.. 
                that.. 
                     (correcting himself) 
                With that exceptional piece of work. 

                          ETHAN 
                You don't know what you're missing. This 
                is the Mt. Everest of hacks. 

                          LUTHER 
                You're all kidding yourselves. Even with 
                top of the line crypto.  Cray access. 
                STU 3's -- 

                          CLAIRE 
                Krieger can get it. 
                     (to Krieger) 
                Right? 

                          KRIEGER 
                May take a little time. 

                          ETHAN
                May take a little time. That's not what 
                Claire tells me about you. 

                          LUTHER 
                Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking 
                about the 686 prototypes -- with the 
                artificial intelligence Risk chip -- 

     ETHAN looks at KRIEGER. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Twenty-four hours. 

     ETHAN looks back at LUTHER.  LUTHER thinks. 

                          LUTHER 
                And I get to keep the equipment when 
                we're done. 

                          ETHAN 
                Luther, I guess you're all out of 
                excuses.

                          LUTHER 
                I can't just hack my way inside.  There's 
                no modem access to the mainframe, it's in 
                a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically 
                at the terminal. 

                          ETHAN 
                Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. 
                The terminal's in black vault lock-down. 

     INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY

     While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: 

     A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file 
     folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters 
     building.  He comes to an impressive guard station and rests 
     his chin on a strange-looking optometric device. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                They missed nothing in that room.  Even 
                the vents have laser nets over them.  

     Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into 
     a "RESTRICTED" area of the building. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY

     The ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain 
     aside and comes to a large, vaulted door.  He slides a card- 
     key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key 
     into the slot beneath it. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.)
                Inside, there are three countermeasure 
                systems that can only be deactivated by 
                authorized entry.  Which we won't have. 

     A panel next to the ANALYST says "INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES 
     OFF."  The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, 
     CHUNKS the door open and steps into -- 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     -- the secured terminal room.  It's not large but it's 
     impressive.  A single terminal is bolted into the middle of 
     the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook 
     computer storage towers. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                The first system is sound-sensitive, 
                anything above a whisper sets it off. 
                The second system is on the floor and 
                pressure-sensitive --

     The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across 
     the room.  As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his 
     feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                --and the third detects any increase in 
                temperature.  Even the body heat of an 
                unauthorized person in the room will 
                trigger it. 

     A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 
     degrees.  The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the 
     computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. 

                          ETHAN (V.O.) 
                All three systems are state of the art. 
                
     The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  A drop of 
     condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it 
     makes contact, the floor panel lights up. 

     INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT

     The other team members gathered around the table look at 
     ETHAN skeptically. 

                          LUTHER 
                And you really think we can do this. 

     INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT 

     The middle of the night and the train is dark. The team 
     members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER 
     heads in one direction, ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other.

     ETHAN stops.  His attention is drawn to the car ahead. There 
     is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it. 

     ETHAN'S P.O.V. THRU WINDOW (INT. BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)

     Ethan sees the business car, a plush space for busy 
     executives to get some work done on the train. There are 
     laptops, cellular phones, desks that fold out in front of 
     spacious seats. 

     A FEMALE EXECUTIVE, forty or so, is seated at one of the 
     desks, typing away into her laptop. 

     INT. TRAIN - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     ETHAN knocks on the compartment door. 

                          ETHAN 
                May I come in? 

                          CLAIRE 
                     (wary but interested) 
                Sure... 

     INT. TRAIN - CLAIREíS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT                              

     ETHAN and CLAIRE enter, ETHAN closing the compartment door. 
     He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her. 
     She takes it, waits. 

                          ETHAN 
                It's cash. And a second passport. If 
                anything goes wrong when we're inside, if 
                you sense even the slightest deviation 
                don't look over your shoulder, you walk 
                away - you hear me? Just walk away. 

                          CLAIRE 
                You don't think we're going to make it. 

                          ETHAN 
                I didn't say that. 

                          CLAIRE 
                You didn't have to......... 

                          ETHAN
                I just need you to be safe. 

                          CLAIRE
                What about you? 

                          ETHAN
                What about me - Jim called an abort - I 
                didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just 
                need you to be safe. 

     CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to 
     take it in. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. 

     And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing 
     and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly 
     resists.  He senses it and pulls away.  

                          ETHAN 
                Sorry. 

     He rises and goes to the door.  He's got his hand on the knob 
     when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him 
     to her and kisses him, deeply.  This time they sink slowly to 
     the bed. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. CIA LANGLEY - DAY 

     Seen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex, 
     two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked 
     out of a thick forest. 

                          LANGLEY

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY 

     KITTRIDGE, BARNES, and their STAFF are hard at work, 
     photographs and biographical data of ETHAN on various 
     computer and television screens around the room.  KITTRIDGE 
     leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. 

                          BARNES 
                What I want to know is how Hunt accessed 
                the disavowed file, even after we cut off 
                his authorization code. 

                          AGENT LOWDEN/AGENT 
                          MAREK 
                He may have used Phelps' code. They were 
                friends, and Phelps, was still valid for 
                twenty-four hours.  

                          BARNES 
                If that's the case, we need to implement 
                a system to immediately deactivate an 
                agent's code immediately... 

        KITTRIDGE brings his chair legs down on the floor with a 
        BANG. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I can't believe what I'm listening to. 
                Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys 
                are standing here trying to figure out 
                what kind of shoes he had on!  I don't
                care how he did it, I want to know why he 
                did it!  Is he recruiting?  For what 
                purpose? 

     From somewhere in the building, an ALARM sounds, not too loud 
     in here. 

                          AGENT PAT/AGENT 
                          LOWDEN

     The alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the 
     building. 

                          KITTRIDGE
                Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive,
                he initiates.  The question is what does 
                he want now and where does he need to get 
                it and Barnes what the hell is that
                noise?! 

     An AGENT is just coming in from the hallway. 

                          AGENT 
                Fire alarm, Gene.

                          BARNES
                That's S.O.P..

     SIRENS BLARING, three fire trucks race past an inconspicuous 
     gray van parked on the shoulder of a two lane highway. 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY LOBBY - DAY                               

     Three FIREMEN stomp into the main lobby of the CIA 
     headquarters building.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are among them, in 
     firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment.  

     ETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk.  He 
     looks up, above him. 

     Etched into the top of one wall are the words "AND YE SHALL 
     KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE."

     They reach the GUARD.  ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows 
     to the front of the group and takes charge. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to the Guard) 
                We picked up alarms in sectors three, 
                seven, and twelve. 

     The GUARD checks a screen in front of him. 

                          GUARD RICHARD 
                Yeah.  That's what I've got too. 

     The FIREMEN look at each other.  Who is this guy?  But he 
     seems to know what he's talking about, so -- 

                          ETHAN 
                     (to the Guard) 
                What sector's the air conditioning? 

                          GUARD RANDALL 
                Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in 
                sector twenty-one. 

                          ETHAN 
                I gotta go in there and shut it down! 

                          GUARD RANDALL 
                Nobody goes into any sector where the 
                alarm didn't go off. 

                          ETHAN
                Do you want to blow the fire through the

     One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the 
     parking area of the headquarters building.  Second truck 
     roars past.  LUTHER watches it go. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

     LUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of 
     equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- 
     dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company 
     manuals with names like "COSMOS" and "SWITCHED ACCESS 
     SERVICE." 

     One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image 
     in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn 
     GUARD, who's finishing his sentence. 
        
                          GUARD 
                     (on screen) 
                --and it did not go off in twenty-one! 

     LUTHER turns to a screen on another computer and searches 
     through a complex facilities menu. 

                          LUTHER 
                     (mouths) 
                Twenty-one, twenty-one --

     He finds what he's looking for and double clicks on it.  A 
     red box on his screen lights up -- 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY                               

     -- and the same red box lights up on the GUARD'S screen. 
     From in the distance, a new ALARM begins to wail. 

                          GUARD RANDALL 
                Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go. 

                          ETHAN
                Let's move! 

     ETHAN turns and looks at one of the FIREMEN behind them -- 
     it's CLAIRE.  CLAIRE and KRIEGER follow ETHAN/GUARD to 
     corridor. 

     INT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY 

     CLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing 
     a business suit underneath.  She clips an ID tag to her 
     breast pocket.  

     She pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer 
     printout of a man's ID photo.  She stares at the face, 
     studying it. 

     INT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY 

     CLAIRE, carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin, looks for a 
     spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters 
     building. 

     She sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper.  It's the 
     man whose picture she looked at in the storage room.  She 
     sits next to him. 

     He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then 
     goes back to his paper. 

     He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing 
     the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a 
     perfume sampler.  She dumps the clear liquid contents into 
     his coffee.  He turns back and hands her part of the paper. 
     CLAIRE smiles. 

     COFFEE MAN drinks up.  CLAIRE stares at his shoulder 
     strangely.  He notices. 

     She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. 

     He smiles.  But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder 
     blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of 
     shiny gray metallic tape.  CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE 
     MAN drinks up and leaves the table. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY

     LUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a 
     blueprint of the inside of the building.  A cursor begins to 
     flash in one of the rooms.  LUTHER smiles. 

                          LUTHER 
                Hi there. 

     INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY                               

     A GUARD carrying an MP5, a handheld machine gun, leads ETHAN 
     and KRIEGER to a heavy metal door marked SERVICE. 

                          GUARD 
                Air conditioning's through here! 

     They turn a corner, walking directly past -- 

     -- COFFEE MAN, who's coming the other way.  We stay with 
     COFFEE MAN. 

     INT. CIA LANGLEY - CORRIDORS - DAY                            
        
     COFFEE MAN comes out of the cafeteria, walks down the 
     corridor. he goes to the restricted access door, taps the 
     control panel. 

                          CIA ANALYST
                William Donloe. 

     COFFEE MAN (ANALYST) walks past a GUARD desk and peers into 
     an optometric scanner and we suddenly remember where we've 
     seen COFFEE MAN before.  He's the TECHNICIAN who works at the 
     secured computer terminal. 

     INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY 

     ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing.  ETHAN 
     putting the mask in a bag. 

     The GUARD returns. 

                          GUARD 
                Where's the other guy? 

     The GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing 
     him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the 
     neck.  He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. 
     KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. 

     ETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER 
     pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with 
     the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - 

     -- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife 
     arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S 
     face in warning. 

                          ETHAN 
                Zero body count. 

                          KRIEGER 
                     (a threat) 
                We'll see.  

                          ETHAN
                Time up. 

     ETHAN releases him and walks away. 

     INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY 

     The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area 
     Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the 
     duct system. 

     The first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under 
     ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to 
     climb. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY 

     ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving 
     horizontally now.  They reach a juncture and turn right. 

                          ETHAN 
                1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast.  Luther, I'm 
                going in.  Don't disappoint me...Krieger, 
                from here on in, absolute silence. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                             

     ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct.  A 
     laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- 
     crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. 

     He can see the computer room below and the top of the 
     TECHNICIAN'S head. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                              

     In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of 
     his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- 
     sided, pyramid shaped glass object.  

     ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of 
     the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what 
     it is -- a prism. 

     The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully 
     moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and 
     directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the 
     shaft. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

     Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move 
     in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready 
     to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between 
     the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. 

     The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the 
     floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip 
     with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. 

     The screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole 
     shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. 

     It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. 

     A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop 
     near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A 
     gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the 
     tube, cooling the room. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the 
     terminal room. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw 
     earlier.  No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the 
     gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. 

     Now ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair 
     falling in front of him. 

     At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, 
     but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then 
     shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his 
     ankles and understand.  

     He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and 
     temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is 
     lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the 
     computer as the ANALYST enters the room. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                  

     The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack 
     of work to his right. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                    

     The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer.  He pauses 
     and wipes some sweat from his forehead. 

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                      

     With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. 
     It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead -- 

                          TECHNICIAN 
                Oh, God. 

     -- he vomits.  

     He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again.  Puzzled, 
     sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to 
     his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY                             

     Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the 
     alarm systems with a card-key.  They HUM back to life 
     efficiently, a light flashing: 

                INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON

     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                   

     ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the 
     same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in 
     front of the computer. 

     A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a 
     rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the 
     set of pulleys. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY 

     KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out 
     on his forehead. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     Unfortunately, he's three feet away from it.  He stretches 
     his arms but can't reach. 

     He blinks, unable to believe this.  He curls himself into a 
     situp and looks up, into the shaft. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                      

     KRIEGER sees the predicament. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor.  Slowly, 
     KRIEGER drops him another few feet.  Now ETHAN's lower than 
     the terminal and still three feet away from it. 
        
     He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another 
     situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                 

     In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco 
     monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what 
     ETHAN sees. 

     He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and 
     begins to whisper.  We hear only the moist, airy sound of his 
     breath, not the words. 

                          LUTHER 
                Type this password: AW96B6.  Return.  Go 
                to the files menu, find the NOC list 
                file.  Open "NOC List."  Put your 
                diskette in.  Double click on the NOC 
                list. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     ETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly.  He reaches 
     out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it
     and starts typing, softly. 

     The computer HUMS, activated.  ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, 
     withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy 
     drive. 

     The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR.  ETHAN winces, even 
     that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.  

     But no alarms go off. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          

     LUTHER cranes his head again to see the computer terminal 
     through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint.  He WHISPERS more 
     commands.

                          LUTHER 
                Ok, good!  It's scrolling.  0K, now we're 
                going to download.  Edit menu.  Select 
                "copy to disc".  You're downloading. 
                When it's all green it's done. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

     ETHAN types in the contends, presses enter and the screen 
     displays a comforting message:

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                           

     LUTHER'S eyes widen as he gets his first look, on the Visco 
     monitor, of the specific information they're downloading. 
     The NOC list. 

                          LUTHER 
                Holy mother of God. 

     INT. DUCT - DAY                                                

     KRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope.  His eyes 
     suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. 

     It's a rat.  KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back.  Neither 
     moves.  Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls 
     forward, inquisitive. 

     KRIEGER's eyes water, his nose twitches.  He's about to 
     sneeze. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          

     LUTHER pulls himself together and WHISPERS another command 
     into the microphone. 

                          LUTHER 
                You've done it.  Eject it. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

     The 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive.  ETHAN pockets 
     it and signals to be raised. 

     Slowly, his body starts to move up.  As it does, a bead of 
     sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. 

     ETHAN ignores it.  But below him, he sees the floor tiles, 
     four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the 
     computer terminal.  

     His eyes widen as he realizes something -- 

     --the drop of sweat falls -- 

     --and he catches it with his right hand. 

     INT. CIA - MEN'S - DAY                                    

     CIA ANALYST crosses corridor from restricted access door to 
     bathroom. 

     A toilet FLUSHES, smashing the silence, and the TECHNICIAN 
     staggers out of the bathroom. He goes to the sink and throws 
     some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of 
     shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade. 

     He walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                       

     On one of LUTHER'S laptops, the blinking cursor starts to 
     move down a corridor.  LUTHER speaks into his microphone. 

                          LUTHER 
                He's rolling.  Get moving! 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             

     ETHAN is near the ceiling, but KRIEGER isn't pulling any 
     more.  ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull 
     him up.  KRIEGER shakes his head no. 

     ETHAN gestures -- "WHAT?!" 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                     

     The cursor is halfway across the screen. 

                          LUTHER 
                Get out of there -- get out of there --

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                

     ETHAN still dangles.  Holding the rope with one hand, KRIEGER 
     holds out his other, demanding something.  He wants the disk. 

     INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY                             

     The TECHNICIAN makes his way back down the corridor, toward 
     the computer room. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          

     The blinking cursor is near the edge of the screen and LUTHER
     is sweating. 

                          LUTHER 
                He's at the vault - get moving!  1 
                yellow, 2 yellows...Toast! 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     ETHAN, still hanging upside down, has refused.  KRIEGER 
     demands again. 

     INT. CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY                                

     The TECHNICIAN passes through the optometric scanner.

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                

     ETHAN has the diskette in his mouth.  KRIEGER leans down and 
     takes it.  He drops the knife. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Merci. 

                          ETHAN 
                We're not outta here yet. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY 

     The TECHNICIAN deactivates the alarm systems, swings the 
     door open and comes back into the room.  

     He turns to close the door behind him and in so doing just 
     misses seeing ETHAN'S head as it is pulled back up into the 
     ceiling. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     frantically back through the duct, the way they came.

     CLAIRE walks quickly past the GUARDS in the reception area 
     and out of the building. 

     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               

     The TECHNICIAN enters the room and shuts the door.  He sees 
     the knife, picks it up, looks at it and then puts it down. 
     He resumes his work at the computer but when he punches up 
     his program, something prints out on his screen.  Its header:

     And it goes on.  The TECHNICIAN'S eyes widen in disbelief. 
     He spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest 
     telephone. 

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY                           

     In the communications room, tempers are running a little 
     high.  KITTRIDGE is on his feet, berating his staff. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Think, for Christ's sake, you guys are 
                mired in detail, open your minds, it's 
                gotta be staring us in the face!  What 
                does Ethan Hunt want?! 

                          BARNES 
                Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same 
                thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list! 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Okay! 

     Now it's coming together in KITTRIDGE'S mind and a horrible 
     thought occurs to him. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                And where is the list vulnerable? 

     There is nervous silence for a moment.  Behind KITTRIDGE, on 
     the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. 

     An AGENT gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the 
     room. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                     (joking) 
                Other than here. 

     Nervous laughter goes around the table.  It fades.  On the 
     other side of the room, the AGENT who answered the phone 
     turns, receiver in hand, face ashen. 

     He holds the phone out to KITTRIDGE, terrified, the bearer of 
     extremely bad news. 

     They all turn slowly and look at him.  He holds the phone out 
     to KITTRIDGE, shaking slightly. 

                          AGENT 
                It's for you. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Kittridge, yup?

     It may be a HUMAN SCREAM or it may be a SIREN'S WAIL but it 
     echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck ROARS away from 
     the headquarters building, making its escape. 

     INT. FIRE TRUCK - MOVING - DAY                                

     LUTHER, KRIEGER, CLAIRE and ETHAN, the victorious team, are 
     in the truck's cab.  They exchange looks of massive relief. 
     But no one speaks.  LUTHER, in particular, looks heavily 
     troubled by what they've just done. 

     ETHAN looks at CLAIRE, who is jammed into the seat next to 
     him.  She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted. 

     KRIEGER, in the driver's seat literally and figuratively. 

     ETHAN just looks straight ahead and to CLAIRE. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY                           

     The TECHNICIAN who discovered the theft of the list sits at 
     one end of the now-empty conference table in the 
     communications room.  KITTRIDGE sits in a chair beside, 
     staring gravely at him. 

     He gets up and walks to the door, where HARRY BARNES hovers. 
     KITTRIDGE lowers his voice, it's barely audible. 

                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) 
                     (to Barnes) 
                You and I know about this -- and that's 
                where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened. 

                          BARNES 
                What about him...? 

     He gestures to the TECHNICIAN, who watches them anxiously. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I want him manning a radar tower in 
                Alaska by the end of the day.  Just mail 
                him his clothes. 

     He leaves.  Barnes turns to the TECHNICIAN, who looks up at 
     him anxiously. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. LONDON - NIGHT                                       

     Night. This street is a row of nondescript hotels, one after 
     the other, with anonymous names like "Hotel Pomeroy," "Hotel 
     Vincent," and "Hotel Berridge." 

                          LONDON 

     INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                            

     This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of 
     buildings it's in.  ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight 
     bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered 
     bible he's used to contact Max.  He flips through the pages 
     and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and 
     waiting on the tiny desk. 

     LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously 
     preoccupied.  KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a 
     lager and watching CNN. 

     CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. 

     KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. 

                          KRIEGER 
                You contacting your buyer? 
                     (no answer) 
                Ethan? 

     From the desk, ETHAN glances up.  Then goes back to the 
     computer.  KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. 

                          KRIEGER (CONT'D) 
                Ethan?  Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? 

     ETHAN ignores him, working.  His computer jams with static as 
     it connects to a BBS.  The screen blinks and displays the 
     familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted 
     Max.  When it asks him which chapter and verse for the 
     posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next 
     code.  He  begins to type. 

                MAX -- Now might be an excellent time 
                to interpret Scripture face to face. 
                Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.  Take 
                seat 27.  Bring our mutual friend 
                Job.

     KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible 
     out of Ethan's hands to the floor. 

                          KRIEGER 
                You're not going to any meeting without me. 

                          ETHAN 
                My contact is extremely shy. 

     He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the 
     "ENTER" button. 

     LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN 
     sighs and stands up.  KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took 
     from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. 

                          KRIEGER 
                I don't think you're in any position to 
                give orders, do you?  Not while I'm 
                holding this. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Krieger. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Stay out of this. 
                OR 
                Lachez - moi 
                OR  
                T'agueue 

                          ETHAN 
                Don't you mean this? 

     He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical 
     disk.  He puts it back in his jacket pocket. 

     KRIEGER stares for a second. 

                          KRIEGER
                That's not it.  That's not the list. 

                          ETHAN 
                What's the matter, you don't know this 
                trick? 

     He holds the jacket pocket wide open, for KRIEGER to look 
     into.  KRIEGER does.  The pocket is empty. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                     (mock surprise) 
                Where did it go?!  It's GONE! 

     ETHAN walks over to CLAIRE, reaches into the pocket of the 
     trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                But not too far! 

     He palms the disk in his right hand. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                I know what you're thinking, Krieger. 
                You're thinking, back in the computer 
                room -- I was up here -- he was down 
                there -- .  He was carrying two discs. 

     While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from KRIEGER. 
     When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again.  He holds up 
     his left hand.  It's there now. 

                          ETHAN (CONT'D) 
                So hard to keep track of these things. 

     ETHAN shows his hands -- now both are empty. 

                          KRIEGER 
                     (fuming) 
                Where is it? 

     ETHAN pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. 

                          ETHAN 
                I thought you had it!  Do you actually 
                think I'd let you have the NOC list? 

     KRIEGER just stares at him, shaken.  CLAIRE laughs.  KRIEGER 
     looks at her.  He turns completely red.  When he looks back 
     at ETHAN, ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand. 

                          KRIEGER 
                Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and 
                Iíll cut your throat. 

     He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms 
     out, SLAMMING the door behind him.  ETHAN picks up the Bible 
     and sees Drake Hotel. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've 
                never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan. 

                          ETHAN 
                We did what we had to do. 

                          CLAIRE 
                I'm going to try and get some sleep. 

     She leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving ETHAN and 
     LUTHER alone. 

     ANGLE                                                      

     ETHAN waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, 
     picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off 
     carefully. 

     He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his 
     jacket pocket. 

                          LUTHER 
                Krieger did have the NOC list. 

                          ETHAN 
                Now I want you to hold onto it. 

                          LUTHER 
                What makes you trust me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Because if you knew what you were getting 
                into, you never would have done it. 

                          LUTHER 
                I'm not letting this list get out in the 
                open. 

                          ETHAN 
                Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on 
                the train, you can't let this list get 
                out into the open.  What's the range of 
                this thing? 

                          LUTHER 
                It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be 
                close. 

                          ETHAN 
                I'll get you close. 

     Claire opens the door. 

                          CLAIRE 
                Ethan I need to talk to you. 

     ETHAN follows CLAIRE into her room where she shows him the 
     television screen.

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT                             

     A light flashes and a phone BUZZES.  KITTRIDGE in shirt and 
     tie, picks up.  BARNES and several other AGENTS are 
     monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities 
     related to the Hunt case. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (picking up) 
                Kittridge. 

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                I see you've been out visiting the folks. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (covers receiver) 
                It's Hunt.  What do you need for a 
                pinpoint? 
                     (to Ethan) 
                Been watching a little T.V., have you? 

     One of the technicians frantically scratches something on a 
     piece of foolscap and waves it at KITTRIDGE:  "80 SECONDS". 

     KITTRIDGE nods. 

     EXT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT                             

                          ETHAN
                Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was 
                an especially nice touch. 

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT                           

     At the console, the number 44 flashes on the TECHNICIAN'S 
     screen. 

                          TECHNICIAN 
                He's in England. 

     BARNES scratches England and 22 seconds on foolscap and waves 
     it. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                     (covering receiver) 
                Get MI5. 

     The TECHNICIAN opens another line on his console and begins 
     patching through to Whitehall. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Ethan, I want to reassure you that my 
                first order of business after you come in 
                is to get these ridiculous charges 
                against your family dropped and 
                eliminated completely from their files. 
                Come in now, we can plea down the charges 
                against you as well. 

     The wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down.  The 
     TECHNICIAN is frantically signalling KITTRIDGE to keep 
     talking.  KITTRIDGE is momentarily stuck.  Fortunately: 

                          ETHAN (O.S.) 
                Can I ask you something, Kittridge? 
                
                          KITTRIDGE 
                Certainly Ethan. 

     INT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT                             

                          ETHAN 
                If you're dealing with someone who's 
                crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five 
                members of his own IMF team, how 
                devastated do you think you're going to 
                make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald 
                down to the county courthouse? 

     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT                            

                          KITTRIDGE 
                I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me? 

     Click.  ETHAN has hung up.  KITTRIDGE looks hopefully to the 
     TECHNICIAN who says: 

                          BARNES 
                Lost him.  We needed three more seconds. 

     Surprisingly KITTRIDGE is not as upset as he is puzzled. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                He wanted us to know he was in London. 

     Clearly that's the question that KITTRIDGE is turning over in 
     his mind and he doesn't have a simple answer to it. 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. PHONE BOX - LONDON - NIGHT                           

     Close Digital clock.  It reads 23.59.  Angle widens to show 
     ETHAN looking at it with grim satisfaction.  He opens the 
     door of the phone booth and almost SMACKS right into -- 

     --the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just 
     inches in front of him.  Startled, ETHAN looks up, but what 
     he sees shakes him to the core. 

     The man is JIM PHELPS. 

     ETHAN SHOUTS and almost falls back into the phone booth. 
     PHELPS leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly. 

                          PHELPS 
                You're a hard man to catch up with. 
                
     PHELPS falls towards ETHAN.  ETHAN tries to speak, but can't 
     even form words. 

     INT - RAILWAY STATION CAFE (DAY) 

     ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth, PHELPS 
     looking clammy and listing to one side.  But the banter 
     seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close 
     colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, 
     finishing each other's sentences: 

                          PHELPS
                ..the next day I managed to drag myself 
                to the safe house, must've just missed 
                you..anyway, I checked our aliases.

                          ETHAN
                - and picked us up in the States -

                          PHELPS 
                - but you left before I could get there 
                and I could check just so many places.. 

                          ETHAN 
                Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize 
                customs records - 

                          PHELPS 
                - so I watched Europe. Once you showed 
                up in England..it was easy. 

                          ETHAN 
                You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool 
                Street. 

                          PHELPS 
                Hey, I showed 'em to you! 

                          ETHAN 
                I remember.. 

     PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an 
     upright position.  He opens a medicine bottle and takes the 
     pain killers. 

                          ETHAN 
                Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A 
                doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't 
                sit up straight. 

                          PHELPS 
                I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit 
                up straight very well.  It's not 
                important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I 
                saw the mole.  It was Kittridge. 
                     (a fist into the table) 
                Kittridge! 

     PHELPS grips the sides of the table. 

                          ETHAN 
                Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the 
                mole? 

                          PHELPS 
                Yeah. 

                          ETHAN 
                How did Kittridge do it?.. 

     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT                           

     A reprise of PHELPS'S narrative only now ETHAN'S telling it 
     and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually 
     happened. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                - first he took care of Jack in the 
                elevator - 
        
     At the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the 
     building, watching it go and crush Kiefer. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                - he shot you on the bridge - 

     On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the 
     gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them 
     into the Vltava River. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                - he must have had back up take out 
                Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.. 

     There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER 
     who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence.. 

                          ETHAN VO 
                How did he do Hannah? 

     Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the 
     detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion 
     brilliant behind her... 

                          ETHAN VO 
                No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah 
                himself. 

     PHELPS presses the remote detonator and the car blows.. 

     OVER SHOULDER - PHELPS (INT. RAILWAY CAFE)

     ETHAN looking intently at him.

                          ETHAN
                Why, Jim?  Why?

     Awkward moment.

                          PHELPS
                ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was
                inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more
                secrets you keep from everyone but
                yourself, operations you answer to no one
                but yourself.  Then one morning you wake
                up and find out the President of the
                United States is running the country -
                without your permission.  The son-of-a-
                bitch!  How dare he?  You realize itís
                over, youíre an obsolete piece of
                hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got
                a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a 
                year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no
                good son-of-a-bitch, big time!

                          ETHAN
                We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after
                us.

                          PHELPS
                Whatís going to make him do that?

                          ETHAN
                What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC
                list.

                          PHELPS
                Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.

                          ETHAN
                A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to
                Paris.

                          PHELPS
                Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.

                          ETHAN
                If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to
                Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.
                Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with
                me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will
                have helicopter transport waiting in
                Paris.

     PHELPS looks away.  Seems badly shaken.

                          ETHAN
                Jim...?

                          PHELPS
                I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you
                and suddenly there she was, standing in
                the rain just outside the safe
                house..alive and beautiful..and thinking
                Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís
                had to do forget about me to keep going
                and get the job done, I..

     PHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle
     over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it:

                          PHELPS
                - no.  She canít know about me.  No one
                can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too
                much at stake, Ethan.

                          ETHAN
                Youíre probably right.

                          PHELPS
                I usually am.

                          ETHAN
                Once we leave the safehouse, get in there
                and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.

                          PHELPS
                You got it.

                          ETHAN
                And get a doctor.

                          PHELPS
                Good luck.

     INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - CLAIREíS ROOM - NIGHT

     The door to CLAIRE'S room in the safe house opens, throwing a
     shaft of light over her form.  ETHAN creeps in and closes the
     door behind him.

     It is approximately one a.m. .  CLAIRE is huddled in the
     corner.  ETHAN enters and stands looking at her.

                          CLAIRE
                What happened?

                          ETHAN
                  (walks towards her)
                I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for
                tomorrow.

                          CLAIRE
                Okay...

                          ETHAN 
                  (he steps towards her, stops)
                Is this the only way?

                          CLAIRE
                Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...

     She draws him down by his hand to kiss her.

     He kisses her again, more fully.  She wraps an arm around him
     and he holds onto the kiss.  The room appears to revolve
     around them.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. PRIVATE HELIPAD - DAY

     Suddenly itís bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our
     eyes.

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking
     at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.

     TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall
     into step alongside, ready to brief him.  One of them holds
     out a small package with "for Job" written on it.

     KITTRIDGE looks at him.  He rips it open.  A note inside
     simply says:

                      TGV.  LONDON TERMINUS
                              Noon.

     KITTRIDGE looks at his watch.  Itís ten to twelve.

     As he reads the note, something else falls out of the
     envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.

     He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.  Cradled in his
     hand, we canít see what it is.  But to him, itís very
     interesting.

     He steps up his pace, headed for the car.

                          KITTRIDGE
                     (to the Agent) 
                How long to the London Terminus?

                          AGENT
                Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Youíve got ten.  Move!

     INT. WATERLOO STATION PLATFORM - DAY

     The sleek front power car, looking like the nose of an SST,
     gets its 25,000 volt charge from the overhead catenary.

     The rear power car gets its jolt.

     The TGV starts to move, pulling out of the station.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     The business car is similar to the one ETHAN saw on the first
     train they look across Europe.  Itís crowded, maybe THIRTY
     MEN and WOMEN in suits, most of them already immersed in work
     on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones.

     One such woman is MAX in her seat, number 27.  MATTHIAS and
     the OTHER MAN, last seen dropping off ETHAN in Prague, sit
     across from her, her laptop is on the table next to her, in
     her briefcase.

                          MAX
                How long until we reach the Chunnel?

                          MATTHIAS
                Twenty minutes.

     INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY

     A MAN puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on
     the bunk-bed.  We only see his hands as he proceeds to take
     the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and
     assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous
     electrical parts inside.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     MAX is reading the Financial Times.  MATTHIAS is looking out
     of the window.  A cellular phone rings inside MAXís briefcase
     in front of MATTHIAS.  MATTHIAS takes the phone out.

                          MATTHIAS
                Yes...
                     (holds phone out for Max)
                Itís him.

                          MAX
                     (into phone) 
                This wasnít what we discussed.

                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                     (on phone) 
                My apologies Max.  Couldnít be helped.
                Thereís a piece of black cloth under your
                seat.  Tear it away and youíll find the
                disk.

     MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer
     disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off
     the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the
     computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns
     the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to
     see.

     One half of the screen, with the heading "CRYPTONYM AND
     OPERATIONAL SPECS" is already jammed with information.  The
     blank second half of the screen acquires the title "TRUE
     NAME," and information starts filling itself in rapidly --
     names, addresses, identities.

     As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:

                IDENTITY MATCH

                          MAX
                     (back into phone) 
                Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít
                prelude a meeting in private.

                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you
                tell me where the money is.

                          MAX
                The possibility alone is worth ten
                million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver
                briefcase.  Combination 314.

                          ETHAN (O.S.)
                What about Job?

                          MAX
                I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve
                got the money -- heíll find you.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE)

     LUTHER, three rows behind in another seat, is at work on a
     laptop of his own.  A mobile Nokia phone is beside it - red
     light flashing.

     INT. SECOND CLASS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car.  They
     turn around and start working their way back again.

     At the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate.  A LARGE MAN
     passes through the door behind her.

     The LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES,
     who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order
     to make room for him to pass.  As they move by him, their
     vision is momentarily blocked --

     -- and CLAIRE gets up to follow.

     She follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the
     door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in
     doorway.

                          BARNES
                Only four more cars.

                          KITTRIDGE
                And if we donít find him - weíll search
                the whole train again.

                          BARNES
                Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?

                          KITTRIDGE
                High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No-
                one gets off.  High security.  Good place
                for a pass off to Max.

                          BARNES
                But why tell us?

                          KITTRIDGE
                Heís putting on a show, Barnes.

                          BARNES
                What kind of show.

                          KITTRIDGE
                I donít know.
                     (looks at his wrist monitor)
                It didnít say on the tickets.

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES go off back through the next coach.
     CLAIRE follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into
     her wristwatch to ETHAN:

                          CLAIRE
                Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.

                          ETHAN
                Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How
                far is he from Luther?

                          CLAIRE
                Two cars.  Where are you?

                          ETHAN
                You are my eyes.  Stay with him.

     She moves onto the next coach, going after KITTRIDGE and
     BARNES.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY

     On her computer screen in the business car, an ominous
     message flashes.

                LIST COMPLETE

     MAX dials a number on her cellular phone. She is calling Job.

                          MAX
                     (into phone)
                Heís in the baggage car.

                          PHELPS (O/S)
                     (assembling gun in sleeping
                     compartment)
                Iíll be there.

     MAX hangs up and hands the phone to MATTHIAS who slots it
     into the briefcase next to the computer.  He dials a number
     on the keyboard and pushes send.  The computer emits a DIAL
     TONE.  Her computer flashes a message.

                MODEM DENIED

                          MAX
                Whatís the problem.

                          MATTHIAS
                Connection denied.

                          MAX
                Try it again.

                          MATTHIAS
                Itís not working.

                          MAX
                Is something wrong with the phone?
                  (Pause as he tries the phone)
                Well is something wrong with the
                batteries?

                          MATTHIAS
                I always check the batteries.

                          MAX
                Run it through from the top.

     INT. REAR CAR (SLEEPING COMPARTMENT) - MOVING - DAY

     The MAN assembling the gun CLICKS the last piece, the
     silencer, into place.

     INT. CAR (NEXT TO MAXíS CAR) - MOVING - DAY

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES looking - stop in doorway.

                          BARNES
                Nothing but civilians, Gene.

                          KITTRIDGE
                This is bullshit - we donít even know
                what Max looks like.

                          BARNES
                Maybe we donít have to know what he looks
                like.  If heís got that list, heís going
                to want to check it.  We should be
                looking for laptops.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Good idea.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - (LUTHER) - MOVING - DAY

     LUTHER sees them coming.  He smacks the laptop shut and
     positions his jamming phone on the table to point at Maxís
     computer.  He gets up, taking his computer with him, headed
     for the rear of the car.  A WAITER sees the phone and goes
     after LUTHER with it.

                          WAITER
                Excuse me, Sir, your telephone...

     OTHER PASSENGERSí phones nearby go haywire.  LUTHER looks to
     MAX.  Exits car.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY

     Her dial tone finally hits the static of a computer
     connection and the message on her screen changes:

                TRANSFER IN PROGRESS

                          MATTHIAS
                Itís working.

                          MAX
                Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     LUTHER shuts himself in the bathroom.  The OTHER MAN follows
     him, tries the door and waits his moment.  The OTHER MAN
     bangs against the door.  LUTHER braces himself against the
     door.

     INT. ANOTHER CAR - MOVING - DAY

     CLAIRE walking through.  She pauses to listen in her
     earpiece.

                          ETHAN (O/S)
                Iíve got the money.  Meet me in the
                baggage car.

     She walks on.

     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES are looking at the people in the
     Business Car behind MAX.  CLAIRE passes them by heading for
     the last executive coach to get to Club and Baggage Car.  She
     passes the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.  He follows her.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Get this door open.

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES have seen CLAIRE go through MAXíS
     Business Car and past the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.
     They follow, but suspect the locked bathroom door and stop
     there to listen.

     INT. LAST EXECUTIVE CAR - MOVING - DAY

     CLAIRE moves swiftly through the last car (after MAXíS car).
     up into the Club Car and opens the door leading to the
     BAGGAGE CAR.  Goes in.  The door slams shut.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Hello, Luther.  Whereís Hunt?

                          LUTHER
                Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being
                modemed off the train.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Where?

     INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY

     CLAIRE enters a little breathless.  Spotting PHELPíS profile
     in the darkened car.

                          CLAIRE
                Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me
                Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him?
                We take the money.  Ethan takes the
                blame.  No-one else has seen you alive.
                No-one will believe him.

                          ETHAN
                Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say
                that Claire.

                          CLAIRE
                Ethan?

                          PHELPS
                Yes.  Ethan Hunt, darling.  Remember him?

     Here PHELPS pulls out his assembled pistol.

                          CLAIRE
                You knew about Jim?

                          PHELPS
                Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew
                is something of a question.  Before or
                after I showed in London, mind telling
                me, Ethan?

                          ETHAN
                Before London.  But after you took the
                Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

                          PHELPS
                They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn
                Gideons.

     PHELPíS watch alarm goes off.

                          PHELPS
                Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll
                have to be quicker than Iíd like.
                Certainly quicker than youíd like.

                          CLAIRE
                Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..

                          PHELPS
                Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk?
                Well, Claire, youíve asked the question
                and you are the answer.

                          ETHAN
                I knew about Jim.

                          PHELPS
                But, he didnít know about you.  In all
                fairness, Ethan, Claire was never
                convinced her charms would work with you.
                But I was supremely confident - having
                tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet
                thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan
                is in love with you, Claire, make no
                mistake about it.  And like all the 
                worldís lovers, heís tortured by the
                same, one pathetic question - "does she
                feel the same way I do?"

     JIM turns to CLAIRE.

                          PHELPS
                Well Claire do you?  Have you been
                exploiting his feelings or returning
                them?

                          CLAIRE
                Jim - lets just get the money and get out
                of here.

     CLAIRE goes to ETHAN.

                          CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                The money Ethan.

     ETHAN hands her the money.

                          ETHAN
                Youíve earned it.

     CLAIRE goes to Jim with the money.

                          PHELPS
                Count it.

     CLAIRE starts to count.

                          ETHAN
                Tell me something Claire, that night in
                Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up
                the car and scattered Hannah all over
                town?

                          PHELPS
                Keep counting Claire.

                          CLAIRE
                It was me.  I did it.

     CLAIRE hands PHELPS the money.


                          PHELPS
                Satisfied?

                          CLAIRE
                All ten million.

                          PHELPS
                Fold it.  Fold it tight.

                          ETHAN
                Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten
                million is better than six.

                          PHELPS
                Donít flatter yourself - six was for
                Eastern Europe.  You made a lousy deal -
                ten for the world?  What is that?  But I
                needed you for the transfer with Max.  I
                got a little extra change;  and you got a
                little extra too.

     PHELPíS watch alarm goes off.

                          PHELPS
                Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.

                          ETHAN
                Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not
                the only one whoís seen you alive.

     ETHAN throws JIM the Visco glasses.

                          KITTRIDGE
                Good morning, Mr Phelps.

     PHELPS and CLAIRE are stunned.

                          PHELPS
                You son of a bitch.

     PHELPS points the gun at ETHAN.

                          CLAIRE
                Donít Jim.

                          PHELPS
                Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You
                like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?

                          CLAIRE
                Yes.

                          ETHAN
                Jim, itís over.

                          PHELPS
                Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing
                can be more dangerous than the truth.  It
                can kill you.

     PHELPS shoots CLAIRE.  Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN.
     The gun is lost.  PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground.  His
     watch alarm beeps rapidly.  He turns, goes up the stairs
     and...

     ETHAN goes to CLAIRE.
                          
                          ETHAN
                Claire...Hey...

                          CLAIRE
                This stuff is so sticky.

                          ETHAN
                Claire.

                          CLAIRE
                Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me
                back...wonít you...

                          ETHAN 
                I always have, Claire.. 

     CLAIRE dies.  ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder. 

     INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY

     PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over 
     the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. 
     PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door 
     and climbs through it -- 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     -- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into 
     his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle 
     on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof 
     and pulls himself the rest of the way out. 

     He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the 
     smooth surface of the train. 

     Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS 
     slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and 
     replanting the cups as he goes.  

     He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the 
     back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, 
     a window for the ENGINEER. 

     Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his 
     belt.

     He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out 
     of the fog, a helicopter approaches. 

     PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is 
     going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching 
     the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen. 

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     KRIEGER is at the controls.  He sees the approaching tunnel 
     as well. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position.  Looking up, he 
     sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. 

     ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. 

     A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost 
     touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. 

     ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. 
     Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to 
     grab small holes on the roof.  

     He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other 
     way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. 

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures 
     to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing 
     over PHELPS and then back to him. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto 
     his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the 
     roof. 

     ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto 
     the roof. 

     PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously 
     closer to the chunnel entrance. 

     They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. 

     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

     KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at 
     the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

     PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the 
     train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the 
     strap manages to pull himself back on. 

     -- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- 

     -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! 

     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

     As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes 
     nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes 
     one last time.  This time it says: 

                CONNECTION TERMINATED. 
                    TRANSFER LOST.

     MAX'S face falls. 

                          MAX
                Damn!

     INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY

     Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert 
     companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the 
     train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. 

                          CONDUCTOR 
                No, no, it's IN the tunnel! 

                          VOICE (O.S.) 
                Stop the train! 

                          CONDUCTOR 
                It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, 
                accelerate. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY

     For a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving 
     around to the other end of the car, we see where they've 
     gone. 

     They're dangling from either side of it. 

     PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself 
     back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other 
     cup. 

     The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track 
     and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER 
     pushing it up to full speed again. 

     But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the 
     train. 

     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY

     PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the 
     windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of 
     KRIEGER'S copter. 

     He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the 
     other direction. 

     Another train. 

     At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the 
     oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the 
     roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as 
     it blows by. 

     The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS 
     misses the skid.  

     KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate 
     ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the 
     copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the 
     tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.  

     KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to 
     leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. 

     PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. 
     Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls 
     out -- 

     -- a red and green piece of bubble gum. 

     PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles 
     frantically for his gun. 

                          ETHAN 
                Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna 
                mother fucker. 

     ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the 
     copter's underbelly and turns away from it. 

     PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- 

     -- but the gum EXPLODES.  The force of the blast rockets 
     ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield. 

     The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers 
     wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under 
     the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. 

     ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the 
     wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. 
     It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor 
     blade barely missing his throat.  

     ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly 
     drained. 

     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY

     KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by 
     BARNES.  LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to 
     them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. 

                          LUTHER
                I think this is what you're looking for. 

     MAX looks up, stunned.  KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her 
     screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to 
     wait for her to speak. 

     When she finally does, she's almost charming. 

                          MAX 
                My lawyers will have a field day with 
                this.  Entrapment, jurisdictional 
                conflicts -- 

     KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as 
     friendly. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of 
                this one. 

                          MAX 
                I'm sure we can find something I have 
                that you need. 

                          KITTRIDGE 
                You know, I would love to try. 

     EXT. LONDON PUB - DAY

     LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while 
     he sips a beer.  A television screen is featuring follow-up 
     coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in 
     the chunnel.  Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of 
     a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in 
     the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was 
     there were no other fatalaties.  There are intermittent 
     sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of 
     arrivals and departures.  ETHAN into shot.  He sits beside 
     LUTHER. 

                          LUTHER 
                Reach your folks? 
                     (ETHAN nods) 
                How they feeling? 

                          ETHAN
                About what? 

                          LUTHER 
                The official apology from the Justice 
                Department, the VIP treatment, you know, 
                the whole nine yards. 

                          ETHAN 
                Well my Mother was a little confused 
                about how the DEA could mistake her and 
                Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers 
                in the Florida keys. 

     LUTHER picks up his beer. 

                          LUTHER
                     (Laughs and with a British accent) 
                Cheers. 

     They drink. 

                          ETHAN
                Here's to  you, Luther. (clink glasses)  To 
                being off the disavowed list. 

                          LUTHER 
                Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! 

                          ETHAN
                You're more than that, Luther.  They were 
                mistaken about you and they're trying to 
                show you they know it.  They want you 
                back in. 

                          LUTHER
                Sure.  They want me back in so I won't 
                break in!  They still can't figure out 
                how we did it. 

                          ETHAN 
                You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? 

                          LUTHER 
                I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back 
                pay, give me a promotion, check out my 
                office at Langley and then, maybe, talk 
                about it. 

                          ETHAN 
                     (laughing) 
                It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? 

                          LUTHER 
                Why don't you come back with me? 

                          ETHAN 
                Just don't know why I'd be doing it. 

                          LUTHER 
                You really liked Phelps, didn't you? 

                          ETHAN 
                He was a good guy for a long, long time. 
                Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta 
                catch my flight..(rising) 
                So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen 
                again? 

                          LUTHER 
                Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss 
                being disreputable. 

                          ETHAN 
                Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any 
                better I'll always think of you that way. 

     The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no 
     more.  The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a 
     moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative 
     LUTHER looking after him. 

     INT. PLANE - NIGHT 

     ETHAN HUNT slumps down in his scat, dosing. A FLIGHT 
     ATTENDANT makes her way down the aisle, holding a case filled 
     with movie cassettes. She stops before a lady passenger. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you like to watch a movie, Miss 
                Clarke? 

     She then stops before ETHAN. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Excuse me, Mr. Hunt.  Would you like to
                watch a movie.

                          ETHAN
                No, thank you.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Would you consider the cinema of the 
                Caribbean? 

     ETHAN just stares at her.  This couldn't be what it's 
     sounding like. 

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
                Aruba, perhaps? 

     The camera moves into ETHAN's face.  They found him.  They 
     want him back.  He looks up at her and.....

     AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR
     THIS SOFT COPY.




     FADE IN:

     A WORN SATCHEL (MOVING - DAY)
    
     is being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black 
     armband.  VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH exits a gleaming building, pausing 
     for a moment, under a motto clearly visible above his head, 
     'Where the future is now'.  He checks the time.

     INSERT - WATCH

     set in Countdown Mode.  It's at 19 hours forty-seven minutes and 
     sixteen seconds and dropping, 19:37.15,  :14,  :13,  :12 etc.

     O.S. children are singing:

                Ring a ring a rosy/a pocketful of posy/
                a tissue a tissue/we all fall down.

     Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent 
     Natural History Museum.  They are moving in and around an odd
     freeform sculpture.

     POV - SCULPTURE AND CHILDREN

     a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, 
     almost like mirrors in a fun house.

     NEKHORVICH 

     wipes his eyes, a horn honks.  He looks toward the sound.

     MOVING SHOT - SATCHEL (INT. AIRPORT SECURITY - DAY)

     on the belt that takes it thru X-Ray.  On the other side a guard 
     opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal 
     items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small 
     plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, 
     hi-tech and at odds with the other items.  She pulls out an urn-
     shaped vessel.

                                GUARD
                What's this, then?

                                NEKHORVICH 
                        (handing her documents)
                The ashes of a colleague, I'm taking them
                to his family.  If you wish to open it,
                please be careful.

     COMPUTERIZED SCREEN DISPLAY (INT. PLANE - MOVING - DAY)

     on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight 
     point of departure in Sydney, continuously updating distance, 
     direction and time to its ultimate destination, Atlanta, Georgia.

                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                - folks, we're a little over two and a 
                half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but 
                if you look out your windows on either 
                side of the aircraft, we'll soon be 
                crossing the southern section of the Rocky 
                Mountains, a range which includes more 
                than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet.  
                The chain's loftiest point, Mount Elbert, 
                at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view 
                as we pass over central Colorado shortly..

     NEKHORVICH (INT. CABIN - DAY)

     seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance.  He  
     checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours 
     and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending 
     seconds whipping by.

     ETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat 
     beside Nekhorvich.

                                ETHAN
                You keep staring at that watch as if your
                life depended on it, Doctor..

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.

                                ETHAN
                They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be 
                with old friends.

                                NEKHORVICH 
                        (meaning Ethan)
                I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

                                ETHAN
                Sorry it couldn't be under happier 
                circumstances.

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm
                sorry..'
                        (bemused laughter, then looks at Ethan)
                - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.

     Nekhorvich is overcome.  Ethan puts a comforting hand on his  
     shoulder:

                                ETHAN
                He was quite a man.  Did he know before 
                the end you two had succeeded?

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Yes, he knew.  Just..

                                ETHAN
                ..not in time to save him.

                                NEKHORVICH 
                No.  After you've lived with Chimera for 
                twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not 
                even...Bellerophon.

     Nekhorvich pats the satchel.

                                ETHAN
                You carry them together?  Safely?

     With an almost impish grin and a wink:

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Yes, and you'll get us to a safe place 
                with them, thank god!..left to my own 
                devices, I'm an old fart too inept to read 
                a railroad timetable!..

     Good-natured laughter.  Cut off by a flight steward who passes 
     by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction. 
     Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling.  Passengers are 
     puzzled and alarmed.

                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                You Captain again.  We've experienced a 
                slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..
                
     A passenger struggling with his mask.  As Nekhorvich fumbles with 
     the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows 
     their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping.  He checks the 
     countdown time on his watch again.  Nekhorvich looks around him.  
     The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the 
     passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.

     INT - COCKPIT

     The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks.

                                CAPTAIN
                        (into radio)
                Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center.  This is 
                Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven, 747 
                heavy.  We are not reading you.  We're 
                unable to maintain cabin pressurization.  
                We have initiated a descent to one six
                thousand.

     The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands 
     slip off the controls.  His eyes flutter, then:

                                CO-PILOT
                Captain, I don't..can't..

     He passes out.  The Captain, HUGH STAMP, turns to verify that the
     relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls.

     He then removes his oxygen mask, sets the auto pilot, inputting 
     numbers to slow the plane and descend.  As the craft titles 
     downward...

     INT - GALLERY

     The flight attendants are pulling on jump suits.  Stamp emerges
     from the cockpit.

     INT - CABIN

     Ethan returns.  Nekhorvich beckons to him.  Ethan sits.  Grinning 
     around, Nekhorvich conspiratorially:

                                NEKHORVICH
                ..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.

                                ETHAN
                        (in the same tone)
                You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really 
                shouldn't.

     Nekhorvich's eyes narrow.

                                NEKHORVICH
                You're not Dmitri?

     With a lightning swift move Ethan breaks Nekhorvich's neck.

                                ETHAN
                - no.

     He grabs the satchel.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                        (to Wallis)
                Wallis, hold onto it.

     Wallis slashes the satchel handle open, takes the satchel for 
     Ambrose.  He peels off the latex mask, revealing SEAN AMBROSE.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Ulrich, pull the -

     He tears off the vocal oscillator at his adam's apple, clears his 
     throat, now as Ambrose:

                                AMBROSE
                - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..

                                STAMP
                        (the 'captain' into shot)
                All done, chief..

                                AMBROSE
                        (what else)
                - right -
                        (kidding)
                - don't go too far ahead of me now -

                                STAMP
                Not possible..

     Ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just 
     beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane.  Stamp pulls 
     back the panel, hops into the compartment below which is four 
     walls of electronic equipment.  Stamp kneels and slides back the 
     floor hatch.  The wind howls, puffs of cloud zip by beneath them.  
     As they descend into the belly:

                                WALLIS
                Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus 
                two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven-
                niner knots..

                                AMBROSE
                It's that time.  Go.

     They don goggles and, with Ambrose in the lead, 
     the team leaps, one after another from the hatch, sailing off
     into the sky.

     INT - COCKPIT (DAY)						

     An automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone:

                                VOICE
                Terrain, terrain.  Pull up, pull up.

     The co-pilot stirs.  He blearily rouses himself just in time to 
     see:

     A mountain rushing toward him.  As mountain meets airplane, the 
     frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the 
     fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, 
     which ignited, lights a fuse..

     The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:

     EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)

     For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the 
     plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle 
     widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from 
     than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the 
     midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at 
     least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of 
     a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan 
     climbs out of shot.

     WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)

     revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and 
     whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, 
     fluffy clouds overhead.

     Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds 
     he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears 
     relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's 
     holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost 
     expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on 
     the soundtrack.

     Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six 
     inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by 
     five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem 
     terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.

     It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close 
     just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.  
     Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, 
     as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when 
     its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his 
     climb.

     A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY)

     near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now 
     traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet 
     exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain 
     almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a 
     handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a 
     lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of 
     feet to oblivion.
                                
                                ETHAN
                Whoaa..

     He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.

     REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT

     with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the 
     summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who 
     favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To 
     lizard:

                                ETHAN
                You're welcome.

     The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back 
     attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the 
     beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo 
     streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now 
     ominously circling back.

     Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of 
     the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.

     The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has 
     opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.

     ETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES

     First, a retinal scan.

                                ELECTRONIC VOICE
                Identity confirmed.

                                SWANBECK
                Good morning, Mr. Hunt.

     Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen.  Over his introduction of Nyah 
     is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive 
     she never seems to give the camera a clean shot.

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE
                Your mission, should you choose to accept 
                it, requires you to recover a stolen item, 
                designated Chimera.  Essential to the 
                mission is the recruitment of a civilian -- 
                a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall.  She is a highly 
                capable professional thief currently 
                active in Spain.

     A series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i.e., warrants, complaints, 
     Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as 
     glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville.

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
                Her dossier's available on I-COM 3.  You 
                have 48 hours to recruit Ms. Nordoff-Hall 
                and meet me in Seville to receive further 
                details.  Should you or any member of your 
                IM force be caught or killed, the 
                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.

     Swanbeck's face reappears on screen:

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
                And Mr. Hunt - the next time you go on 
                vacation, please be good enough to let us 
                know where you're going.  This message will 
                self-destruct in five seconds.

     Ethan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space.

                                ETHAN
                If I let you know where I'm going -

     The glasses explode in a puff of smoke.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                - won't be on holiday.

     Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps 
     off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal 
     snit.  Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a 
     little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his 
     back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries 
     of flamenco dancers.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)

     Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving 
     guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, 
     exits her car and enters the villa.

     A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE)

     where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands 
     wielding the castanets.  The dancers perform on a raised platform 
     and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling 
     skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.

     REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN

     looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the 
     relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the 
     crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder 
     over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah 
     offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to 
     the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one 
     another.  Ethan approaches her.

                                ETHAN
                Do you know me?

                                NYAH
                No.  Should I?

                                ETHAN
                No.  You just looked as if you did.

                                NYAH
                No.  Just as if I'd like to.

                                ETHAN
                Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.

                                NYAH
                Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -

                                ETHAN
                There's not enough time in the world for 
                any of it to be bad.

     This stops her.  Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose 
     to nose.  Whispered but breezy:

                                NYAH
                Look, it's either you or the rent and I 
                don't mind telling you it's not an easy 
                choice.

                                ETHAN
                What if I pay the rent?

                                NYAH
                Uh-huh.

                                ETHAN
                Uh-huh?

     Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink 
     then:

                                NYAH
                Go find the wealthy lady you came with and 
                next time we meet - I'll pay your rent. 
                        (kissing him, sweetly)
                Now bugger off.

     And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated 
     desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of 
     the dancer's steps to cover her own.  Once upstairs, a security 
     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
     down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to 
     Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the 
     windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.  
     In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard 
     can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the 
     hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out 
     of shot.

     INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)

     Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.

     INT - BATH (EVE)

     A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored 
     walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         
     chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of 
     ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and 
     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to 
     its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, 
     revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds 
     it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from 
     green thru yellow and into red.

                                NYAH
                        (her fondest hopes confirmed)
                Mmmm.

     She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the 
     tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any 
     cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she 
     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing 
     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.  
     She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.

     There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble 
     casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of 
     relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself 
     looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked 
     compartments.  As she studies them:

                                ETHAN
                Decisions, decisions.

     Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom 
     mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.

                                NYAH
                What are you doing here?

                                ETHAN
                Think you're the only one who can pick a 
                lock?

                                NYAH
                        (not altogether pleased)
                I see.  You're not just another pretty face..

     Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the 
     bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Oh god.  A bloody baritone.

     Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.  
     She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the 
     tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they're nose to 
     nose.
                                
                                ETHAN
                I take it you prefer tenors.

     She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR 
     AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's 
     changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He 
     breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and 
     disappears from the dressing room mirror.

                                NYAH
                Would you mind if I'm on top?

                                ETHAN
                Oh, either way works for me.

     With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins 
     working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque 
     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara 
     brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues 
     working with the pick and wrench.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                You're never gonna find it there.

                                NYAH
                        (she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)
                Damn it!  Find what?

                                ETHAN
                His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes 
                up for auction Tuesday.

     Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:

     LOOKING UP

     more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against 
     the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's 
     lower pelvic region as she straddles him.  Not exactly in the mood 
     to move:

     She stiffens - he knows too damn much.

                                NYAH
                - right..where is it?

                                ETHAN
                Far right. 

     She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
     bottom right compartment.  She's utterly nonplussed:

                                NYAH
                Where's the bloody -

                                ETHAN
                        (plucking it off his chest,
                        offering it up like a mechanic
                        under the chassis)
                - torque wrench.

                                NYAH
                - this is very disconerting..

                                ETHAN
                Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm
                told.

                                NYAH
                - right..

     She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque
     wrench and carbide pick - and it's open.  She withdraws a velvet
     pouch and opens the pouch.  Out spills the spectacular necklace.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Lovely.
                        (starting to close the safe)
                Who are you and what's it going to cost me?

                                ETHAN
                        (having sat up)
                I wouldn't do that.

                                NYAH
                Do what?

     The alarm goes off.

                                ETHAN
                That.

     The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn
     Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in.

                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
                Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you!
                        (in Spanish to security guards,
                        annoyed)
                It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer.

                                ETHAN
                Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is
                that the heat sensors were activated.   But
                Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate -

     Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.

                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
                Mucho gusto, senorita.

                                ETHAN
                - did feel that she had rather too long to
                work on the safe before they triggered the
                alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall?

                                NYAH
                Oh yes.  Absolutely.  Much too long I
                should yes.

     Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary,
     intensified curiosity - about Ethan.

                                ETHAN
                Under the circumstances I think we would
                recommend re-setting the senors to
                respond to a lighter load.  How do you
                feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?

                                NYAH
                Indeed.

                                ETHAN
                Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason 
                to disrupt your party any longer.  we have
                some further concerns about the disposition
                of your security guards, which you'll
                receive in our written report by fax in the
                morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?

     He offers Nyah his arm.  They start out.  Ethan immediately stops.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten
                something?

     Nyah looking genuinely puzzled.

                                NYAH
                The necklace?

     Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering
     string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.

                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
                        (a great kidder)
                What are you trying to do, senorita?  Rob
                me.

     They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door.

     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)

     The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.  Ethan and Nyah
     emerge from the villa, walking slowly.  Nyah's clearly
     preoccupied.

                                NYAH
                I'm missing something here, aside from a
                500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I
                botched the job, I could've walked out of 
                there with the bloody thing.

                                ETHAN
                At least you walked.

                                NYAH
                If you weren't going to let me get away
                with it, why did you let me go thru with
                it?

                                ETHAN
                Wanted to see how good you were.
                I'm hoping we might work together.

                                NYAH
                May I say something, no offence?  You
                look like a gigolo, you sound like a 
                thief, you act like a cop - what the
                bloody hell do you have in mind?

                                ETHAN
                Working under adverse conditions.  Highly
                adverse conditions.

                                NYAH
                Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi
                carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You
                couldn't possibly want me off tonight's
                performance..

                                ETHAN
                You didn't do that badly.

     Her car arrives.

                                NYAH
                        (as she moves to her car)
                You're apologizing for me?  Quite the
                gentleman..

                                ETHAN
                        (opening the car door)
                Not really.  I triggered the alarm..

     One foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to Ethan.

                                ETHAN
                Hey, the Bulgari job last week was
                flawless.  And I've always been partial to
                pale yellows.

     She slides behind the wheel.

                                NYAH
                        (as he leads on the car)
                I don't do laundry, or put up with
                cheeky bastards who set me up on their
                territory so they can poach on mine.

     She takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake.
     Ethan smiles and shakes his head.

     ON THE ROAD - NYAH (MOVING)

     around curves, hair flying, she's free.  Her car phone rings.
     Perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up:

                                NYAH
                        (tentatively)
                Hola..

                                ETHAN
                Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?

                                NYAH
                Where did you get this number?  I don't
                even have it!

                                ETHAN' VOICE
                Would you like it?

     She hits the End button and disconnects.  The phone immediately
     rings again.  She refuses to pick up.  Ethan pulls alongside hers.
     She looks at him.  They speak through the open cars.

                                ETHAN
                Pull over and listen to me, will you?
                Just listen..

                                NYAH
                Listen to what?

                                ETHAN
                I need your help and I thin you can use
                mine.

                                NYAH
                Your help?  What are you talking about?

                                ETHAN
                Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch
                authority.  I can make them go away.

                                NYAH
                Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.

     She floors it and shoots ahead of Ethan, nicking his car as she takes off.

                                ETHAN
                        (to himself)
                I deserved that.

     SERIES OF DRIVING SHOTS - NYAH AND ETHAN

     Ethan rings her again.  And keeps ringing.  Her face becomes
     grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethan's
     pursuit progressively more determined.  They are reaching the
     limits of adhesion around blind curves.

     MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)

     The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin
     turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of
     marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.

     Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in
     this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank
     and sees on his GPS what Nyah can't see thru the fog - 
     less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly
     negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of
     feet to rock and sea below.  Ringing her number again:

                                ETHAN
                        (half to himself)
                Slow down, slow down.

     She turns up a mound and loses control.  She spins out and heads
     toward the edge of the cliff.

                                NYAH
                        (realizing she's in trouble)
                Uh-oh.

     Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin.
     Her car stops just at the cliff's edge.

     Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.

                                ETHAN
                No!

     Suddenly there's no Nyah.  Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and
     sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet
     below, holding the door handle.

                                NYAH
                Oh..oh..

     Taking a firm grip on her wrist.

                                ETHAN
                Don't look down.  Just..look at me.
                That's it..that's it..

     He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into
     his arms.  For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.  Then:
        
                                NYAH
                What's you name?

                                ETHAN
                Ethan Hunt.

                                NYAH
                Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to
                talk to me about?

     Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.  Her dark eyes
     suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.

                                ETHAN
                ...more than I thought..
                
     They scarcely to move to bring their lips together:

                                NYAH
                Awfully short notice..

                                ETHAN
                Care to wait a decent interval?

                                NYAH
                Who wants to be decent?..

     DISSOLVE:

     CLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE)

     sleeping.  His eyes open slowly.  He comes to full consciousness,
     his head still on the pillow.  Something approaching serious
     anxiety informs his features.  He lifts his head and looks at his
     left, angle widening.  Nyah lies on her side facing him,        
     sleeping serenely.  Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't-
     approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed.  He lets his head flop
     back on the pillow.  Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to-
     profile.  As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced
     by curiosity and even wonder.  He lifts his hand and just
     brushes her cheek.  Her eyes open.  She knows where she is.

                                ETHAN
                So what've you got against spooks?

     Nyah smiles.

                                NYAH
                When they've got your recruiting
                technique?  Not a thing.

                                ETHAN
                Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.

                                NYAH
                They've got a book for this?

                                ETHAN
                They've got a book for everything.

                                NYAH
                The only other spook I knew was a liar.
                Charming but absolutely incapable of
                telling the truth.  He'd lie about his
                favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an
                occupational hazard.  All spies really do
                is conceal the truth and tell lies.

                                ETHAN
                Not revealing information doesn't
                necessarily make someone a liar.

                                NYAH
                That's not the point.  In the end what
                spies rely on is the one thing they think
                they know that you don't.

                                ETHAN
                Which is?

                                NYAH
                That they're lying.

     Ethan laughs.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                ..once they know that they can
                get very very..crosee..

     Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan.

                                ETHAN
                So where did I got right?

                                NYAH
                You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully
                good one..
                        (then)
                ..this thing these blokes pinched..

                                ETHAN
                I don't know that they 'pinched' it.
                Don't even know that they're blokes.

     Nyah stops to think about this.

                                NYAH
                Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume
                I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to
                catch-a-thief..

                                ETHAN
                So do I.  Sort of.

     Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.

                                NYAH
                Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?

                                ETHAN
                Of what?

     Nyah laughs.

                                NYAH
                Ask a question, you get an answer!..

                                ETHAN
                Damn, you're beautiful.

                                NYAH
                That's because I'm on my back.

     Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down
     at him.

                                ETHAN
                I don't think so.

     She sinks into his arms.

     EXT-INT - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)

     Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his
     way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema
     portion of the Fallas de Valencia.  On this night great papier
     mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the
     city and torched in great bonfires.  Outside the bar Ethan's
     looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and
     flowers.  He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going 
     to buy some flowers.

     He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be
     seen on the petals.  Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar,
     and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.
     Turns back to the vendor.

                                ETHAN
                Are you gonna be here a while?

                                VENDOR
                Si, senor.

                                ETHAN
                I'll pick'em up on my way out, okay?

     Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where
     he passes security at a pair of double doors.

     INT - IMF BRIEFING ROOM

     Swanbeck stands looking out the window.  Noisy crowds from the
     festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the
     first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid
     background thru briefing room's window.

                                SWANBECK
                Fetival's a pain in the ass.  Honoring
                saint by setting'em on fire.
                        (turning to Ethan)
                Sit down, sit down.

     Ethan sits.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Let's you know what they think of saints,
                doesn't it?  Damn near set me on fire on
                my way over here.  As if I haven't been
                burned enough today.

     A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is
     going to blow between these two.  Then civilly:

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Sorry I barged in on your vacation.

                                ETHAN
                Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.

                                SWANBECK
                Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.

                                ETHAN
                Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.

                                SWANBECK
                Why did you phrase it like that?

                                ETHAN
                Like what?

                                SWANBECK
                'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

                                ETHAN
                You gotta be kidding.

     Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD, and
     projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is:

     VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH

                                NEKHORVICH
                        (with exaggerate brio)
                Well, Dmitri!  How are you?..

     Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply.  Ethan smiles.

                                ETHAN
                ..I'm fine..and you?

                                NEKHORVICH
                I'm fine..

     Ethan laughs.

                                ETHAN
                I'm fine and you're fine..

     With Ethan simultaneously whispering:

                                NEKHORVICH
                I'm fine too.. I'm fine and you're fine - do
                you remember, dear fried, how you got
                Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr.
                Strangelove and we gave you the name of that 
                silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know
                your name?..In those days, you not only
                saved our lives, you saved our sanity.  'Now,
                then Dmitri - we have this little problem':
                Every search for a hero must begin with
                something that every hero requires; a 
                villain.  Therefore, in a search for our
                hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster
                Chimera.  I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney
                and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.
                However we travel, I must arrive at me
                destination, within 20 hours of departure.
                Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for
                now prudence dictates that I communicate
                nothing but the gravest urgency.
                I fear I can entrust this to no one but
                you, Dmitri.  as we say, 'I'm sorry and
                you're sorry'..

     Swanbeck stops the DVD.

                                SWANBECK
                Let me ask you something.  You have any
                idea what the hell he's talking about?

     Ethan smiles.

                                ETHAN
                An idea, yeah.

                                SWANBECK
                Like?

                                ETHAN
                Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a
                hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a
                commercial carrier.  So let's get on with
                it.  He's still in Sydney?

                                SWANBECK
                Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his
                colleague, Gradski, but that happened
                earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight
                from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..

     Ethan sits back, heavily.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                - Hunt, are you listening?..

     Slowly looking up:

                                ETHAN
                If he didn't want to go anywhere without
                me, how did you get him on the flight?

                                SWANBECK
                You were there.

     Swanbeck clears his throat.  He turns back to the computer and 
     punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.  File open to computer scans
     of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and
     comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat,
     as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy
     scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image.

     ETHAN

     slowly looks up at Swanbeck.

                                SWANBECK
                When I couldn't find you, I had to replace
                you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.
                He double you, what?  Two, three times?

                                ETHAN
                Twice.

                                SWANBECK
                What did you think of him?

                                ETHAN 
                You know we had reservations about each
                other.  Isn't it a little late in the day
                to be asking me that?

                                SWANBECK
                Not necessarily.

     Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain.

                                SWANBECK
                Airline record list Captain Harold
                Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.  as
                far as the media and all governmental
                agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh
                died on the flight, but in fact he missed
                it.  He did, however make the next flight -
                in cargo, stuffed into a rather small 
                suitcase considering his size.

     Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially
     obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Someone on that flight planned an
                operation designed to down the plane and
                make it look like an accident.  Someone
                skillful enough to bring the whole thing
                off without a hitch but - they don't
                always get your luggage on the plane, even
                when you fly first class.

                                ETHAN
                So there's one thing we know Ambrose
                doesn't.

                                SWANBECK
                Then you do think it was Ambrose.

     Ethan barely nods.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                And you're not surprised.

     Ethan gives Swanbeck a look.

                                ETHAN
                Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean
                wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
                that he took it.

                                SWANBECK
                Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
                innocent passengers?

     Ethan smiles.

                                ETHAN
                Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
                he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

                                SWANBECK
                The question is why?  What was this
                Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?

     Ethan rises and moves to the window.

                                ETHAN
                Right now only Ambrose knows that.

                                SWANBECK
                In any case, you've got to recover Chimera
                and bring it to us.

                                ETHAN
                In order to do that, I've got to figure
                out how he plans to make money with it.

                                SWANBECK
                - right.  In fact since the plane went
                down our banking sources have confirmed a
                marked increase in the stock pilling of
                cash in terrorists accounts.

                                ETHAN
                'Terrorists?'

                                SWANBECK
                Well you know Nekhorvich's history.
                You're the one who got him out of the
                Soviet Union was it still in bio-
                weapon business.

                                ETHAN
                If that's what you're thinking Ambrose
                would have set up a bidding situation with
                any number of buyers before he got on the
                plane.  Locating him in time to stop
                something like that - 

                                SWANBECK
                - is where Miss Hall comes in.

                                ETHAN
                        (blindsided)
                Excuse me?

                                SWANBECK
                Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
                which he took very seriously.  She walked
                away and he's wanting her back ever
                since.  We believe she's our surest and 
                quickest way of location him.

                                ETHAN
                        (acidly)
                And then what?

                                SWANBECK
                Then makes sure she continues to see him.
                Gets him confide in her and report to
                you.

                                ETHAN
                You made it sound as if I was recruiting
                her for her skills as a thief.

                                SWANBECK
                Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the 
                wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking
                her to resume a prior relationship, not do 
                anything she hasn't already done.

                                ETHAN
                She's got no training for this kind of
                thing.

                                SWANBECK
                Go to bed with a man and lie to him?
                She's a woman.  She's got all the training
                she needs.

     Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.

                                ETHAN
                I don't think I can get her to do it.

                                SWANBECK
                You mean it'll be difficult.

                                ETHAN
                Very.

                                SWANBECK
                Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt.
                It's mission impossible.  Difficult should
                be a walk in the park for you.  If you can
                think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose,
                you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you
                might want to take a look at these..if you
                have any further qualms about getting her
                to do the job.

     He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the
     one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security).  Swanbeck sets it on
     the table.  Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.

     EXT - BAR (NIGHT)

     A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever
     more lively crowd.  as he does:

                                STREET VENDOR
                Senor, senor!  Your flowers.

     The vendor holds up the spring bouquet.  Ethan seems genuinely
     surprised by them.

                                ETHAN
                Yes.  They're very nice..

     And he's lost in the crowd, leaving a very puzzled vendor holding
     the bouquet.

     STILL OF CRASH SITE IN ROCKIES (THRU MINOLTA STILL CAMERA)

     One after the other flashing by.  They are more evocative than
     specific in their suggestion of an abrupt, fiery, ending, where
     the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart
     and strewn over a desolate landscape.

     NYAH

     carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee
     table.  She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the
     lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto
     the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of
     champagne chilling.  There's a light breeze the fire from the
     burning effigies throwing smoke and flame all over the city.

                                NYAH
                What's the population of Seville any
                idea?

                                ETHAN
                Five, six-hundred thousand.

                                NYAH
                There's nearly 2 million in London.

                                ETHAN
                And six billion in the world.

                                NYAH
                That's lot of people out there..how many
                of them, I wonder, are capable of
                something like that?

                                ETHAN
                Sean Ambrose, for one.

     A long shocked moment.  Nyah laughs.

                                NYAH
                Right...

     INT - SAFEHOUSE (EVE - LATER)

     The pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room
     Nyah's back to Ethan:

                                NYAH
                        (grimly amused)
                Not that it matter much but..I seem to
                recall you staying something like, 'I was
                hoping we could work together.'

                                ETHAN
                This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.

                                NYAH
                But it is what you'd like me to do.
                so tell me to do it..

     She approaches Ethan.  They're inches apart.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Come on, out with it.  Tell me to go and
                insinuate myself back into Sean's life.

                                ETHAN
                Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's
                life.

                                NYAH
                I'd like a little more conviction..

                                ETHAN
                So would I.  But it's not mine to give.

                                NYAH
                        (archness there)
                You've either got it or you don't.  Let
                your conscience be your guide?

                                ETHAN
                Something like that.

     With a smile and a wink.

                                NYAH
                But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a
                bloody thief.

                                ETHAN
                You can be a thief and have a conscience.

                                NYAH
                No.  You can be a thief and have a
                conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to
                tell me about this!
                        (pouring herself a drink)
                What do I have to do to get away from this
                guy?  When you're with him, he messes
                about with your head every waking
                moment..even now I'll be at some out-of-
                the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a 
                bottle of Crystal shows up at the table,

                out at any given moment where I am in the
                world but he does.  And it looks like he's
                done it again.  You know his definition of
                a  true paranoid?

                                ETHAN
                I don't.

                                NYAH
                Someone in possession of all the facts.
                        (she turns away, pauses)
                Are you telling me I have to do this?

                                ETHAN
                Generally, I don't favor coercing someone.
                Not when there's a chance my life could
                end up in their hands.

                                NYAH
                And that's the only reason?

                                ETHAN
                Can you think of a better one?

                                NYAH
                Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or
                that..somehow in the course of business
                this got personal as well as physical.

                                ETHAN
                Look, would it make you feel better if I
                didn't want you to do this?

                                NYAH
                Much.

                                ETHAN
                Then feel better!..

     Long moment while she looks at him.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Well.  That made all the difference in the 
                world, didn't it?

     Ethan walks out onto the balcony.  She looks at his back.

                                NYAH
                Sean will never be anything but suspicious
                if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm-
                not-nad' message.  Not after the way we
                broke up.

                                ETHAN
                What wouldn't make him suspicious?

                                NYAH
                Probably that I needed him in some urgent
                way..destitute - in serious trouble..the
                kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..

     Ethan's been smiling slightly.

                                ETHAN
                Serious trouble, Nyah, is something I can
                always arrange..

     Hall, apprehended March 13 in Seville, is awaiting extradition
     while the authorities in London, Paris, and Amsterdam squabble
     over where she's going to be tried first, for the various thefts
     and burglaries she's committed in the three cities.

     Ambrose picking up on a version of the Interpol bulletin Ethan's

     he were watching...

                Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but
                I guarantee he's monitoring every law 
                enforcement agency in the world, for what
                they might be saying about him, if nothing
                else - he's got the ability and, we
                assume, the desire to get you out of
                there.

                This doesn't seem to be accomplishing
                much.

                                ETHAN
                Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is
                keeping a very capable thief off the
                street..

                                NYAH
                Very funny..maybe he has heard and
                doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost
                interest.

                purse..kneel down..

     She does.  They're effectively blocked from the street.

                How can you possibly?  I've got to get

                                ETHAN
                You don't trust me.

                                NYAH
                Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor
                judge of character.

                                ETHAN
                He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's

                Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll
                take care of myself because if push comes
                to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without
                giving two week notice.

                                ETHAN

     They rise.  A quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone.  A look of
     something like longing replaces the toughness as she gazes after
     him, then starts across the street toward the limo and driver.  MI

     pans of sheep are bleating and looking for sort of cover in

     EXT - COPTER (DAY)

     Billy and Luther emerge, Luther with computer looking acutely
     uncomfortable in a wrinkled suit.

                Welcome to Australia, mate.

     They look up to a smiling Ethan who points to the ground beneath
     Luther's feet.  Luther looks down to see that he is standing in a
     pile of sheep-shit.

                                LUTHER
                Thanks - mate.

     Both men laugh and all three move to:

                Yeah, I've heard about you, Luther, and I
                just want to tell you it's an honor and a
                pleasure to be working with you blokes,
                whoaa!  That's some transponder!

     As Billy speaks, the visual come on line and Nyah has become
     visible.

                                LUTHER
                        (a jaundiced eye, to Ethan)
                It certainly is.  How did we get so lucky?

     Ethan pointedly ignore the question.

     rounding the tip of the bay's crescent, revealing the beach and
     dock at Ambrose's palm-lined residence.

     stricken.

     POV NYAH (MOVING)

     as the piling besides which it stands.  But the features remain
     obscured by the sun at his back.

                                BILLY 
                        (to Ethan)
                Is it him, then?

     POV - MOVING

     The tide is too low for the boat to dock, making it necessary for
     he boat to approach the shore.  The slender figure moves off the
     end of the dock and onto the beach.

     THE CIGARETTE

     idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the
     sand - the boatman grumbles he can't get any closer.  The slender
     figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light
     changes - Ambrose is waiting.

     Nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side
     into thigh-high water without taking her eyes off Ambrose.
     Ambrose strides right on into the bay.  as they are just an arm's
     length apart:

     THE SIGNALS AND PHOTOS

     start to bounce back, growing larger and larger on the screen,
     until:  Nyah can be seen, water up to her thighs, lingering in
     Ambrose's arms with each blow-up, and linger.  And lingering.

                                BILLY
                - right.  Now there's a bloke who knows
                how to deliver a proper welcome.  Don't
                get me wrong, mate.  You were quite
                hospitable.  Is it him, then?

     Ethan's look suggests he's worried about lapse in recruiting
     judgment.

                                LUTHER
                It is, Billy.

                                BILLY
                Then we got'em!

                                ETHAN
                We don't know what we've got because we
                don't know what he's got, where he's got
                it or what he's doing in Sydney with it.

     Ethan strides away from the screen, the edge in his voice and the 
     move not altogether lost on either Luther or Billy.

     Ethan watches the Nekhorvich video on the computer screen.

                                NEKHORVICH
                ...therefore in a search for our hero,
                Bellerophon, we created a monster,
                Chimera.

     Ethan then flips through a series of pictures on the computer
     depicting the myth of Bellerophon attacking Chimera.

     Billy moves up behind him.

     INT - AMBROSE'S (DAY)

     They've reached the head of the stairs.  Ambrose opens a door.
     It's a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the
     tent annex and the beach, and a very large bed.

                                NYAH
                Your room.

                                AMBROSE
                        (yes)
                Mmmm.

                                NYAH
                And my room?

     A long moment.  Ambrose walks to a mirrored wall.  The mirrors
     are sliding doors.  With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the
     mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer
     clothes.

                                AMBROSE
                Thought you could use a little something
                to wear.

     Nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe.  Ambrose pulls out a
     slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed.

                                AMBROSE ( cont'd)
                Try it on..

     Nyah hesitates.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Go ahead.  I'm dying to see if I 
                remembered your size..

     Nyah picks it up.

                                NYAH
                No changing room?

     Ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits.  Her blouse,
     belt, skirt, fall on the bed.  As her slender arm reaches down to
     pick up the Armani:

     AMBROSE

     grips her wrist, the flimsy Armani dangling in the air.

     CLOSE - NYAH

     meeting Ambrose's look.

                                NYAH
                You're not interested in seeing how it
                looks.

                                AMBROSE
                Oh, I am.  Later..

     The Armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor.

     CLOSE - ETHAN (DUSK)

     standing off to one side, listening to Nekhorvich's voice.

                                NEKHORVICH
                ..therefore in a search for our hero,
                Bellerophon, we created a monster,
                Chimera.

                                LUTHER
                Why's Nekhorvich going on about an old Greek myth?

                                ETHAN
                Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA
                molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed
                Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head
                of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
                plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich
                has created a monster virus in Chimera and 
                apparently the means to kill it in
                Bellerophon.

                                LUTHER
                That simple, huh?

                                ETHAN
                Why not?

     CLOSE - NYAH (INT. AMBROSE BEDROOM - DUSK)

     lying back on a pillow, looking and off into space to right
     off camera.  She hears Ambrose's voice, with Ethan's voice

                                AMBROSE'S VOICE/ETHAN'S VOICE
                Damn, you're beautiful..

     Nyah reacts as if she'd been rapped on the nose, her eyes
     moist.  She turns abruptly to camera.

                                NYAH
                Did you say something?

     AMBROSE

     leaning on an elbow, looking down.

                                AMBROSE
                I said you're beautiful, Nyah.

                                NYAH
                Only because..it's spring..chalk it up
                        (looking him dead in the eye)
                - to spring fever.

     Ambrose, amused, lights a cigarette and inhaling:

                                AMBROSE
                Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's
                nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's

                Right.  I guess there aren't many flu
                epidemics in the middle of summer.

     Luther resumes working on his computer and sees Ethan is locked
     on Ambrose's compound on his computer screen, thinking of Nyah.
        
                                LUTHER (cont'd)
                She did it, Ethan.  Nyah's in the

                Yeah?  I've just rolled up a snowball and
                tosses it into hell.

     Ethan stands.

     OUTSIDE THE SHEEP FARM SAFEHOUSE

     A brooding Ethan exits the sheep farm safehouse under a setting
     sun.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                Now we'll see what chance it has.

     Ethan stops, looking out over the broken plain.  His voice is
     heard overlapping into the next scene.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
                        (softly)
                Damn, You're beautiful.

     CLOSE - NYAH (NIGHT)

     lying in bed, obviously hearing Ethan's voice again, and feeling
     very much alone.  She stares out into the night, a gaze that in
     its bemused intensity is an exact match to Ethan's.

     FADE:

     CLOSE - PHOTO - HONG KONG TIMES (INT. AMBROSE STUDY - EARLY DAWN)

     its front page, except for the headlines and date, covered with
     stacks of paper money, banded bundled dollars piled high as a
     cord of wood.  The amount $24 millions is written in ink over the
     money.

                                AMBROSE
                Twenty-four mil..

     Ambrose's hands shift to another photo of another newspaper, the
     LONDON TIMES, this one piled high with English pounds and the
     written amount: 37 million pounds.

                                AMBROSE'S VOICE
                Thirty-seven million pounds.  That's a
                promising bid.

     The third photo is of the AFTERNOON ARUBAN, with $14 million
     packaged on it.

     Ambrose, wearing a robe and seated at a glass-topped table, sets
     this last photo on the table on top the others.  He picks up
     Nekhorvich's digital camera, removes the film disk, and snaps it
     into its plastic case. He places the case into an envelope
     (NOTE: The same envelope seen at the track) and hands it to
     Stamp.

                                AMBROSE
                We'll need this at the track.  Well then.
                Sorted.

     Stamp is seated near him.  Glances toward Ambrose's bedroom and
     Nyah asleep in Ambrose's bed.

                                STAMP 
                        (pointedly)
                Not everything.  Why do you think she's

                                AMBROSE
                From her point of view or mine?

                                STAMP
                Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she
                left you six months ago..The question is,
                do you trust her?     

     As he speaks, Ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his
     robe.  Takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the
     cigar; the razor-sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar 
     like a guillotine.

                                AMBROSE
                One considers her timing, of course -
                getting nicked within a week of the plane
                going down.  Suggestive, even borderline
                suspicious, but hardly conclusive.

                                STAMP
                Well, you've thorough about it, at any
                rate.

     Ambrose opens the cutter again to clean off the fragments of
     tobacco trapped by the cut.

                                AMBROSE
                Tell me, Hugh.  You don't exactly hang on
                Nyah's every word and gesture, do you?
                Fairly ratty nail, that.

     Sean touches the nail of Stamp's left pinkie finger.  Stamp
     reacts by slightly withdrawing his hand.

                                STAMP 
                Sean..

     With his left hand Ambrose grabs Stamp's left wrist.

                                AMBROSE
                You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug 
                for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?

                                STAMP
                Sean, please..

     Sean pulls Stamp's hand closer.

                                AMBROSE
                Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse
                sent in by IMF to spy in us, why should I
                deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two?
                Or don't you think I can learn more from
                her than she can from me?

     Ambrose twists Stamp's wrist so that Stamp drops to one knee
     trying to alleviate the pain.

                                STAMP
                        (in pain)
                I do!..

     Ambrose leans in close to Stamp's face as he places the cutter
     around Stamp's pinkie.

                                AMBROSE
                Now Hugh, you must realize that some of us
                have the burden of sex to deal with..and
                my dear chap.  I may or may not know why 
                she thinks she's here, but I'm willing to
                take the risk, because Hugh, I am gaging
                for it..

     Ambrose closes the cutter on Stamp's finger and cuts the nail,
     just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood.  Stamp
     cries out.  Ambrose tosses Stamp a napkin, light his cigar and
     exhale.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Don't ever question my judgment again.

     EMPTY FRAME (EXT. RANDWICK RACE TRACK - DAY)

     with no sound, the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until
     horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the
     sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting and gasping for
     jostling and going to the whip, the sound of the crowd
     overwhelming all but the announcer's voice carrying everyone
     around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing,
     controlled frenzy.

     fourth race.  Taped onto 'Naturally Vain' is a small plastic
     piece with the note.  she regards the note, places the plastic
     piece in her ear.

                At the mounting enclosure, just off the

     THRU BINOCULARS - NYAH'S POV - MOVING

     thru the crowd onto the track over to the pre-post paddock where
     an animated gaggle of owners, heavy batters and investerace touts
     surround it.  Only Ethan is stock still - and looking up at Nyah.

     CLOSE - NYAH

     a swift intake of breath as she see him.

                                ETHAN
                How's it going?  Everything okay?

                                NYAH
                Just like old times.

                                ETHAN
                Just like old times?

                                NYAH
                Just about..

     She appears to be the picture of unruffled sang-froid.

                                ETHAN
                Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's.

     ETHAN'S POV (THRU GLASSES)

     moving from Nyah to the champagne bar just behind where Ambrose
     is seen greeting someone in the crowd and they sit at a corner
     table in front of the window overlooking the track.

                                NYAH
                        (a breath, then:)
                Near as I can tell, there's at least a
                half-dozen other blokes about the place.
                Maybe more.  Hugh Stamp, an old mate of
                Sean's, is the only one I recognize, bit
                of a creep and then some..

     POV ETHAN

     Stamp, stands a pillar, his finger bandages, looking
     glum and looking down at Nyah.

                                ETHAN
                We know him.  He's over your left
                shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..

                                NYAH
                - Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to
                me.  Then there's the blokes in the
                annex at the back of the house.

                                ETHAN
                Have you met them?

                                NYAH
                Annex is strictly off limits to me and
                they never come to the main house,
                Michael even takes their meals to them
                all but shoves them under the door.

                I've no doubt.

     ETHAN'S POV MONOCULAR VIDEO RANGE FINDER

     of Ambrose sitting with someone whose face is obscured from his
     angle by bar patrons.

     BILLY

     is also looking.

     POV RANGE FINDER BILLY

     and from his point of view it can be seen that Ambrose is talking
     with John McCloy, the head Biocyte.  Ambrose takes an envelope
     out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small
     plastic container marked 'S.G.' (Identical to the object first
     seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security.)  He opens it
     and removes a small shiny object about the size of a quarter.  He
     turns to the window and gestures.  Stamp enters the bar.

                                BILLY
                Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar.
                Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into
                something.

     ETHAN'S POV

                                ETHAN
                I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte
                CEO.

                Yep.

                                NYAH
                Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with
                loads of money piled on them -- thirty-
                seven million on the London Times.  What's
                that about?

                                ETHAN
                Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to
                prove that as of the date on the newspaper
                those bids are back up by earnest money --

     INT - VAN - LUTHER

     is monitoring both cameras.  All see Ambrose give the little
     wafer-like object to Stamp who places it in a small camera, hands
     it back to Ambrose and exits, waiting just outside the glass
     door.  Ambrose hands the camera to McCloy who looks puzzled.

                                LUTHER
                Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how
                to use a digital camera..

     McCloy puts it to his eye, fumbles, then with Ambrose's
     direction:
                                
                                ETHAN
                Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not
                happy about.

     McCloy puts the camera down.  The two men have words.  McCloy
     shakily leave the table.  Ambrose opens the camera.

                                LUTHER
                Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of
                the digital camera and put it into an
                envelope, put it in his inner left jacket
                pocket...

                Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an

                -- his left jacket pocket.

                Affirmative.

     AMBROSE

     passes by Stamp on his way back, hands him the camera.

                Betting table twelve off the paddock.
                Nyah, are you up to this?

                                NYAH
                I'll muddle through.

     WIDE ANGLE - BLEACHER (DAY)

     Ambrose arriving with a pair of drinks.  Nyah rises.

                                AMBROSE
                See anything you like?

                                NYAH
                Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about
                to close the betting table and I haven't a
                sou..

     While Ambrose is still juggling the drinks, Nyah reaches into his
     trouser pockets, and rummages around.

                                AMBROSE
                        (laughing)
                Nyah!

                                ETHAN
                Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.

                                BILLY
                No worries, mate.

     She pulls out a fifty-dollar note.

                                NYAH
                Would you mind terribly?

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                        (amused and turned on)
                - not at all.  But you'll pay for that
                and with interest..

                                NYAH
                I've no doubt..

     She heads up the stairs.

                                AMBROSE
                        (reaching into his pocket for
                        money)
                Hold on.

     Ambrose grabs her arm, and she almost drops the envelope she's
     just lifted.  (NOTE: It is important not to see her actually lift
     it).  She's holding it, pinned between her right arm and side.  As
     it's slipping, she notes Stamp above her, looking down and has to
     conceal what she's holding from him as well:

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Put down a couple of hundred for.

                                NYAH
                To win?

                                AMBROSE
                What else?

     She takes it and as she does the envelope falls, but she manages
     to catch it with her left hand, blocking the move with her body
     as she does.

                to transmit.  Betting table twelve.

     EXT - VAN (DAY)

     designated as NEW SOUTH WALES DELIVERIES, 'anytime, anywhere.'
     Luther bursts out of the van, carrying the tiny camera and begins
     to thread his way thru cars and foot traffic.

     BILLY

     in dramatic contrast ambles at a conspicuously leisurely pace.

     NYAH

     passes Stamp, not seeing him standing just a row above, blocked
     from her by one of the pillars.  Stamp idly regards her and then 
     decides: he follows.

     LUTHER

     perspiring, approaches the betting table thru the last of the
     parked cars.

     STAMP

     approaches the door thru which Nyah had gone and starts to open
     it - only to have the door slammed in his face and on his
     bandaged finger by Billy, in a track usher's uniforms.

                                BILLY
                        (very solicitous)
                Sorry about that, mate, that must've
                really - aggrhh!..

     Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds
     himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.  If he'd been welded
     there by a band of steal he'd have more room to maneuver.

                                STAMP
                Say again?

                                BILLY
                Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh...

                                STAMP
                Whatever you're about in future, watch
                your step.  Never know who you might run
                into...

     Stamp looks around, Nyah's nowhere in sight.  He's lost her.  Sees
     his hand's bleeding and lets Billy go, who nearly drops to the 
     floor.

                                STAMP
                Where's the loo then?

                                BILLY
                        (pointing up)
                - aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh...

     Stamp heads up the men's room.

                                BILLY
                        (croaking it out)
                ...

     Shakes his head, feeling lucky to escape with his life.

     EXT - PADDOCK - BETTING TABLE TWELVE

     Nyah into shot.  Stands in line.  She looks around.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                How'd you do?  Don't turn around.

     Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye.

                                NYAH
                I managed.

                                ETHAN
                You noticed.  What're you going to do?
                Spank me?

     She slips Ethan the envelope.  Ethan himself returns the look,
     holding it in spite of:

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Stamp's out of the loo.

     Luther arrives, with the camera, opening for Ethan.  Nyah turns
     away.  Ethan pulls out the tiny memory card, slips it in the 
     camera.

                                ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        (looking into camera)
                This is going to take a couple of
                minutes..

     is racing back to the van.

                Stamp's a little shaky, but headed your
                way, mate.

                        (nervous, she's heard Billy
                        too)
                What race are we talking about?

     INT - VAN (DAY)

     A sweaty Luther:

                                LUTHER 
                I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                He's heading down the stairs, now..

     Ethan places the digital camera on play and begins to go thru the
     stills.  As they cliff off, Ethan is visibly affected.

     LUTHER IN THE VAN

     watches the stills as well.  He's no less affected.

     ETHAN WITH NYAH

     He mutters some expletive under his breath, then, evenly:

                                ETHAN
                I want you out of Ambrose's place.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                He's one tier from the bottom.

     Ethan glances over to the bottom of the stairs.

                                NYAH
                What are you talking about?

     As he lowers camera and removes the memory card.

                                ETHAN
                I want you out of there.

                                NYAH
                Why?  What's happened. What did you see?

                                BILLY
                Thirty steps..

     Slipping card back into envelope.

                                ETHAN
                Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even
                the best of snake charmers get bit.

                                NYAH
                Ethan, tell me -
                                
                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Twenty, nineteen..

     Ethan's been talking to someone he's been urging to walk, not run
     to the nearest exit.  Now he drops all pretence:

                                ETHAN
                I want you out of Australia!
                        (more quickly)
                ..I don't know how much more plainly I can
                put it.

                                NYAH
                How do you suggest I go about it?

                                ETHAN
                He's touched your heart.  You're
                overwhelmed.  You need to think it over.
                You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If
                You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in
                and getting you out.  Give me the ear
                piece.

     She just gets it out of her hear and gives it to Ethan when she
     reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet.  She gives
     him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off -
     no more bets.  Flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops 
     the envelope.  She quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it,
     tucking it away and looking up - to see Stamp standing over her.
     almost exactly where Ethan had stood when she looked away.

     NYAH

     tries not to register alarm while she gauges how much Stamp had
     seen.

                                STAMP
                Get your bet down?

                                NYAH
                Just..

     She rises.  Stamp waits only a moment then follows.

     AT THE PRIVATE BLEACHERS (DAY)

     everyone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch.

     Ambrose is watching the race through binoculars.  Nyah comes up 
     behind and puts her arms around him.  With her left hand she puts
     the envelope into his right jacket pocket.

                                AMBROSE
                Your nag is making a run for it on the
                outside!
                        (lowering binoculars)
                Bloody hell, Nyah!

     She's momentarily startled.  Then:

                                AMBROSE (CONT'D)
                You picked another winner!

                                NYAH
                Well, that's good, isn't?

     A BLOW UP (INT. SHEEP FARM IMF SAFEHOUSE - DAY)

     of a shot from a digital camera card.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                Dr. Segi Gradski, Nekhorvich's
                colleague and lifelong friend..

     The photos is coded with the data in the lower left hand corner,
     01.27.99, the time in the right, 10:02:56 A.M.  Burned into the
     photo is '20 hours, 03 minutes after exposure.'

     Ethan paunches in.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
                Twenty hours and three minutes after
                exposure.
                        (sotto voce)
                Twenty hours.

     Ethan doesn't say anything for a moment, then goes on to the next
     photo on the card: '25 hours, 40 minutes after exposure.'  It's
     Gradski again.  Gradski's eyes are darkly circled, his skull look 
     mottled.

                                ETHAN
                Six hours later.

     Another photo: '31 hours, 30 minutes after exposure.' Gradski's
     bleeding from nose, mouth and ears, the skin eruptions are
     pervasive, his body an open wound.

                                ETHAN ( cont'd)
                Six more hours.

     The next photo.  '34 hours, 25 minutes after exposure.'  Gradski's
     body at rest.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Three hours after that, Gradski was dead..

                                LUTHER
                Here's a victim from the Bruny Island
                outbreak.

     The victim's face shows a devastation undeniably like Gradski's.

     A long, long moment as Ethan, Luther, and Billy sit in silence.

                                BILLY
                Oh, happy day.

     Ethan looks again at the first photo of Gradski.

                                ETHAN
                Nekhorvich said 'However we travel, I
                must arrive at my destination within 20 hours
                hours of departure.'

     CLOSE - NYAH (EXT. AMBROSE VERANDA - LATE AFTERNOON)

     Nyah is on the balcony.  Ambrose enters with two glasses of 
     champagne.  

                                AMBROSE
                To Australia.  It's made so many convicts
                feel at home.  Here's hoping it does the
                same for you..

     He laughs.  She doesn't.

                                NYAH
                Sean, there's something I've been meaning
                to talk to you about... Isn't going to be
                easy for me to say.

                                AMBROSE
                        (jocular)
                Then don't say it.

                                NYAH
                I don't know what to do about you, Sean.
                I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.

                                AMBROSE
                To do what?

                                NYAH
                Sort it all out.

                                AMBROSE
                And you're going to have time.  There's
                been a change of plans.

                                NYAH
                A change of plans?

                                AMBROSE
                Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner
                tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you
                don't mind.

                                NYAH
                Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.

                                AMBROSE
                Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after
                you.

                                NYAH
                Lovely.

     INT - AMBROSE STUDY (LATE AFTERNOON)

     Ambrose enters, slips off his jacket and hangs it over a chair.
     He walks to a desk and brings up a computer the Biocyte website
     and McCloy infomercial.  Stamp notes that Ambrose is 
     on the computer and moves to the desk.

                                STAMP
                I thought you were going to dinner.

                                AMBROSE

                        computer)
                Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory
                card.

                                STAMP
                Where is it?

                                AMBROSE
                In the envelope in my pocket.  My
                right.. jacket..pocket..

     Stamp leans over and pulls out the envelope.  As he does he sees 
     Ambrose has pulled up and started to play McCloy's informercial.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                        (calmly)
                We've got an opportunity here.  I'm not
                going to miss it..

                Ambrose obviously got these from
                Nekhorvich on the plane.

                                LUTHER
                What manic invents  disease like that in
                the first place?  Why would he do it?

                                ETHAN
                I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a
                manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.

                I told her to get outta there.

     EXT - LIMO (EVE)

     McCloy gets in the rear of the limo and lights up a cigar.  The
     limo takes off.  another car pulls out and tags along behind the
     limo.

     INT - OTHER CAR (MOVING)

     Michael at the wheel.

     INT - LIMO - MOVING (EVE)

     McCloy doesn't like the taste of the cigar, goes to toss it out
     but the electronic window button doesn't work.  He notices the
     evening paper partially open on the seat.  His name leaps out. He
     opens the paper

     THE HEADLINES

     announce that John C. McCloy, CEO of Biocyte, Inc., one of the
     world's leading pharmaceutical companies, has died of a straight
     and terrible strain of influenza

     Shocked, McCloy drops the paper, calling out:

                                MCCLOY
                George.  George.  George.

     The drover doesn't turn around.  McCloy can't believe it.  He
     bangs on chauffeur window.  The driver turns on the air
     conditioning in the rear of the limo.  McCloy clutches his throat
     and passes out.

     MCCLOY (INT. ICU UNIT - NIGHT)

     regains consciousness.  He's got tubes coming out of every
     orifice and is contained in the equivalent of a plastic bubble.
     Drenched in perspiration and he looks around for a call button.
     He grips the side of the bed.

                                MCCLOY
                Bloody room..just..shut your eyes, shut
                your eyes.

     He can't resist.  Opens them to look up thru the plastic to see:

     NEKHORVICH

     a shimmering blur coming in and out of focus.

                                MCCLOY (cont'd)
                I'll be buggered!..What's this then?


                                NEKHORVICH
                A visit from an old friend.

                                MCCLOY
                What's happening here?  You're dead!

                                NEKHORVICH
                Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little
                extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear
                Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure
                he has less than ten hours to live.

                                MCCLOY
                        (confused)
                It was in the bloody papers, on the
                telly..what's this about Gradski?

                                NEKHORVICH
                You are infected with Chimera, my friend.

     INT - AMBROSE BEDROOM (NIGHT) NYAH

     is on the phone.

                International, please.  I'd like to make a
                reservation on the next available flight tonight.

                                OPERATOR
                Where to?

                Where is next available flight going?

     The operator answers.

                                NYAH
                Fine.  I'll take it.

     She hangs up, goes to the door.  The house is eerily silent.

     POV - STAIRWELL (NIGHT)

     a play of shadows, the sound of the kitchen fridge.

     CLOSE - NYAH

     Moves softly downstairs & hesitates at bottom, glancing about.

                                NYAH
                Ulrich?..Ulrich!...

     Silence.  she goes into the kitchen.  No one.  She goes out the door.

     OVER NYAH'S SHOULDER - MOVING (EXT. SYDNEY - NIGHT)

     running pell-mell down to the shore.  Stops.  Looks outside the
     small skiff moored at the end of the dock.  It's dark and she
     decides to chance it.  She moves onto the pier, trying to glide
     by the boathouse.  A figure darts out and grabs her.  She tries to
     scream but can't.  The figure whips her around and she sees:

                                ETHAN
                Easy, easy, easy, shhh!

                                NYAH
                Oh Ethan!..

     She throws her arms around him.

                                ETHAN
                Are you okay?

                                NYAH
                I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get
                me out of here.

                                ETHAN
                It's going to be okay.

     He holds her.

     INT - HOSPITAL ROOM

     McCloy's strapped down, but manages to reach the call button and
     push it.  Again and again.

                                NEKHORVICH
                No use, my friend.  The medical staff
                wants no part of this.  Doctors don't
                fancy the idea of dying any more than
                anybody else.

     McCloy stares at Nekhorvich for a long moment.

                                MCCLOY
                How could I possibly be infected?

     Nekhorvich shrugs.

                                NEKHORVICH
                That's exactly what Gradski said - 27
                hours before he died.  With Chimera, the
                most minute exposure can be fatal.

     McCloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor.  He grips
     the edge of the hospital bed.

                                NEKHORVICH
                But then you shouldn't be feeling to ill.
                not for another three of four hours 
                anyway.

     McCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety.

                                MCCLOY
                You have Bellerophon.

                                NEKHORVICH
                        (mildly)
                Do I?

                                MCCLOY
                You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need
                it?

                                NEKHORVICH
                        (amused)
                'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred
                people on Bruny Island that you
                deliberately infected with Chimera needed
                it as well.

                                MCCLOY
                Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to
                be treated with Bellerophon within twenty
                hours?

                                NEKHORVICH
                By asking me.

                                MCCLOY
                You still don't get it, do you?  You want
                to make an omelet, you break a few eggs -
                I needed to know just how bad the disease
                was - in the real world, not the lab.  And
                you never know til you try.  You thought
                you were genetically splicing together
                strains of influenza to create a 
                cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you
                creating a disease so terrible in Chimera
                that the cure would be priceless.

                                NEKHORVICH
                You wanted the disease in order to peddle
                the cure.

                                MCCLOY
                Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed
                Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For
                hero to be appreciated, you need a monster.
                Now that's not so difficult to understand, is
                it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could
                knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not
                anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it
                takes to float one little pissy boutique
                antibiotic that's barely effective against one
                strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes 
                money killing the microscopic little shits that
                are out there, you'd help me put one out there
                I can make on!..there it is.  I've
                confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business
                to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding
                Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even
                know where to put the money they're making on
                Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do
                a thing for me even at twice the recommended

                a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated

                You know, I think it's a little late for
                that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if

     INT - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE MCCLOY'S ROOM)

     Nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask, and the vocal
     oscillator, revealing an exhausted Ethan.  Angle widens to
     include Luther and Billy in hospital greens.

     Luther and Billy nod in disgusted assent.

     EXT - ANNEX (NIGHT) NYAH

     holds tight in her embrace with Ethan.

                                NYAH
                Ethan, you know what frightens me most
                when I'm with him?..the thought of never 
                seeing you..how are we getting out of here?

                                ETHAN
                Nyah, it's very important not do
                anything to alarm Ambrose..

                                NYAH
                What?  You told me to get out of here.  I
                thought you were here to collect me.  I
                was so relieved.

                                ETHAN
                        (with growing urgency)
                No time to explain.  You've done well,
                and we're so close.  So close.  It's
                critical that you do whatever Ambrose
                asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon..
                That's a promise.. Come on, now off you
                go!

     He gives her an affectionate smile and she reluctantly heads back
     to the house, her expression troubled, even suspicious.

     INT - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE MCCLOY'S ROOM)

     Having just taken off the mask, Ethan stands with Luther and Billy.

                                LUTHER
                        (disgusted by what he's heard)
                So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's
                got Chimera.

                                BILLY
                There guys are walking around with
                different halves of the same dollar bill?

                                ETHAN
                Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich
                on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera
                virus.

                                LUTHER
                Yeah.  Why else would he come back to
                Australia?  If he had them both, he could
                sell them anywhere.

                                ETHAN
                I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting
                on a cure without a disease.

     EXT - AMBROSE HOUSE (NIGHT)

     Ethan enters and tears off his mask, revealing Ambrose filled
     with implacable rage.  He looks up to see Stamp who's been
     obviously waiting for him.  Tearing the voice oscillator.
     Leaning with both hands on a counter-surveillance monitor table
     he stares at the floor, his face rictus of hateful intensity.

                                STAMP
                You were right.  Hunt stung McCloy
                tonight.  He knows.  They'll be going into
                Biocyte...

     Ambrose looks up slowly to Stamp who's been standing by.

                                AMBROSE
                Good..then we go where he'll be, don't 
                we?  Well done, Hugh.  Well done.

                - where's George.  My regular driver.
                Where is he?

                say it's going around.  Nasty business.
                Mind you don't catch a chill now.

     Still dazed, McCloy manages to nod and exit the limo.  Billy
     drives off.

                Luther, do you have the building up and
                running?

     Luther punches in and up comes a squat little island a hundred
     yards off shore, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                That's not exactly it.

                                LUTHER
                Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their
                storage structure..

                                ETHAN
                Nyah still on the property?

                                BILLY
                She hasn't left it.

     Then:

                                LUTHER
                Okay, here you go -

     As Luther speaks, the building - on his computer graphics, one
     with the BIOCYTE PHARMACEUTICALS ELEVATORS AND RENDERINGS, is
     being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the
     rendering specifications by Luther, as if the building itself
     were being constructed at a madly rapid pace, from its foundation
     to its reinforced steel structure, to its honeycombing of floors,
     to its outer skin.  Luther's reconstitution of the building lot
     static, but moving around and above it even as he proceeds.

                                ETHAN
                Let's start from the inside out.

                                LUTHER
                All storage and production of Chimera is
                done here, in this lab on the forty-second
                floor, the heart of the building.

     BIOCYTE LAB

     Only about eight personnel -- chemists in lab coats, workers in
     bio-containment suits, etc. -- populate the lab, passing through
     security door and air locks, monitoring the virus stock, pading
     the injection gun, etc.

                                LUTHER'S VOICE
                Chimera itself is kept in two places: in
                production vials in an incubation room and
                housed in a small airtight chamber - inside
                three injection guns.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Mate, you kill it in both places, we're
                laughin' and we go home.

     WITH LUTHER AND ETHAN

                                ETHAN
                Now how to get in there.

                                LUTHER
                No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by 
                five guards on rotating patrol.

                If you look at Hunt's operational history, he
                invariably favors misdirection and deception.
                For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the
                ground where he has to risk confrontation
                with security.

                                ETHAN                        
                Not going in from the ground.  Show me the
                atrium.

     INT - BIOCYTE ATRIUM SHAFT

     The height and extent of the atrium are revealed, as well as its
     conclusion in a glass floor in the ceiling of the lab.

                                LUTHER'S VOICE
                        (unhappily)
                The atrium?  One of a kind.  Runs down the
                center of the building.  Provides 24-hour
                natural light via mirrors and daylight
                storage cells.  Optimal growing conditions
                for the virus.  Ends in a glass floor which
                doubles as part of the lab's ceiling.

     WITH LUTHER AND ETHAN

     Luther sees the glint growing in Ethan's eye.

                                LUTHER
                        Hey, atrium roof closes at sundown.

                And if the louvers are open for more than
                thirty seconds at night, the Civil
                Emergency alarms are tipped.  Those even I
                can't stop.  Thirty seconds total to get
                you in and the cable out.

                sort of acrobatic insanity to enter
                Biocyte somewhere through the atrium where
                security is minimal..

     for him to dart thru like thread thru a needle

     Luther begins the countdown.  His countdown continues, running

                Ethan does it the hard way to avoid 
                confrontation.  Neutralizing security 
                guards is simply too distasteful to him..

     INT - INCUBATION ZONE

     In front of each of three large television monitors is a vial
     shaped roughly like a sealed beaker somewhere between one and two
     liters in size.  Each one is contained behind Plexiglas and each 
     one pale yellow, one sunset red.  Behind them are monitors marked,
     respectively:  WORKING SEED STOCK, MASTER SEED STOCK, IN VITRO
     VIRUS.  Behind these is a monitor screen with a blow-up of the
     contents of the vials & the magnitude of the blow-up - 950,000x.

     These are X-Ray microscope blow-ups, i.e., allowing the viewer to
     see the motility of the virus and its metabolism, not dissimilar
     to an MRI this of Chimera in its three different cultures..

     Ethan's on the computer controls, racing thru to WORKING SEED
     STOCK, which calls for optimal levels of 6.9 pH and 11 
     degrees Celsius.  He drops the pH to zero and punches up the
     temperature to a hundred.  The effect on the greenish hue in
     the bottle is subtle but immediate - not so subtle is the
     effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically - they
     immediately appear agitated, their microscopic DNA innards
     contracting and expanding.

     Ethan moves on to the Master Seed Stock and the In Vitro Virus
     panels on the computer.  The changes he makes are reflected on
     the digital monitoring panels before each viral container.

     THE WORKING SEED

     vial has begun to change colors from sea green to a paler pea-
     green.  The liquid itself begins to thicken:

     As the liquid grows more viscous the X-Ray have a progressively
     more difficult time penetrating the individual cells, resulting
     in a low humming sound which grows as the liquid gels.

     The X-Ray microscope shows the individual seed-cells sticking
     together, some exploding, then all movement ceasing.  The Liquid

     congeals to an opaque mush.

     Ethan places a little plastique on a timer and runs up a ramp to

                He's still got three injection guns in the
                test lab..They're loaded with doses of
                Chimera which he'll destroy by firing
                into a hyper-thermal chamber.

     He places the barrel of the gun, seals the chamber, and fires.
     There's a tiny flash of light.  Ethan withdraws the gun.

     In a spasm of anxiety Luther bolts to his feet, wipes his brow.

     Luther glances thru the van window only to see reflected in the
     van side mirror:

     Ethan fires the second injection gun.  Picks up the third and
     last.  He pauses as he's about to fire it, staring intently
     suddenly the gun is held by:

     who turns the barrel from the hyper-thermal chamber and releases        
     into his wrist.

     BACK TO ETHAN - GLASS OBSERVATION ROOM

     whose vision of of Nekhorvich fades.  Still thinking of Nekhorvich he
     continues to stare at the gun for another moment and before he can fire:

     looks up just in time to see Ambrose and team arrive at the far 
     end of the lab.  They immediately open fire, shattering the
     room's walls and the glass injection gun chamber.  As the
     injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below, one of
     Ambrose's team runs to grab it, but before he can reach it he is
     shot by Ethan, who's falling to the floor below.

                                AMBROSE
                        (to Ulrich)
                Get it.

     As Ethan hits and dives for cover, Ulrich goes for the gun
     Ethan shoots Ulrich in the leg.  Ulrich hops back in pain.

                                AMBROSE
                Those were two explosions, your van and
                your safehouse, in case you didn't hear
                them both -- I believe that means you've
                also lost a friend.

     Ethan's crouching on the ground protected behind a series of
     vertical metal sheets.

                                ETHAN
                And you couldn't walk to tell me about it.

     Ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the
     shattered glass on the floor.  Ambrose, Wallis, and a couple of
     other Ambrose team members fire, kicking up broken glass.  Ethan
     backs off.

                                ETHAN
                Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell
                you.

                                AMBROSE
                You know, that was the hardest part of
                having to portray you.  Grinning like an
                idiot every fifteen minutes.

                                ETHAN
                I would've thought the hardest part was
                exercising restraint.  Curbing that
                pressing need of your to get your gun 
                off.  You were in such a hurry to knock
                off that 747, you never figured out where
                the virus really was.

                                AMBROSE
                I knew where it was.

                                ETHAN
                Oh.  then you knew the only way 
                could smuggle the live virus to the CDC
                scientists in Atlanta was by injecting
                himself and using his own bloodstream as a 
                Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty
                hours so he could take the anti-virus and
                still have it be effective.  You knew that
                while you were knocking him off and
                destroying the very thing you came for.

     Ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen
     round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a
     spray of gunfire, attempting to cover his own effort to the reach
     the injection gun.  The return fire nearly hits the injection
     gun, kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the
     floor.

                                AMBROSE
                Stop!  Put a sock in it!  Hit that bloody
                gun and you'll spray the bloody virus all
                over the place!

     Everybody's regained cover but the injection gun remains out of
     everybody's reach.

                                ETHAN
                There it is, guys, the last of it.

                opportunity to have both the bug and the

     Nyah walks out into view on her own.  Ethan sees her reflection in

                responsible for her actions..

                                ETHAN
                In other words, you're calling her a
                flake.

     CLOSE - NYAH

     listening.

                                AMBROSE
                You know women, mate.  Like monkeys, they
                are.  Won't let go of one branch til
                they've got a grip on the next...get it,
                Nyah.  I'll cover you.

     Ambrose cocks his weapon.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                I'm waiting.

                                NYAH
                        (not much more than body
                length from Ethan)
                This isn't exactly working out the way you
                thought it would, Ethan.  Sorry.

     Finger on the injection trigger, she rises and turns the barrel
     on her arm, firing.  The sound of the air pressure pushing the
     virus into her is unmistakable, as is the circle of tiny puncture
     wounds on her skin.  Nyah moves in front of Ethan, covering him,
     as she turns to face Ambrose.

     ETHAN

     shocked by Nyah's gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he
     resets the 'Countdown' on his chronometer to twenty hours.  As
     it drops into the nineteen:

                                AMBROSE
                        (frustrated in the extreme)
                You..bitch!

     She's been laughing away with Ethan:

                                NYAH
                You're not going to shoot, Sean.  Not
                this bitch.  She's worth thirty-seven
                million pounds.

     CLOSE - ETHAN'S HANDS

     fingers press a red button on a tiny detonator.  There's a bright
     heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water --
     the plastique killing any airborne virus.

     Ethan uses the diversion to grab Nyah and run with her to the far
     side of the lab, behind a stock of horizontal cylinders.

     INT - LAB

     Ambrose and team recover from the explosion and begin firing on
     the tanks protecting Ethan and Nyah, surrounding the two with
     fire and jets of released steam.

     INT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH

     behind the stack of tanks.  Ethan launches an explosive down a
     short hallway, blowing a hole in the building's exterior wall.

     INT - ENTRANCES TO THE LAB

     A group of Biocyte security guards enter from behind Ambrose and
     team and catch them off-guard.  All hell breaks loose.

     INT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH

                                ETHAN
                        (outraged)
                What did you think you were doing!

                                NYAH
                I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep
                you from getting hurt, that's all.

     This hits Ethan with the force of a blow.

                                ETHAN
                - you who don't have a conscience.

                                NYAH
                        (something of surprise to
                        her)
                I guess I lied..You can't get both of us 
                out of here, can you?

                                ETHAN
                No.

                                NYAH
                Then you'll have to kill me before it's
                too late.  Before I start killing people.

                                ETHAN
                No.

                                NYAH
                I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you
                don't have a choice.  Just do it now.

     She puts Ethan's gun to her forehead.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                For god's sake, get it over with.

     THE HAMMER

     pulls back.

     CLOSE - ETHAN

     He can't fire, lower the hammer.

                                ETHAN
                We've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before
                you start killing anybody.  I'll get 
                Bellerophon into your system by then.
                Just stay alive.  I'm not gonna lose you.

     Ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall
     once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambrose's
     team, wounding a couple men.  He reaches the wall and dives thru,
     camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in
     the air all around him.

     Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute
     deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it.

     PANNING SHOT - PAINTINGS (INT. CULTURAL ARTIFACT CENTER)

     of Aborigine paintings, eerie patterns made of man and nature
     phantasmagorical, like the patterns that form under the eyelids
     shortly before sleep.  B.G. the haunting notes of didgeridoo
     insure they're not being overheard.

                                SWANBECK

                'Bushfire Dreaming,'  'Wind Dreaming,' --
                oddly appropriate -

     Swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle
     weary Ethan:

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                - since it appears that Chimera, the
                mother of all nightmares is on the loose
                somewhere around here - is there any way
                this disaster can be viewed as a qualified
                one?

                                ETHAN
                        (tight-lipped)
                Not yet.  We did manage to pull any
                sensitive equipment and material out of
                our safehouse wreckage.

                                SWANBECK
                We could lock down passport control and
                all ports of authority, but that won't
                stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't
                know who else we're looking for -- all 
                terrorist bank accounts of which we're
                aware are stable.  No deposits, no
                withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.

                                ETHAN
                We think we've got our finger on the 
                buyer.

                                SWANBECK
                Do you?  Even assuming you're able to
                prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've
                now got an additional problem.  You
                destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If
                Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now,
                he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so
                of Miss Hall's blood to market.

                                ETHAN
                Yes, I believe that's right.

                                SWANBECK
                But that leaves another seven or eight
                pints of Chimera.

                                ETHAN
                You mean that leaves Miss Hall.

                                SWANBECK
                Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my
                understanding is that 20 hours after
                exposure, the victim becomes infectious.
                Highly infectious.

     Ethan glances at his chronometer.  Swanbeck sees it.

                                SWANBECK (CONT'D)
                You noted the time of exposure?

     Ethan nods.

                                SWANBECK (CONT'D)
                - good.  Then if you manage to get hold of
                Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've
                got -
                        (glancing at the chronometer)
                - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three
                seconds to destroy the largest remaining
                source of Chimera on earth.

                                ETHAN
                She sacrificed herself..

                                SWANBECK
                Brave girl.  If you can get hold of
                Bellerophon with the time limit, you may
                spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in
                either case you've got less than nine
                hours to kill her or cure her.  After that
                it's out of our hands and a matter of
                worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However
                you obtain it, we want you to preserve a
                sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.

     Ethan's staring at Swanbeck.

                                SWANBECK (CONT'D)
                Something else?

                                ETHAN
                Aren't you even curious?  About why she
                did it?

                                SWANBECK
                No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And
                neither can you, Hunt..

     As the eerie wail of the didgeridoo seems to mount in volume and
     intensity, the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems
     particularly oppressive.  Ethan's up against it and he knows it.

     A VIEW OF SYDNEY

     from harbors to skyline in all its sunlight splendor.

     Nyah sits for a moment, looking steadily at Ambrose.  Ambrose pats
     the cannister he's carrying.

                                AMBROSE
                Feel like pleading for your life?

                        (with an edge)
                Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

     Ambrose slaps her.  With scarcely a flicker of hesitation she
     slaps him back.

                                AMBROSE
                God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why
                did you save that bastard?

                                NYAH
                If it'll make you feel any better I won't
                do it again.

     It doesn't.  Full of pain and rage, he gets out of the car.

                                AMBROSE
                If it'll make you feel any better, you're
                going to take a lot of Aussies with you
                and make me a lot of money.

                                NYAH
                What are you talking about?

                                AMBROSE
                In just a few hours you can be assured of
                going down in history as the typhoid Mary
                of Oz.  G'day.

     A nameless guard from Michael's car idling nearby gets into the
     back seat with Nyah.  Ambrose shuts the car door in Nyah's face,
     gets in Michael's car takes off.

     Ambrose and team enter, where McCloy and his CHEMIST and
     ACCOUNTANT are waiting.  As Stamp stands back, observing, and
     Wallis sets up a laptop, Ambrose walks up to a refectory-like
     table and stands opposite McCloy.  Ambrose reaches into his coat
     and puts two cannisters on the table in front of McCloy.  McCloy's
     chemist picks up the cannisters and inserts them into two
     chambers connected to his microscope.

                                CHEMIST
                It's a DNA match.  The blood's loaded with
                Chimera.

     An insert of the microscope plate shows the two samples, as
     Bellerophen destroys Chimera.

     The chemist presses a button on the chamber and there's a heat
     flash.  The chamber red light moves to green, and there's a 
     mechanical voice: 'Substance destroyed.'

     INT - TUNNEL - OPEN AREA - ETHAN'S FEET

     stealthily approach a couple dozen jittery pigeons, cooing
     and pecking.  The intensity of their noise-making increases
     as Ethan reaches them.

     INT - TUNNEL - OUTSIDE OF THE SLABHOUSE ROOM DOORS

     Hearing the disruption of the pigeons, one of Ambrose's
     guards leaves his post at the double doors and head the 
     tunnel toward the birds to investigate.

     INT - TUNNEL - OPEN AREA

     Ambrose's guard draws his gun and continues approaching the
     pigeons.  Before the guard can see him, Ethan runs forward, and
     sends the pigeons into scattered flight, blinding the guard.
     Ethan jumps into a back flip and double kicks -- first knocking
     away the guard's gun and then knocking him out and flat on his
     back.  Ethan continues his flip and lands right back on his feet.

     INT - TUNNEL - OUTSIDE THE SLABHOUSE ROOM DOORS

     Ethan pulls a can of explosive material form his pack.  He
     rolls it towards the double doors, and it stops just before
     reaching them.  Then, pointing his gun to the ceiling, he 
     fires into the air.

     INT - SLABHOUSE ROOM - AMBROSE

     Stamp nods to two guards to check it out.  They head across
     the room to the double doors.

     waits for the right moment before raising his and firing
     at the can of explosives.  Just as it ignites, the guards
     open the doors and are blown back by force of the explosion.

     reacts and turns toward the explosion.  Amidst the flames and        
     debris, a single white dove comes flying into the room.  And
     beyond it, Ambrose can see Ethan Hunt in silhouette walking
     slowly past the doorway.

     the tunnel-corridor in the direction of the explosion.

     run down the tunnel.  The guards move commando-style, directed
     by Stamp's hand signals.

     pass a couple of doorways.  A pigeon flies past Stamp's face and
     he stops.  As he turn, Ethan Lowers himself from a hiding place
     in the ceiling.  Stamp and Ethan pull their guns on one another.
     They're in a face-off until they both agree to drop their guns,
     but Stamp catches his in mid-air and points it back at Ethan.

                                ETHAN

                You're too trusting.  Raise your hands
                slowly.

     As Ethan raises his hands, he pulls the pin on a grenade and then
     kicks it between Stamp's legs.  The handle flies off:  It's live.
     When Stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade, Ethan kicks out
     his gun.

     Trying to escape the grenade, Stamp smashes into Ethan and seems
     to have hit him in the jaw.  Both hit the ground as the grenade
     explodes, with Stamp appearing to have the upper hand.

     Ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only
     manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which
     continue as:
        

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)

                No?  Well, then.  This is what's known as
                getting your gun off.

     With that Ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two
     Berettas into Ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor.
     McCloy nearly faints, and Ambrose laughs at his squeamishness
     until something on Ethan's body catches his eye: the top of the
     little finger on the right hand is bleeding.  Ambrose grabs
     Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes
     wide open and thoroughly lifeless.  His jaw, under the mask had
     been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape Ethan has
     used to mount the drain-pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall.

     kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before.

     Ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair

     Billy and Luther in the copter are over the island, and bank so
     Luther can fire a grenade launcher and blow the back of Ambrose's
     boat.

     The guards close the gate, Ethan runs the motorcycle up the
     hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge.  Ambrose follows
     in the SUV, crashing thru the gate.

     They race across the bridge and the road, onto the huge
     greensward opposite to and similar in shape to Bare Island.
     There, with the helicopter hovering, Ambrose manages to corner
     Ethan and after they expend whatever ammunition their weapons
     hold, they move into each other bare handed and engage in
     ferocious, no-holds-barred combat, the helicopter hovering low
     enough to keep away whatever's left of Ambrose's henchmen, the
     chopper's downdraft hitting them and flattening the grass around
     them.  Ethan prevails.

     hits the Falcon's trunk, lifting its back wheel off the ground,
     but the Falcon keeps coming, its trunk ablaze.  Luther reloads as
     a gunman leans out the window, firing up at Ethan on the hill.

     BEAR ISLAND HILL - ETHAN

     lays on the cycle's throttle, accelerates down the hill and
     propels the bike into the air and off the island, just as

     again fires his grenade launcher, this time at the front of the
        
     BEAR ISLAND BRIDGE - GOLD FALCON

     on the bridge.  The grenade explodes at the front of the car
     and hurls the Falcon into the air and off the bridge.

     BEAR ISLAND - HILL/BRIDGE - ETHAN

     is in mid-air on the cycle, heading down toward the bridge.  Just
     as he lands, the Gold Falcon flies off the bridge, and Ethan
     speeds through the flames and off onto the mainland.

     BEAR ISLAND - BRIDGE

     Michael's SUV arrives and tears through the gate and flames,
     followed by Wallis' sedan and then Ambrose, riding a motorcycle.

     ROAD LEADING FROM BRIDGE - ETHAN

     races up the road to find a white Falcon approaching.

     The IMF chopper arrives and gunfire's exchanged.  Luther takes a
     hit in the shoulder and drops his gun as the chopper banks away.

     INT - HELICOPTER - LUTHER

     Luther grips his shoulder in pain and falls back into his seat,
     jarring the GPS computer.  It responds by beeping and coming to
     life.  Nyah's yellow dot pops up on the screen.

                Ethan, the computer's up.  I've got Nyah.
                She's moved out of the city.

     EXT - ROADWAY

     Ethan heads downhill as the SUV approaches on an adjacent road.
     He pulls out in front of it, immediately drawing fire.  Without
     slowing, Ethan drops to the side his cycle for cover.

     INT - IMF HELICOPTER - LUTHER

     watches the GPS laptop as the chopper speeds over Sydney.

     EXT - ROADWAY - ETHAN AND WALLIS' SEDAN

     Wallis' sedan appears from an adjoining road and pulls in behind
     Ethan, who climbs back aboard his cycle.  Cut off, the SUV turns
     onto a side road to intercept Ethan.

                                WALLIS
                Get him.

                                ULRICH
                I can't get a good shot.

     Before an intersection, Ethan both revs and brakes, spinning the
     bike and creating a smoke screen.  Wallis' car enters the smoke.

                                ULRICH (cont'd)
                I can't see him, mate.  Slow down!

                                WALLIS
                Shut up.  I know what I'm doing.

     Wallis breaks hard, but not hard enough:  he stops just in the
     path of an oncoming 18-wheeler.  His car's demolished.

     EXT - ROADWAY - ETHAN AND SUV

     Ethan pulls out of the smoke as the SUV bursts out of the scrub
     behind him, striking the rear of the cycle.  Ethan puts his bike 
     into a spin and pulls his gun, ending up alongside the SUV
     passenger window.  He fires through the window, shooting both
     Michael and the bodyguard.

     The SUV veers off, crashing into a line of parked cars.  It hits
     the first car and flips up and over, landing upside down on
     several more parked cars.  Ethan speeds off on his smoking cycle.
     Ambrose arrives and then takes a side road.

     Luther looks up from the screen to see the bluff of North Head at
     the entrance to Sydney's harbor.

     EXT - THREE-LINED ROADWAY - ETHAN

     tearing down the road, when suddenly from a side trail Ambrose
     pulls out behind him and begins firing.  Ethan weaves to avoid
     Ambrose's fire and passes a car, pulling in front of it for
     cover.  The car skids, forcing Ambrose to veer around it.

     FROM COPTER TO GROUND (MOVING)

     rapidly approaching the North Head bluff.

                                BILLY

     moving up behind Nyah who is walking purposefully to the edge of
     the bluff and a precipitous drop to rocks and surf a hundred and 
     fifty feet below.

     Camera drops to Nyah's shoulder level and moves with her to the
     bluff's edge.  As she's just a few steps away from stepping
     off, there's a roar and the helicopter rises into the shot,
     before her wild-eyed Billy gesturing, 'Stop!  Stop!' to Nyah.

     EXT - ROADWAY

     Ethan passes narrowly between a car and oncoming truck.  Ambrose
     follows as soon as the truck clears.  Ethan fires backward using 
     his side-view mirror to aim, exploding Ambrose's windscreen.
     Ambrose skids until his wheel clips a rock, knocking him upright.

     Ethan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub.  Back
     on the main road, Ambrose roars off to intercept Ethan.

     EXT - CLIFFTOP - ROCK LEDGE

     On a clifftop clearing, Ethan races along as Ambrose moves to cut
     him off.  They head toward one another.

                                LUTHER'S VOICE
                Ethan, we've got her.  Tracking to you now.
                We're reading 5 minutes 19 seconds.

     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING

     Ethan and Ambrose round a bend and face one another.  Without
     hesitating, they charge towards each other.  As they near one
     another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide
     hard in mid-air.  They fall to the ground fighting as their bikes
     skid and Ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them.

     Ethan and Ambrose rush towards one another.  Ethan flips Ambrose
     to the ground.  Ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster.  As
     Ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off
     a 30-foot cliff.

     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT

     Ethan and Ambrose rise from the fall.  Ethan jumps up and sweeps
     Ambrose, dropping him to the ground.  Ethan begins strangling
     Ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, Ambrose
     gets Ethan in a choke hold.

     Ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits Ethan in the
     midsection and the face.  Ethan kicks it out of his hand and
     connects with several punches, knocking Ambrose to the ground.

     Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts
     Ethan across the back and face.  Ambrose dives on Ethan and the
     knife is poised above Ethan's eye before Ethan grabs the knife
     and clears, holding it out toward Ambrose.

                                AMBROSE
                Go ahead.  Use it Hunt.  It's not a bad
                way to go.  A lot better than the way that
                bitch is going to die.

     Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of
     kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.  Ethan steps
     back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping
     kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his
     hand.

     EXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER - CLIFFTOP

     As they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally
     gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat.

     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT

     Ethan turns and walks away from Ambrose toward the cliff edge.
     The copter lands and Luther runs toward Ethan but pulls up,
     looking over Ethan's shoulder.  Ambrose has a gun aimed at        
     Ethan's back.

                                AMBROSE
                Hunt.  You should have killed me.

     Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by
     dust from the copter.  Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and
     then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air.  He
     catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.

     Ethan reaches Nyah at the copter.  Inches apart, they can only
     stare silently at one another.

     Didgeridoo music.  A child admires a painting.  Swanbeck and Ethan
     face one another.  A long, long pause.  For a moment it appears as
     if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence.

                                SWANBECK
                Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to
                begin.  Any suggestions?

                                ETHAN
                You'd like me to conduct my own
                debriefing.

                                SWANBECK
                Why not?  You've done just about
                everything else on this operation.

                                ETHAN
                I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was
                a compliment.

                                SWANBECK
                Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations
                requires the level of disinformation that
                yours do, is bound to get a little flak
                here and there.  You try flogging the
                stories on CNN I've had to come up with
                about what's been going on around here the
                last few days.  At any rate, it's been
                most instructive -- what they'll swallow,
                or what they'll broadcast with a straight
                face.
                        (picking up a file)
                Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has
                absolutely no elements of the Chimera
                virus.  Not even antibodies.

                                ETHAN
                Yes, I gathered as much.

                                SWANBECK
                And the only other remaining sample was in
                the canister you recover from Ambrose.

                                ETHAN
                Yes.

                                SWANBECK
                And that appears to have been destroyed.
                It also contained the anti-virus,
                Bellerophon.

                                ETHAN
                Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only
                really effective against Chimera.

                                SWANBECK
                But you were under specific instructions
                to bring back a living sample of the
                Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to
                know how, after you'd managed its recovery
                intact, it subsequently got destroyed.

                                ETHAN
                By fire.  That's the best way, really.


                                SWANBECK
                So you didn't fail mission, you simply
                changed it.

     Ethan doesn't respond.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                It's no longer enough for you to execute
                and implement IMF policy, you now wish to
                go in the business of creating it?

                                ETHAN
                No, I don't.  But in this case -

                                SWANBECK
                In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In
                face, it was a pretty damn good idea.
                Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for
                Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her
                criminal records will certainly be
                expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.

                                ETHAN
                I do.

                                SWANBECK
                Where is she now, by the way?  Do you
                know?

                                ETHAN
                I don't.  No exactly.

                                SWANBECK
                Well, Hunt, what are your plans?

                                ETHAN
                Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll
                let you know where I'm going.

                                SWANBECK
                Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't 
                be a vacation if you did.

     Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance.

     EXT - SYDNEY (DAY)

     Ethan emerges to a very crowded street.  Billy and Luther are
     waiting.  Both look to Ethan.

                                LUTHER
                        (worried)
                So what did he say?

                                ETHAN
                Good job.  And thanks.

                                BILLY
                        (incredulous)
                That's it?  That's it? That's it?

                                LUTHER
                        (dryly, looking at Billy)
                And the check's in the mall.

                                BILLY
                Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy
                Baird's the name.  Anything you need to
                get, move or watch, I'm your man.

     And Billy's gone.  Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant
     to say anything, both reluctant to leave.

     One quick bear hug, then:

                                LUTHER
                Always nice hearing from you man.  Stay in 
                touch..

     And Luther's off.  Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully.  Then,
     curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd.  After a half-
     dozen steps, something catches his eyes.  He stops.

     One quick bear hug, then:

                                NYAH
                        (a tad wary)
                Do you know me?

     NYAH

     is inches from him.  Without batting an eye.


                                ETHAN
                No.  Should I?

                                NYAH
                No.  You just looked as if you did.

                                ETHAN
                No...

     She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable
     conviction.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                ...just as if I'd like to.

                                NYAH
                Oh.  Well..

     He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for
     hers.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                ..I think that can be arranged.

     Looks around at the swirling crowd:

                                ETHAN
                Let's get lost.

     And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the
     crowd.  Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever
     filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash
     of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on
     its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:

     FADE IN:

     A WORN SATCHEL (MOVING - DAY)
    
     is being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black 
     armband.  VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH exits a gleaming building, pausing 
     for a moment, under a motto clearly visible above his head, 
     'Where the future is now'.  He checks the time.

     INSERT - WATCH

     set in Countdown Mode.  It's at 19 hours forty-seven minutes and 
     sixteen seconds and dropping, 19:37.15,  :14,  :13,  :12 etc.

     O.S. children are singing:

                Ring a ring a rosy/a pocketful of posy/
                a tissue a tissue/we all fall down.

     Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent 
     Natural History Museum.  They are moving in and around an odd
     freeform sculpture.

     POV - SCULPTURE AND CHILDREN

     a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, 
     almost like mirrors in a fun house.

     NEKHORVICH 

     wipes his eyes, a horn honks.  He looks toward the sound.

     MOVING SHOT - SATCHEL (INT. AIRPORT SECURITY - DAY)

     on the belt that takes it thru X-Ray.  On the other side a guard 
     opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal 
     items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small 
     plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, 
     hi-tech and at odds with the other items.  She pulls out an urn-
     shaped vessel.

                                GUARD
                What's this, then?

                                NEKHORVICH 
                        (handing her documents)
                The ashes of a colleague, I'm taking them
                to his family.  If you wish to open it,
                please be careful.

     COMPUTERIZED SCREEN DISPLAY (INT. PLANE - MOVING - DAY)

     on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight 
     point of departure in Sydney, continuously updating distance, 
     direction and time to its ultimate destination, Atlanta, Georgia.

                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                - folks, we're a little over two and a 
                half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but 
                if you look out your windows on either 
                side of the aircraft, we'll soon be 
                crossing the southern section of the Rocky 
                Mountains, a range which includes more 
                than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet.  
                The chain's loftiest point, Mount Elbert, 
                at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view 
                as we pass over central Colorado shortly..

     NEKHORVICH (INT. CABIN - DAY)

     seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance.  He  
     checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours 
     and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending 
     seconds whipping by.

     ETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat 
     beside Nekhorvich.

                                ETHAN
                You keep staring at that watch as if your
                life depended on it, Doctor..

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.

                                ETHAN
                They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be 
                with old friends.

                                NEKHORVICH 
                        (meaning Ethan)
                I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

                                ETHAN
                Sorry it couldn't be under happier 
                circumstances.

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm
                sorry..'
                        (bemused laughter, then looks at Ethan)
                - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.

     Nekhorvich is overcome.  Ethan puts a comforting hand on his  
     shoulder:

                                ETHAN
                He was quite a man.  Did he know before 
                the end you two had succeeded?

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Yes, he knew.  Just..

                                ETHAN
                ..not in time to save him.

                                NEKHORVICH 
                No.  After you've lived with Chimera for 
                twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not 
                even...Bellerophon.

     Nekhorvich pats the satchel.

                                ETHAN
                You carry them together?  Safely?

     With an almost impish grin and a wink:

                                NEKHORVICH 
                Yes, and you'll get us to a safe place 
                with them, thank god!..left to my own 
                devices, I'm an old fart too inept to read 
                a railroad timetable!..

     Good-natured laughter.  Cut off by a flight steward who passes 
     by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction. 
     Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling.  Passengers are 
     puzzled and alarmed.

                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                You Captain again.  We've experienced a 
                slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..
                
     A passenger struggling with his mask.  As Nekhorvich fumbles with 
     the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows 
     their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping.  He checks the 
     countdown time on his watch again.  Nekhorvich looks around him.  
     The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the 
     passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.

     INT - COCKPIT

     The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks.

                                CAPTAIN
                        (into radio)
                Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center.  This is 
                Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven, 747 
                heavy.  We are not reading you.  We're 
                unable to maintain cabin pressurization.  
                We have initiated a descent to one six
                thousand.

     The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands 
     slip off the controls.  His eyes flutter, then:

                                CO-PILOT
                Captain, I don't..can't..

     He passes out.  The Captain, HUGH STAMP, turns to verify that the
     relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls.

     He then removes his oxygen mask, sets the auto pilot, inputting 
     numbers to slow the plane and descend.  As the craft titles 
     downward...

     INT - GALLERY

     The flight attendants are pulling on jump suits.  Stamp emerges
     from the cockpit.

     INT - CABIN

     Ethan returns.  Nekhorvich beckons to him.  Ethan sits.  Grinning 
     around, Nekhorvich conspiratorially:

                                NEKHORVICH
                ..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.

                                ETHAN
                        (in the same tone)
                You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really 
                shouldn't.

     Nekhorvich's eyes narrow.

                                NEKHORVICH
                You're not Dmitri?

     With a lightning swift move Ethan breaks Nekhorvich's neck.

                                ETHAN
                - no.

     He grabs the satchel.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                        (to Wallis)
                Wallis, hold onto it.

     Wallis slashes the satchel handle open, takes the satchel for 
     Ambrose.  He peels off the latex mask, revealing SEAN AMBROSE.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Ulrich, pull the -

     He tears off the vocal oscillator at his adam's apple, clears his 
     throat, now as Ambrose:

                                AMBROSE
                - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..

                                STAMP
                        (the 'captain' into shot)
                All done, chief..

                                AMBROSE
                        (what else)
                - right -
                        (kidding)
                - don't go too far ahead of me now -

                                STAMP
                Not possible..

     Ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just 
     beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane.  Stamp pulls 
     back the panel, hops into the compartment below which is four 
     walls of electronic equipment.  Stamp kneels and slides back the 
     floor hatch.  The wind howls, puffs of cloud zip by beneath them.  
     As they descend into the belly:

                                WALLIS
                Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus 
                two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven-
                niner knots..

                                AMBROSE
                It's that time.  Go.

     They don goggles and, with Ambrose in the lead, 
     the team leaps, one after another from the hatch, sailing off
     into the sky.

     INT - COCKPIT (DAY)						

     An automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone:

                                VOICE
                Terrain, terrain.  Pull up, pull up.

     The co-pilot stirs.  He blearily rouses himself just in time to 
     see:

     A mountain rushing toward him.  As mountain meets airplane, the 
     frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the 
     fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, 
     which ignited, lights a fuse..

     The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:

     EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)

     For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the 
     plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle 
     widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from 
     than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the 
     midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at 
     least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of 
     a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan 
     climbs out of shot.

     WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)

     revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and 
     whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, 
     fluffy clouds overhead.

     Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds 
     he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears 
     relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's 
     holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost 
     expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on 
     the soundtrack.

     Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six 
     inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by 
     five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem 
     terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.

     It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close 
     just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.  
     Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, 
     as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when 
     its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his 
     climb.

     A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY)

     near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now 
     traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet 
     exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain 
     almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a 
     handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a 
     lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of 
     feet to oblivion.
                                
                                ETHAN
                Whoaa..

     He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.

     REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT

     with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the 
     summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who 
     favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To 
     lizard:

                                ETHAN
                You're welcome.

     The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back 
     attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the 
     beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo 
     streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now 
     ominously circling back.

     Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of 
     the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.

     The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has 
     opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.

     ETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES

     First, a retinal scan.

                                ELECTRONIC VOICE
                Identity confirmed.

                                SWANBECK
                Good morning, Mr. Hunt.

     Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen.  Over his introduction of Nyah 
     is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive 
     she never seems to give the camera a clean shot.

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE
                Your mission, should you choose to accept 
                it, requires you to recover a stolen item, 
                designated Chimera.  Essential to the 
                mission is the recruitment of a civilian -- 
                a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall.  She is a highly 
                capable professional thief currently 
                active in Spain.

     A series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i.e., warrants, complaints, 
     Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as 
     glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville.

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
                Her dossier's available on I-COM 3.  You 
                have 48 hours to recruit Ms. Nordoff-Hall 
                and meet me in Seville to receive further 
                details.  Should you or any member of your 
                IM force be caught or killed, the 
                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.

     Swanbeck's face reappears on screen:

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
                And Mr. Hunt - the next time you go on 
                vacation, please be good enough to let us 
                know where you're going.  This message will 
                self-destruct in five seconds.

     Ethan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space.

                                ETHAN
                If I let you know where I'm going -

     The glasses explode in a puff of smoke.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                - won't be on holiday.

     Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps 
     off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal 
     snit.  Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a 
     little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his 
     back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries 
     of flamenco dancers.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)

     Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving 
     guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, 
     exits her car and enters the villa.

     A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE)

     where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands 
     wielding the castanets.  The dancers perform on a raised platform 
     and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling 
     skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.

     REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN

     looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the 
     relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the 
     crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder 
     over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah 
     offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to 
     the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one 
     another.  Ethan approaches her.

                                ETHAN
                Do you know me?

                                NYAH
                No.  Should I?

                                ETHAN
                No.  You just looked as if you did.

                                NYAH
                No.  Just as if I'd like to.

                                ETHAN
                Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.

                                NYAH
                Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -

                                ETHAN
                There's not enough time in the world for 
                any of it to be bad.

     This stops her.  Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose 
     to nose.  Whispered but breezy:

                                NYAH
                Look, it's either you or the rent and I 
                don't mind telling you it's not an easy 
                choice.

                                ETHAN
                What if I pay the rent?

                                NYAH
                Uh-huh.

                                ETHAN
                Uh-huh?

     Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink 
     then:

                                NYAH
                Go find the wealthy lady you came with and 
                next time we meet - I'll pay your rent. 
                        (kissing him, sweetly)
                Now bugger off.

     And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated 
     desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of 
     the dancer's steps to cover her own.  Once upstairs, a security 
     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
     down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to 
     Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the 
     windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.  
     In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard 
     can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the 
     hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out 
     of shot.

     INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)

     Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.

     INT - BATH (EVE)

     A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored 
     walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         
     chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of 
     ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and 
     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to 
     its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, 
     revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds 
     it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from 
     green thru yellow and into red.

                                NYAH
                        (her fondest hopes confirmed)
                Mmmm.

     She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the 
     tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any 
     cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she 
     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing 
     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.  
     She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.

     There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble 
     casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of 
     relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself 
     looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked 
     compartments.  As she studies them:

                                ETHAN
                Decisions, decisions.

     Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom 
     mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.

                                NYAH
                What are you doing here?

                                ETHAN
                Think you're the only one who can pick a 
                lock?

                                NYAH
                        (not altogether pleased)
                I see.  You're not just another pretty face..

     Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the 
     bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Oh god.  A bloody baritone.

     Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.  
     She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the 
     tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they're nose to 
     nose.
                                
                                ETHAN
                I take it you prefer tenors.

     She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR 
     AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's 
     changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He 
     breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and 
     disappears from the dressing room mirror.

                                NYAH
                Would you mind if I'm on top?

                                ETHAN
                Oh, either way works for me.

     With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins 
     working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque 
     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara 
     brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues 
     working with the pick and wrench.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                You're never gonna find it there.

                                NYAH
                        (she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)
                Damn it!  Find what?

                                ETHAN
                His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes 
                up for auction Tuesday.

     Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:

     LOOKING UP

     more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against 
     the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's 
     lower pelvic region as she straddles him.  Not exactly in the mood 
     to move:

     She stiffens - he knows too damn much.

                                NYAH
                - right..where is it?

                                ETHAN
                Far right. 

     She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
     bottom right compartment.  She's utterly nonplussed:

                                NYAH
                Where's the bloody -

                                ETHAN
                        (plucking it off his chest,
                        offering it up like a mechanic
                        under the chassis)
                - torque wrench.

                                NYAH
                - this is very disconerting..

                                ETHAN
                Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm
                told.

                                NYAH
                - right..

     She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque
     wrench and carbide pick - and it's open.  She withdraws a velvet
     pouch and opens the pouch.  Out spills the spectacular necklace.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Lovely.
                        (starting to close the safe)
                Who are you and what's it going to cost me?

                                ETHAN
                        (having sat up)
                I wouldn't do that.

                                NYAH
                Do what?

     The alarm goes off.

                                ETHAN
                That.

     The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn
     Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in.

                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
                Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you!
                        (in Spanish to security guards,
                        annoyed)
                It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer.

                                ETHAN
                Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is
                that the heat sensors were activated.   But
                Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate -

     Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.

                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
                Mucho gusto, senorita.

                                ETHAN
                - did feel that she had rather too long to
                work on the safe before they triggered the
                alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall?

                                NYAH
                Oh yes.  Absolutely.  Much too long I
                should yes.

     Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary,
     intensified curiosity - about Ethan.

                                ETHAN
                Under the circumstances I think we would
                recommend re-setting the senors to
                respond to a lighter load.  How do you
                feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?

                                NYAH
                Indeed.

                                ETHAN
                Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason 
                to disrupt your party any longer.  we have
                some further concerns about the disposition
                of your security guards, which you'll
                receive in our written report by fax in the
                morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?

     He offers Nyah his arm.  They start out.  Ethan immediately stops.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten
                something?

     Nyah looking genuinely puzzled.

                                NYAH
                The necklace?

     Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering
     string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.

                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
                        (a great kidder)
                What are you trying to do, senorita?  Rob
                me.

     They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door.

     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)

     The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.  Ethan and Nyah
     emerge from the villa, walking slowly.  Nyah's clearly
     preoccupied.

                                NYAH
                I'm missing something here, aside from a
                500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I
                botched the job, I could've walked out of 
                there with the bloody thing.

                                ETHAN
                At least you walked.

                                NYAH
                If you weren't going to let me get away
                with it, why did you let me go thru with
                it?

                                ETHAN
                Wanted to see how good you were.
                I'm hoping we might work together.

                                NYAH
                May I say something, no offence?  You
                look like a gigolo, you sound like a 
                thief, you act like a cop - what the
                bloody hell do you have in mind?

                                ETHAN
                Working under adverse conditions.  Highly
                adverse conditions.

                                NYAH
                Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi
                carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You
                couldn't possibly want me off tonight's
                performance..

                                ETHAN
                You didn't do that badly.

     Her car arrives.

                                NYAH
                        (as she moves to her car)
                You're apologizing for me?  Quite the
                gentleman..

                                ETHAN
                        (opening the car door)
                Not really.  I triggered the alarm..

     One foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to Ethan.

                                ETHAN
                Hey, the Bulgari job last week was
                flawless.  And I've always been partial to
                pale yellows.

     She slides behind the wheel.

                                NYAH
                        (as he leads on the car)
                I don't do laundry, or put up with
                cheeky bastards who set me up on their
                territory so they can poach on mine.

     She takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake.
     Ethan smiles and shakes his head.

     ON THE ROAD - NYAH (MOVING)

     around curves, hair flying, she's free.  Her car phone rings.
     Perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up:

                                NYAH
                        (tentatively)
                Hola..

                                ETHAN
                Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?

                                NYAH
                Where did you get this number?  I don't
                even have it!

                                ETHAN' VOICE
                Would you like it?

     She hits the End button and disconnects.  The phone immediately
     rings again.  She refuses to pick up.  Ethan pulls alongside hers.
     She looks at him.  They speak through the open cars.

                                ETHAN
                Pull over and listen to me, will you?
                Just listen..

                                NYAH
                Listen to what?

                                ETHAN
                I need your help and I thin you can use
                mine.

                                NYAH
                Your help?  What are you talking about?

                                ETHAN
                Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch
                authority.  I can make them go away.

                                NYAH
                Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.

     She floors it and shoots ahead of Ethan, nicking his car as she takes off.

                                ETHAN
                        (to himself)
                I deserved that.

     SERIES OF DRIVING SHOTS - NYAH AND ETHAN

     Ethan rings her again.  And keeps ringing.  Her face becomes
     grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethan's
     pursuit progressively more determined.  They are reaching the
     limits of adhesion around blind curves.

     MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)

     The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin
     turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of
     marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.

     Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in
     this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank
     and sees on his GPS what Nyah can't see thru the fog - 
     less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly
     negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of
     feet to rock and sea below.  Ringing her number again:

                                ETHAN
                        (half to himself)
                Slow down, slow down.

     She turns up a mound and loses control.  She spins out and heads
     toward the edge of the cliff.

                                NYAH
                        (realizing she's in trouble)
                Uh-oh.

     Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin.
     Her car stops just at the cliff's edge.

     Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.

                                ETHAN
                No!

     Suddenly there's no Nyah.  Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and
     sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet
     below, holding the door handle.

                                NYAH
                Oh..oh..

     Taking a firm grip on her wrist.

                                ETHAN
                Don't look down.  Just..look at me.
                That's it..that's it..

     He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into
     his arms.  For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.  Then:
        
                                NYAH
                What's you name?

                                ETHAN
                Ethan Hunt.

                                NYAH
                Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to
                talk to me about?

     Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.  Her dark eyes
     suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.

                                ETHAN
                ...more than I thought..
                
     They scarcely to move to bring their lips together:

                                NYAH
                Awfully short notice..

                                ETHAN
                Care to wait a decent interval?

                                NYAH
                Who wants to be decent?..

     DISSOLVE:

     CLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE)

     sleeping.  His eyes open slowly.  He comes to full consciousness,
     his head still on the pillow.  Something approaching serious
     anxiety informs his features.  He lifts his head and looks at his
     left, angle widening.  Nyah lies on her side facing him,        
     sleeping serenely.  Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't-
     approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed.  He lets his head flop
     back on the pillow.  Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to-
     profile.  As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced
     by curiosity and even wonder.  He lifts his hand and just
     brushes her cheek.  Her eyes open.  She knows where she is.

                                ETHAN
                So what've you got against spooks?

     Nyah smiles.

                                NYAH
                When they've got your recruiting
                technique?  Not a thing.

                                ETHAN
                Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.

                                NYAH
                They've got a book for this?

                                ETHAN
                They've got a book for everything.

                                NYAH
                The only other spook I knew was a liar.
                Charming but absolutely incapable of
                telling the truth.  He'd lie about his
                favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an
                occupational hazard.  All spies really do
                is conceal the truth and tell lies.

                                ETHAN
                Not revealing information doesn't
                necessarily make someone a liar.

                                NYAH
                That's not the point.  In the end what
                spies rely on is the one thing they think
                they know that you don't.

                                ETHAN
                Which is?

                                NYAH
                That they're lying.

     Ethan laughs.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                ..once they know that they can
                get very very..crosee..

     Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan.

                                ETHAN
                So where did I got right?

                                NYAH
                You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully
                good one..
                        (then)
                ..this thing these blokes pinched..

                                ETHAN
                I don't know that they 'pinched' it.
                Don't even know that they're blokes.

     Nyah stops to think about this.

                                NYAH
                Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume
                I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to
                catch-a-thief..

                                ETHAN
                So do I.  Sort of.

     Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.

                                NYAH
                Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?

                                ETHAN
                Of what?

     Nyah laughs.

                                NYAH
                Ask a question, you get an answer!..

                                ETHAN
                Damn, you're beautiful.

                                NYAH
                That's because I'm on my back.

     Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down
     at him.

                                ETHAN
                I don't think so.

     She sinks into his arms.

     EXT-INT - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)

     Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his
     way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema
     portion of the Fallas de Valencia.  On this night great papier
     mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the
     city and torched in great bonfires.  Outside the bar Ethan's
     looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and
     flowers.  He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going 
     to buy some flowers.

     He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be
     seen on the petals.  Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar,
     and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.
     Turns back to the vendor.

                                ETHAN
                Are you gonna be here a while?

                                VENDOR
                Si, senor.

                                ETHAN
                I'll pick'em up on my way out, okay?

     Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where
     he passes security at a pair of double doors.

     INT - IMF BRIEFING ROOM

     Swanbeck stands looking out the window.  Noisy crowds from the
     festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the
     first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid
     background thru briefing room's window.

                                SWANBECK
                Fetival's a pain in the ass.  Honoring
                saint by setting'em on fire.
                        (turning to Ethan)
                Sit down, sit down.

     Ethan sits.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Let's you know what they think of saints,
                doesn't it?  Damn near set me on fire on
                my way over here.  As if I haven't been
                burned enough today.

     A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is
     going to blow between these two.  Then civilly:

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Sorry I barged in on your vacation.

                                ETHAN
                Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.

                                SWANBECK
                Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.

                                ETHAN
                Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.

                                SWANBECK
                Why did you phrase it like that?

                                ETHAN
                Like what?

                                SWANBECK
                'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

                                ETHAN
                You gotta be kidding.

     Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD, and
     projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is:

     VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH

                                NEKHORVICH
                        (with exaggerate brio)
                Well, Dmitri!  How are you?..

     Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply.  Ethan smiles.

                                ETHAN
                ..I'm fine..and you?

                                NEKHORVICH
                I'm fine..

     Ethan laughs.

                                ETHAN
                I'm fine and you're fine..

     With Ethan simultaneously whispering:

                                NEKHORVICH
                I'm fine too.. I'm fine and you're fine - do
                you remember, dear fried, how you got
                Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr.
                Strangelove and we gave you the name of that 
                silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know
                your name?..In those days, you not only
                saved our lives, you saved our sanity.  'Now,
                then Dmitri - we have this little problem':
                Every search for a hero must begin with
                something that every hero requires; a 
                villain.  Therefore, in a search for our
                hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster
                Chimera.  I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney
                and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.
                However we travel, I must arrive at me
                destination, within 20 hours of departure.
                Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for
                now prudence dictates that I communicate
                nothing but the gravest urgency.
                I fear I can entrust this to no one but
                you, Dmitri.  as we say, 'I'm sorry and
                you're sorry'..

     Swanbeck stops the DVD.

                                SWANBECK
                Let me ask you something.  You have any
                idea what the hell he's talking about?

     Ethan smiles.

                                ETHAN
                An idea, yeah.

                                SWANBECK
                Like?

                                ETHAN
                Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a
                hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a
                commercial carrier.  So let's get on with
                it.  He's still in Sydney?

                                SWANBECK
                Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his
                colleague, Gradski, but that happened
                earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight
                from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..

     Ethan sits back, heavily.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                - Hunt, are you listening?..

     Slowly looking up:

                                ETHAN
                If he didn't want to go anywhere without
                me, how did you get him on the flight?

                                SWANBECK
                You were there.

     Swanbeck clears his throat.  He turns back to the computer and 
     punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.  File open to computer scans
     of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and
     comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat,
     as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy
     scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image.

     ETHAN

     slowly looks up at Swanbeck.

                                SWANBECK
                When I couldn't find you, I had to replace
                you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.
                He double you, what?  Two, three times?

                                ETHAN
                Twice.

                                SWANBECK
                What did you think of him?

                                ETHAN 
                You know we had reservations about each
                other.  Isn't it a little late in the day
                to be asking me that?

                                SWANBECK
                Not necessarily.

     Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain.

                                SWANBECK
                Airline record list Captain Harold
                Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.  as
                far as the media and all governmental
                agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh
                died on the flight, but in fact he missed
                it.  He did, however make the next flight -
                in cargo, stuffed into a rather small 
                suitcase considering his size.

     Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially
     obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Someone on that flight planned an
                operation designed to down the plane and
                make it look like an accident.  Someone
                skillful enough to bring the whole thing
                off without a hitch but - they don't
                always get your luggage on the plane, even
                when you fly first class.

                                ETHAN
                So there's one thing we know Ambrose
                doesn't.

                                SWANBECK
                Then you do think it was Ambrose.

     Ethan barely nods.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                And you're not surprised.

     Ethan gives Swanbeck a look.

                                ETHAN
                Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean
                wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
                that he took it.

                                SWANBECK
                Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
                innocent passengers?

     Ethan smiles.

                                ETHAN
                Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
                he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

                                SWANBECK
                The question is why?  What was this
                Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?

     Ethan rises and moves to the window.

                                ETHAN
                Right now only Ambrose knows that.

                                SWANBECK
                In any case, you've got to recover Chimera
                and bring it to us.

                                ETHAN
                In order to do that, I've got to figure
                out how he plans to make money with it.

                                SWANBECK
                - right.  In fact since the plane went
                down our banking sources have confirmed a
                marked increase in the stock pilling of
                cash in terrorists accounts.

                                ETHAN
                'Terrorists?'

                                SWANBECK
                Well you know Nekhorvich's history.
                You're the one who got him out of the
                Soviet Union was it still in bio-
                weapon business.

                                ETHAN
                If that's what you're thinking Ambrose
                would have set up a bidding situation with
                any number of buyers before he got on the
                plane.  Locating him in time to stop
                something like that - 

                                SWANBECK
                - is where Miss Hall comes in.

                                ETHAN
                        (blindsided)
                Excuse me?

                                SWANBECK
                Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
                which he took very seriously.  She walked
                away and he's wanting her back ever
                since.  We believe she's our surest and 
                quickest way of location him.

                                ETHAN
                        (acidly)
                And then what?

                                SWANBECK
                Then makes sure she continues to see him.
                Gets him confide in her and report to
                you.

                                ETHAN
                You made it sound as if I was recruiting
                her for her skills as a thief.

                                SWANBECK
                Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the 
                wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking
                her to resume a prior relationship, not do 
                anything she hasn't already done.

                                ETHAN
                She's got no training for this kind of
                thing.

                                SWANBECK
                Go to bed with a man and lie to him?
                She's a woman.  She's got all the training
                she needs.

     Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.

                                ETHAN
                I don't think I can get her to do it.

                                SWANBECK
                You mean it'll be difficult.

                                ETHAN
                Very.

                                SWANBECK
                Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt.
                It's mission impossible.  Difficult should
                be a walk in the park for you.  If you can
                think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose,
                you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you
                might want to take a look at these..if you
                have any further qualms about getting her
                to do the job.

     He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the
     one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security).  Swanbeck sets it on
     the table.  Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.

     EXT - BAR (NIGHT)

     A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever
     more lively crowd.  as he does:

                                STREET VENDOR
                Senor, senor!  Your flowers.

     The vendor holds up the spring bouquet.  Ethan seems genuinely
     surprised by them.

                                ETHAN
                Yes.  They're very nice..

     And he's lost in the crowd, leaving a very puzzled vendor holding
     the bouquet.

     STILL OF CRASH SITE IN ROCKIES (THRU MINOLTA STILL CAMERA)

     One after the other flashing by.  They are more evocative than
     specific in their suggestion of an abrupt, fiery, ending, where
     the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart
     and strewn over a desolate landscape.

     NYAH

     carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee
     table.  She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the
     lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto
     the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of
     champagne chilling.  There's a light breeze the fire from the
     burning effigies throwing smoke and flame all over the city.

                                NYAH
                What's the population of Seville any
                idea?

                                ETHAN
                Five, six-hundred thousand.

                                NYAH
                There's nearly 2 million in London.

                                ETHAN
                And six billion in the world.

                                NYAH
                That's lot of people out there..how many
                of them, I wonder, are capable of
                something like that?

                                ETHAN
                Sean Ambrose, for one.

     A long shocked moment.  Nyah laughs.

                                NYAH
                Right...

     INT - SAFEHOUSE (EVE - LATER)

     The pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room
     Nyah's back to Ethan:

                                NYAH
                        (grimly amused)
                Not that it matter much but..I seem to
                recall you staying something like, 'I was
                hoping we could work together.'

                                ETHAN
                This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.

                                NYAH
                But it is what you'd like me to do.
                so tell me to do it..

     She approaches Ethan.  They're inches apart.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Come on, out with it.  Tell me to go and
                insinuate myself back into Sean's life.

                                ETHAN
                Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's
                life.

                                NYAH
                I'd like a little more conviction..

                                ETHAN
                So would I.  But it's not mine to give.

                                NYAH
                        (archness there)
                You've either got it or you don't.  Let
                your conscience be your guide?

                                ETHAN
                Something like that.

     With a smile and a wink.

                                NYAH
                But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a
                bloody thief.

                                ETHAN
                You can be a thief and have a conscience.

                                NYAH
                No.  You can be a thief and have a
                conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to
                tell me about this!
                        (pouring herself a drink)
                What do I have to do to get away from this
                guy?  When you're with him, he messes
                about with your head every waking
                moment..even now I'll be at some out-of-
                the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a 
                bottle of Crystal shows up at the table,
                with two glass, God knows how he finds 
                out at any given moment where I am in the
                world but he does.  And it looks like he's
                done it again.  You know his definition of
                a  true paranoid?

                                ETHAN
                I don't.

                                NYAH
                Someone in possession of all the facts.
                        (she turns away, pauses)
                Are you telling me I have to do this?

                                ETHAN
                Generally, I don't favor coercing someone.
                Not when there's a chance my life could
                end up in their hands.

                                NYAH
                And that's the only reason?

                                ETHAN
                Can you think of a better one?

                                NYAH
                Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or
                that..somehow in the course of business
                this got personal as well as physical.

                                ETHAN
                Look, would it make you feel better if I
                didn't want you to do this?

                                NYAH
                Much.

                                ETHAN
                Then feel better!..

     Long moment while she looks at him.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Well.  That made all the difference in the 
                world, didn't it?

     Ethan walks out onto the balcony.  She looks at his back.

                                NYAH
                Sean will never be anything but suspicious
                if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm-
                not-nad' message.  Not after the way we
                broke up.

                                ETHAN
                What wouldn't make him suspicious?

                                NYAH
                Probably that I needed him in some urgent
                way..destitute - in serious trouble..the
                kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..

     Ethan's been smiling slightly.

                                ETHAN
                Serious trouble, Nyah, is something I can
                always arrange..

     NYAH IN A SPANISH JAIL

     standing for front and side mug shot.  O.S. sound of teletype
     continues.  SUPERIMPOSE:  Ethan holding up something the size of

                can be picked up only by our computer.

     On the screen of the GPS computer, a little yellow blip appears
     pulsating on the screen.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                When it's in your ankle we can track you
                within three feet of anywhere in the 
                world.

     OVER ETHAN AND ONTO COMPUTER SCREEN

     He types a small Interpol bulletin stating that Nyah Nordoff
     Hall, apprehended March 13 in Seville, is awaiting extradition
     while the authorities in London, Paris, and Amsterdam squabble
     over where she's going to be tried first, for the various thefts
     and burglaries she's committed in the three cities.

     COMPUTER SCREEN (AMBROSE TENT ANNEX - DAY)

     Ambrose picking up on a version of the Interpol bulletin Ethan's
     put out.  He leans over the screen for a moment, then moves to
     the window, and stares out thoughtful at the bay, almost as if
     he were watching...

     where Nyah is allowed out for an airing, seemingly alone but

                Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but
                I guarantee he's monitoring every law 
                enforcement agency in the world, for what
                they might be saying about him, if nothing
                else - he's got the ability and, we
                assume, the desire to get you out of
                there.

                                NYAH
                This doesn't seem to be accomplishing
                much.

                                ETHAN
                Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is
                keeping a very capable thief off the
                street..

                                NYAH
                Very funny..maybe he has heard and
                doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost
                interest.

                Stop and look for something in you
                purse..kneel down..

     She does.  They're effectively blocked from the street.

                How can you possibly?  I've got to get

                                ETHAN
                You don't trust me.

                                NYAH
                Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor
                judge of character.

                                ETHAN
                He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's
                going to be delayed.

                                NYAH

                                ETHAN
                You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose
                you.

                                NYAH
                Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll
                take care of myself because if push comes
                to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without
                giving two week notice.

                                ETHAN
                Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while
                we're at it, be especially sensitive to
                any sudden change in Ambrose's plans,
                especially any involving you..

     They rise.  A quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone.  A look of
     something like longing replaces the toughness as she gazes after
     him, then starts across the street toward the limo and driver.  MI
     music theme kicks in and continues over:

     Luther's feet.  Luther looks down to see that he is standing in a
     pile of sheep-shit.

                                LUTHER
                Thanks - mate.

     Both men laugh and all three move to:

     INT - FARMHOUSE (DAY)

     Luther and Billy with Ethan setting up their operation.  There's
     a blip on one of the screens.

                                LUTHER
                It's the transponder.

                                ETHAN
                Put in the coordinates and let's get a 
                visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.

                                LUTHER
                The satellite doesn't work as fast as I
                do.

                                BILLY
                Yeah, I've heard about you, Luther, and I
                just want to tell you it's an honor and a
                pleasure to be working with you blokes,
                whoaa!  That's some transponder!

     As Billy speaks, the visual come on line and Nyah has become
     visible.

                                LUTHER
                        (a jaundiced eye, to Ethan)
                It certainly is.  How did we get so lucky?

     Ethan pointedly ignore the question.

     POV - MOVING (PALM BEACH - DAY)

     rounding the tip of the bay's crescent, revealing the beach and
     dock at Ambrose's palm-lined residence.

     NYAH

     The speedboat's engine's are cut.  Nyah looks momentarily
     stricken.

     POV NYAH (MOVING)

     a lone slender figure silhouetted at the end of the dock, still
     as the piling besides which it stands.  But the features remain
     obscured by the sun at his back.

     ETHAN

     leans forward as the slender figure grows larger,

                                BILLY 
                        (to Ethan)
                Is it him, then?

     POV - MOVING

     The tide is too low for the boat to dock, making it necessary for
     he boat to approach the shore.  The slender figure moves off the
     end of the dock and onto the beach.

     THE CIGARETTE

     idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the
     sand - the boatman grumbles he can't get any closer.  The slender
     figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light
     changes - Ambrose is waiting.

     Nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side
     into thigh-high water without taking her eyes off Ambrose.
     Ambrose strides right on into the bay.  as they are just an arm's
     length apart:

     NYAH

     takes a deep breath, presses the button to scramble the
     transponder.

     WITH ETHAN (INT. SHEEPFARM SAFEHOUSE)

     The picture abruptly goes dead.

                                BILLY
                Damn.  Just when it was about to get
                interesting.

                                ETHAN
                It's okay.  She scrambled the
                transmission.  Luther, continue feeding
                the GPS her position.

     Luther punches in.  The signal - and the global coordinates are
     given.  They wait.

     INT - SPACE

     The satellite positions itself.

     WITH THE THREE
        
                                ETHAN
                Can't we speed this up.

     Luther shoots him a disgusted look.

                                LUTHER
                With what?  This is the only computer
                that'll do this.
       
     THE SIGNALS AND PHOTOS

     start to bounce back, growing larger and larger on the screen,
     until:  Nyah can be seen, water up to her thighs, lingering in
     Ambrose's arms with each blow-up, and linger.  And lingering.

                                BILLY
                - right.  Now there's a bloke who knows
                how to deliver a proper welcome.  Don't
                get me wrong, mate.  You were quite
                hospitable.  Is it him, then?

     Ethan's look suggests he's worried about lapse in recruiting
     judgment.

                                LUTHER
                It is, Billy.

                                BILLY
                Then we got'em!

                                ETHAN
                We don't know what we've got because we
                don't know what he's got, where he's got
                it or what he's doing in Sydney with it.

     Ethan strides away from the screen, the edge in his voice and the 
     move not altogether lost on either Luther or Billy.

     INT - THE BAY (EXT. PALM BEACH - DAY)

     Perfectly poised, still loosely in his arms, Nyah returns
     Ambrose's penetrating gaze with a pleasant, clear eyed one.

                                AMBROSE
                Not much luggage.

                I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly
                grateful, Sean.

                                AMBROSE
                How grateful?

                there..how in the world did you ever find me?

                                NYAH
                How do you that.

                                AMBROSE
                Magic...

     looking down the length of the dock.  Ambrose, his arm around
     Nyah and carrying her suitcase, moves up the dock toward the
     house and camera.

     Stamp steps into the annex and looks over to Wallis, who watches 
     Nyah on the monitors.

     INT - ETHAN - SAFEHOUSE (SHEEP FARM - DAY)

     Ethan watches the Nekhorvich video on the computer screen.

                ...therefore in a search for our hero,
                Bellerophon, we created a monster,
                Chimera.

     Ethan then flips through a series of pictures on the computer
     depicting the myth of Bellerophon attacking Chimera.

     Billy moves up behind him.

                                BILLY

     INT - AMBROSE'S (DAY)

     They've reached the head of the stairs.  Ambrose opens a door.
     It's a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the
     tent annex and the beach, and a very large bed.

                                NYAH
                Your room.

                                AMBROSE
                        (yes)
                Mmmm.

                                NYAH
                And my room?

     A long moment.  Ambrose walks to a mirrored wall.  The mirrors
     are sliding doors.  With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the
     mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer
     clothes.

                                AMBROSE
                Thought you could use a little something
                to wear.

     Nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe.  Ambrose pulls out a
     slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed.

                                AMBROSE ( cont'd)
                Try it on..

     Nyah hesitates.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Go ahead.  I'm dying to see if I 
                remembered your size..

     Nyah picks it up.

                                NYAH
                No changing room?

     Ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits.  Her blouse,
     belt, skirt, fall on the bed.  As her slender arm reaches down to
     pick up the Armani:

     AMBROSE

     grips her wrist, the flimsy Armani dangling in the air.

                Oh, I am.  Later..

     The Armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor.

     CLOSE - ETHAN (DUSK)

     standing off to one side, listening to Nekhorvich's voice.

                                NEKHORVICH
                ..therefore in a search for our hero,
                Bellerophon, we created a monster,
                Chimera.

                                LUTHER
                Why's Nekhorvich going on about an old Greek myth?

                                ETHAN
                Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA
                molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed
                Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head
                of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
                plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich
                has created a monster virus in Chimera and 
                apparently the means to kill it in
                Bellerophon.

                                LUTHER
                That simple, huh?

                Damn, you're beautiful..

     Nyah reacts as if she'd been rapped on the nose, her eyes
     moist.  She turns abruptly to camera.

                                NYAH
                Did you say something?

     AMBROSE

     A brooding Ethan exits the sheep farm safehouse under a setting
     sun.

                Now we'll see what chance it has.

     Ethan stops, looking out over the broken plain.  His voice is
     heard overlapping into the next scene.

                                AMBROSE
                Twenty-four mil..

     Ambrose's hands shift to another photo of another newspaper, the
     LONDON TIMES, this one piled high with English pounds and the
     written amount: 37 million pounds.

                                AMBROSE'S VOICE
                Thirty-seven million pounds.  That's a
                promising bid.

     The third photo is of the AFTERNOON ARUBAN, with $14 million
     packaged on it.

     Ambrose, wearing a robe and seated at a glass-topped table, sets
     this last photo on the table on top the others.  He picks up
     Nekhorvich's digital camera, removes the film disk, and snaps it
     into its plastic case. He places the case into an envelope
     (NOTE: The same envelope seen at the track) and hands it to
     Stamp.

                                AMBROSE
                We'll need this at the track.  Well then.
                Sorted.

     Stamp is seated near him.  Glances toward Ambrose's bedroom and
     Nyah asleep in Ambrose's bed.

                                STAMP 
                        (pointedly)
                Not everything.  Why do you think she's
                really here?

                                AMBROSE
                From her point of view or mine?

                                STAMP
                Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she
                left you six months ago..The question is,
                do you trust her?     

     As he speaks, Ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his
     robe.  Takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the
     cigar; the razor-sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar 
     like a guillotine.

                                AMBROSE
                One considers her timing, of course -
                getting nicked within a week of the plane
                going down.  Suggestive, even borderline
                suspicious, but hardly conclusive.

                                STAMP
                Well, you've thorough about it, at any
                rate.

     Ambrose opens the cutter again to clean off the fragments of
     tobacco trapped by the cut.

                                AMBROSE
                Tell me, Hugh.  You don't exactly hang on
                Nyah's every word and gesture, do you?
                Fairly ratty nail, that.

     Sean touches the nail of Stamp's left pinkie finger.  Stamp
     reacts by slightly withdrawing his hand.

                                STAMP 
                Sean..

     With his left hand Ambrose grabs Stamp's left wrist.

                                AMBROSE
                You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug 
                for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?

                                STAMP
                Sean, please..

     Sean pulls Stamp's hand closer.

                                AMBROSE
                Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse
                sent in by IMF to spy in us, why should I
                deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two?
                Or don't you think I can learn more from
                her than she can from me?

     Ambrose twists Stamp's wrist so that Stamp drops to one knee
     trying to alleviate the pain.

                                STAMP
                        (in pain)
                I do!..

     Ambrose leans in close to Stamp's face as he places the cutter
     around Stamp's pinkie.

                                AMBROSE
                Now Hugh, you must realize that some of us
                have the burden of sex to deal with..and
                my dear chap.  I may or may not know why 
                she thinks she's here, but I'm willing to
                take the risk, because Hugh, I am gaging
                for it..

     Ambrose closes the cutter on Stamp's finger and cuts the nail,
     just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood.  Stamp
     cries out.  Ambrose tosses Stamp a napkin, light his cigar and
     exhale.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Don't ever question my judgment again.

     EMPTY FRAME (EXT. RANDWICK RACE TRACK - DAY)

     with no sound, the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until
     horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the
     sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting and gasping for
     jostling and going to the whip, the sound of the crowd
     overwhelming all but the announcer's voice carrying everyone
     around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing,
     controlled frenzy.

     Billy hands her a chest sheet and moves on.  She opens it to the
     fourth race.  Taped onto 'Naturally Vain' is a small plastic
     piece with the note.  she regards the note, places the plastic
     piece in her ear.

     ETHAN'S POV (THRU GLASSES)

     moving from Nyah to the champagne bar just behind where Ambrose
     is seen greeting someone in the crowd and they sit at a corner
     table in front of the window overlooking the track.

                Near as I can tell, there's at least a
                half-dozen other blokes about the place.
                Maybe more.  Hugh Stamp, an old mate of
                Sean's, is the only one I recognize, bit
                of a creep and then some..

                We know him.  He's over your left

     POV RANGE FINDER BILLY

     and from his point of view it can be seen that Ambrose is talking
     with John McCloy, the head Biocyte.  Ambrose takes an envelope
     out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small
     plastic container marked 'S.G.' (Identical to the object first
     seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security.)  He opens it
     and removes a small shiny object about the size of a quarter.  He
     turns to the window and gestures.  Stamp enters the bar.

     wafer-like object to Stamp who places it in a small camera, hands
     it back to Ambrose and exits, waiting just outside the glass
     door.  Ambrose hands the camera to McCloy who looks puzzled.

                Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how

     direction:

                Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not
                happy about.

     McCloy puts the camera down.  The two men have words.  McCloy
     shakily leave the table.  Ambrose opens the camera.

     While Ambrose is still juggling the drinks, Nyah reaches into his
     trouser pockets, and rummages around.

                Hold on.

     Ambrose grabs her arm, and she almost drops the envelope she's
     just lifted.  (NOTE: It is important not to see her actually lift
     it).  She's holding it, pinned between her right arm and side.  As
     it's slipping, she notes Stamp above her, looking down and has to
     conceal what she's holding from him as well:

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)

                                AMBROSE
                What else?

     She takes it and as she does the envelope falls, but she manages
     to catch it with her left hand, blocking the move with her body
     as she does.

                really - aggrhh!..

     Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds
     himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.  If he'd been welded
     there by a band of steal he'd have more room to maneuver.

                                STAMP
                Say again?

                                BILLY
                Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh...

                                STAMP
                Whatever you're about in future, watch
                your step.  Never know who you might run
                into...

     Stamp looks around, Nyah's nowhere in sight.  He's lost her.  Sees
     his hand's bleeding and lets Billy go, who nearly drops to the 
     floor.

                                STAMP
                Where's the loo then?

                                BILLY
                        (pointing up)
                - aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh...

     Stamp heads up the men's room.

                                BILLY
                        (croaking it out)
                ...

     Shakes his head, feeling lucky to escape with his life.

     EXT - PADDOCK - BETTING TABLE TWELVE

     Nyah into shot.  Stands in line.  She looks around.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                How'd you do?  Don't turn around.

     Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye.

                                NYAH
                I managed.

                                ETHAN
                You noticed.  What're you going to do?
                Spank me?

     She slips Ethan the envelope.  Ethan himself returns the look,
     holding it in spite of:

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Stamp's out of the loo.

     Luther arrives, with the camera, opening for Ethan.  Nyah turns
     away.  Ethan pulls out the tiny memory card, slips it in the 
     camera.

                                ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        (looking into camera)
                This is going to take a couple of
                minutes..

     LUTHER

     is racing back to the van.

                                LUTHER
                There in twenty, Ethan..

     NYAH AND ETHAN (IN LINE)

     edge toward the window.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Stamp's a little shaky, but headed your
                way, mate.

                                ETHAN
                Copy that.
                        (to Nyah)
                Who do you like?  In the race?

                                NYAH
                        (nervous, she's heard Billy
                        too)
                What race are we talking about?

     INT - VAN (DAY)

     A sweaty Luther:

                                LUTHER 
                I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                He's heading down the stairs, now..

     Ethan places the digital camera on play and begins to go thru the
     stills.  As they cliff off, Ethan is visibly affected.

     LUTHER IN THE VAN

     watches the stills as well.  He's no less affected.

     ETHAN WITH NYAH

     He mutters some expletive under his breath, then, evenly:

                                ETHAN
                I want you out of Ambrose's place.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                He's one tier from the bottom.

     Ethan glances over to the bottom of the stairs.

                                NYAH
                What are you talking about?

     As he lowers camera and removes the memory card.

                                ETHAN
                I want you out of there.

                                NYAH
                Why?  What's happened. What did you see?

                                BILLY
                Thirty steps..

     Slipping card back into envelope.

                                ETHAN
                Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even
                the best of snake charmers get bit.

                                NYAH
                Ethan, tell me -
                                
                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Twenty, nineteen..

     Ethan's been talking to someone he's been urging to walk, not run
     to the nearest exit.  Now he drops all pretence:

                                ETHAN
                I want you out of Australia!
                        (more quickly)
                ..I don't know how much more plainly I can
                put it.

                                NYAH
                How do you suggest I go about it?

                                ETHAN
                He's touched your heart.  You're
                overwhelmed.  You need to think it over.
                You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If
                You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in
                and getting you out.  Give me the ear
                piece.

     She just gets it out of her hear and gives it to Ethan when she
     reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet.  She gives
     him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off -
     no more bets.  Flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops 
     the envelope.  She quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it,
     tucking it away and looking up - to see Stamp standing over her.
     almost exactly where Ethan had stood when she looked away.

     NYAH

     tries not to register alarm while she gauges how much Stamp had
     seen.

                                STAMP
                Get your bet down?

                                NYAH
                Just..

     She rises.  Stamp waits only a moment then follows.

     AT THE PRIVATE BLEACHERS (DAY)

     everyone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch.

     Ambrose is watching the race through binoculars.  Nyah comes up 
     behind and puts her arms around him.  With her left hand she puts
     the envelope into his right jacket pocket.

                                AMBROSE
                Your nag is making a run for it on the
                outside!
                        (lowering binoculars)
                Bloody hell, Nyah!

     She's momentarily startled.  Then:

                                AMBROSE (CONT'D)
                You picked another winner!

                                NYAH
                Well, that's good, isn't?

     A BLOW UP (INT. SHEEP FARM IMF SAFEHOUSE - DAY)

     of a shot from a digital camera card.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE
                Dr. Segi Gradski, Nekhorvich's
                colleague and lifelong friend..

     The photos is coded with the data in the lower left hand corner,
     01.27.99, the time in the right, 10:02:56 A.M.  Burned into the
     photo is '20 hours, 03 minutes after exposure.'

     Ethan paunches in.

                                ETHAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
                Twenty hours and three minutes after
                exposure.
                        (sotto voce)
                Twenty hours.

     Ethan doesn't say anything for a moment, then goes on to the next
     photo on the card: '25 hours, 40 minutes after exposure.'  It's
     Gradski again.  Gradski's eyes are darkly circled, his skull look 
     mottled.

                                ETHAN
                Six hours later.

     Another photo: '31 hours, 30 minutes after exposure.' Gradski's
     bleeding from nose, mouth and ears, the skin eruptions are
     pervasive, his body an open wound.

                                ETHAN ( cont'd)
                Six more hours.

     The next photo.  '34 hours, 25 minutes after exposure.'  Gradski's
     body at rest.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Three hours after that, Gradski was dead..

                                LUTHER
                Here's a victim from the Bruny Island
                outbreak.

     The victim's face shows a devastation undeniably like Gradski's.

     A long, long moment as Ethan, Luther, and Billy sit in silence.

                                BILLY
                Oh, happy day.

     Ethan looks again at the first photo of Gradski.

                                ETHAN
                Nekhorvich said 'However we travel, I
                must arrive at my destination within 20 hours
                hours of departure.'

     CLOSE - NYAH (EXT. AMBROSE VERANDA - LATE AFTERNOON)

     Nyah is on the balcony.  Ambrose enters with two glasses of 
     champagne.  

                                AMBROSE
                To Australia.  It's made so many convicts
                feel at home.  Here's hoping it does the
                same for you..

     He laughs.  She doesn't.

                                NYAH
                Sean, there's something I've been meaning
                to talk to you about... Isn't going to be
                easy for me to say.

                        (jocular)
                Then don't say it.

                                NYAH
                I don't know what to do about you, Sean.
                I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.

                                AMBROSE
                To do what?

                                NYAH
                Sort it all out.

                                AMBROSE
                And you're going to have time.  There's
                been a change of plans.

                                NYAH
                A change of plans?

                                AMBROSE
                Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner
                tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you
                don't mind.

                                NYAH
                Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.

                                AMBROSE
                Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after
                you.

                                NYAH
                Lovely.

     INT - AMBROSE STUDY (LATE AFTERNOON)

     Ambrose enters, slips off his jacket and hangs it over a chair.
     He walks to a desk and brings up a computer the Biocyte website
     and McCloy infomercial.  Stamp notes that Ambrose is 
     on the computer and moves to the desk.

                                STAMP
                I thought you were going to dinner.

     Stamp leans over and pulls out the envelope.  As he does he sees 
     Ambrose has pulled up and started to play McCloy's informercial.

     limo.

     Michael at the wheel.

     INT - LIMO - MOVING (EVE)

     McCloy doesn't like the taste of the cigar, goes to toss it out
     but the electronic window button doesn't work.  He notices the
     evening paper partially open on the seat.  His name leaps out. He
     opens the paper

     THE HEADLINES

     announce that John C. McCloy, CEO of Biocyte, Inc., one of the
     world's leading pharmaceutical companies, has died of a straight
     and terrible strain of influenza

     Shocked, McCloy drops the paper, calling out:

                                MCCLOY
                George.  George.  George.

     The drover doesn't turn around.  McCloy can't believe it.  He
     bangs on chauffeur window.  The driver turns on the air
     conditioning in the rear of the limo.  McCloy clutches his throat
     and passes out.

     MCCLOY (INT. ICU UNIT - NIGHT)

     regains consciousness.  He's got tubes coming out of every
     orifice and is contained in the equivalent of a plastic bubble.
     Drenched in perspiration and he looks around for a call button.
     He grips the side of the bed.

                                MCCLOY
                Bloody room..just..shut your eyes, shut
                your eyes.

     He can't resist.  Opens them to look up thru the plastic to see:

     NEKHORVICH

     a shimmering blur coming in and out of focus.

                                MCCLOY (cont'd)
                I'll be buggered!..What's this then?


                                NEKHORVICH
                A visit from an old friend.

                                MCCLOY
                What's happening here?  You're dead!

                                NEKHORVICH
                Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little
                extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear
                Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure
                he has less than ten hours to live.

                It was in the bloody papers, on the

                                NYAH
                International, please.  I'd like to make a
                reservation on the next available flight tonight.

                                OPERATOR
                Where to?

                                NYAH
                Where is next available flight going?

     The operator answers.

                                NYAH
                Fine.  I'll take it.

     She hangs up, goes to the door.  The house is eerily silent.

     POV - STAIRWELL (NIGHT)

     a play of shadows, the sound of the kitchen fridge.

     CLOSE - NYAH

     Moves softly downstairs & hesitates at bottom, glancing about.

                                NYAH
                Ulrich?..Ulrich!...

     Silence.  she goes into the kitchen.  No one.  She goes out the door.

     OVER NYAH'S SHOULDER - MOVING (EXT. SYDNEY - NIGHT)

     running pell-mell down to the shore.  Stops.  Looks outside the
     small skiff moored at the end of the dock.  It's dark and she
     decides to chance it.  She moves onto the pier, trying to glide
     by the boathouse.  A figure darts out and grabs her.  She tries to
     scream but can't.  The figure whips her around and she sees:

                                ETHAN
                Easy, easy, easy, shhh!

                                NYAH
                Oh Ethan!..

     She throws her arms around him.

                                ETHAN
                Are you okay?

                                NYAH
                I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get
                me out of here.

                                ETHAN
                It's going to be okay.

     He holds her.

     INT - HOSPITAL ROOM

     McCloy's strapped down, but manages to reach the call button and
     push it.  Again and again.

                                NEKHORVICH
                No use, my friend.  The medical staff
                wants no part of this.  Doctors don't
                fancy the idea of dying any more than
                anybody else.

     McCloy stares at Nekhorvich for a long moment.

                                MCCLOY
                How could I possibly be infected?

     Nekhorvich shrugs.

                                NEKHORVICH
                That's exactly what Gradski said - 27
                hours before he died.  With Chimera, the
                most minute exposure can be fatal.

     McCloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor.  He grips
     the edge of the hospital bed.

                                NEKHORVICH
                But then you shouldn't be feeling to ill.
                not for another three of four hours 
                anyway.

     McCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety.

                                MCCLOY
                You have Bellerophon.

                                NEKHORVICH
                        (mildly)
                Do I?

                                MCCLOY
                You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need
                it?

                                NEKHORVICH
                        (amused)
                'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred
                people on Bruny Island that you
                deliberately infected with Chimera needed
                it as well.

                                MCCLOY
                Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to
                be treated with Bellerophon within twenty
                hours?

                                NEKHORVICH
                By asking me.

                                MCCLOY
                You still don't get it, do you?  You want
                to make an omelet, you break a few eggs -
                I needed to know just how bad the disease
                was - in the real world, not the lab.  And
                you never know til you try.  You thought
                you were genetically splicing together
                strains of influenza to create a 
                cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you
                creating a disease so terrible in Chimera
                that the cure would be priceless.

                                NEKHORVICH
                You wanted the disease in order to peddle
                the cure.

                                MCCLOY
                Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed
                Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For
                hero to be appreciated, you need a monster.
                Now that's not so difficult to understand, is
                it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could
                knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not
                anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it
                takes to float one little pissy boutique
                antibiotic that's barely effective against one
                strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes 
                money killing the microscopic little shits that
                are out there, you'd help me put one out there
                I can make on!..there it is.  I've
                confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business
                to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding
                Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even
                know where to put the money they're making on
                Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do
                a thing for me even at twice the recommended
                dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a
                a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated
                and let's go back to work!..

                                NEKHORVICH
                You know, I think it's a little late for
                that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if
                you see him.
                
     INT - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE MCCLOY'S ROOM)

     Nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask, and the vocal
     oscillator, revealing an exhausted Ethan.  Angle widens to
     include Luther and Billy in hospital greens.

     Luther and Billy nod in disgusted assent.

     EXT - ANNEX (NIGHT) NYAH

     holds tight in her embrace with Ethan.

                                NYAH
                Ethan, you know what frightens me most
                when I'm with him?..the thought of never 
                seeing you..how are we getting out of here?

                                ETHAN
                Nyah, it's very important not do
                anything to alarm Ambrose..

                                NYAH
                What?  You told me to get out of here.  I
                thought you were here to collect me.  I
                was so relieved.

                                ETHAN
                        (with growing urgency)
                No time to explain.  You've done well,
                and we're so close.  So close.  It's
                critical that you do whatever Ambrose
                asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon..
                That's a promise.. Come on, now off you
                go!

     He gives her an affectionate smile and she reluctantly heads back
     to the house, her expression troubled, even suspicious.

     INT - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE MCCLOY'S ROOM)

     Having just taken off the mask, Ethan stands with Luther and Billy.

                                LUTHER
                        (disgusted by what he's heard)
                So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's
                got Chimera.

                                BILLY
                There guys are walking around with
                different halves of the same dollar bill?

                                ETHAN
                Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich
                on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera
                virus.

                                LUTHER
                Yeah.  Why else would he come back to
                Australia?  If he had them both, he could
                sell them anywhere.

                                ETHAN
                I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting
                on a cure without a disease.

                                LUTHER
                You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..

     EXT - AMBROSE HOUSE (NIGHT)

     Ethan enters and tears off his mask, revealing Ambrose filled
     with implacable rage.  He looks up to see Stamp who's been
     obviously waiting for him.  Tearing the voice oscillator.
     Leaning with both hands on a counter-surveillance monitor table
     he stares at the floor, his face rictus of hateful intensity.

                                STAMP
                You were right.  Hunt stung McCloy
                tonight.  He knows.  They'll be going into
                Biocyte...

     Ambrose looks up slowly to Stamp who's been standing by.

                                AMBROSE
                Good..then we go where he'll be, don't 
                we?  Well done, Hugh.  Well done.

     CHAUFFEUR'S WINDOW (INT. LIMO - EVE)

     being rapped on by the driver.

     MCCLOY 

     wakes with a start.  The window's lowered -- Billy's in livery.

                                BILLY
                You're home, guv'ner.  Home..

     It's taking time to register.  Then:

                                MCCLOY
                - where's George.  My regular driver.
                Where is he?

                                BILLY
                Took ill, guv'.  Touch of the flu. They
                say it's going around.  Nasty business.
                Mind you don't catch a chill now.

     Still dazed, McCloy manages to nod and exit the limo.  Billy
     drives off.

     CLOSE - COMPUTER SCREEN - BIOCYTE BUILDING BLUEPRINTS
     (INT. SHEEP FARM SAFEHOUSE)

     including all specifications.

                                ETHAN
                Luther, do you have the building up and
                running?

     Luther punches in and up comes a squat little island a hundred
     yards off shore, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                That's not exactly it.

                                LUTHER
                Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their
                storage structure..

                                ETHAN
                Nyah still on the property?

                                BILLY
                She hasn't left it.

     Then:

                                LUTHER
                Okay, here you go -

     As Luther speaks, the building - on his computer graphics, one
     with the BIOCYTE PHARMACEUTICALS ELEVATORS AND RENDERINGS, is
     being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the
     rendering specifications by Luther, as if the building itself
     were being constructed at a madly rapid pace, from its foundation
     to its reinforced steel structure, to its honeycombing of floors,
     to its outer skin.  Luther's reconstitution of the building lot
     static, but moving around and above it even as he proceeds.

                                ETHAN
                Let's start from the inside out.

                                LUTHER
                All storage and production of Chimera is
                done here, in this lab on the forty-second
                floor, the heart of the building.

     BIOCYTE LAB

     Only about eight personnel -- chemists in lab coats, workers in
     bio-containment suits, etc. -- populate the lab, passing through
     security door and air locks, monitoring the virus stock, pading
     the injection gun, etc.

                                LUTHER'S VOICE
                Chimera itself is kept in two places: in
                production vials in an incubation room and
                housed in a small airtight chamber - inside
                three injection guns.

                                BILLY'S VOICE
                Mate, you kill it in both places, we're
                laughin' and we go home.

     WITH LUTHER AND ETHAN

                                ETHAN
                Now how to get in there.

                                LUTHER
                No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by 
                five guards on rotating patrol.

                If you look at Hunt's operational history, he
                invariably favors misdirection and deception.
                For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the
                ground where he has to risk confrontation
                with security.

                                ETHAN                        
                Not going in from the ground.  Show me the
                atrium.

     INT - BIOCYTE ATRIUM SHAFT

     The height and extent of the atrium are revealed, as well as its
     conclusion in a glass floor in the ceiling of the lab.

                                LUTHER'S VOICE
                        (unhappily)
                The atrium?  One of a kind.  Runs down the
                center of the building.  Provides 24-hour
                natural light via mirrors and daylight
                storage cells.  Optimal growing conditions
                for the virus.  Ends in a glass floor which
                doubles as part of the lab's ceiling.

     WITH LUTHER AND ETHAN

     Luther sees the glint growing in Ethan's eye.

                thirty seconds at night, the Civil
                Emergency alarms are tipped.  Those even I
                can't stop.  Thirty seconds total to get
                you in and the cable out.

                                ETHAN
                I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done
                at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's,
                I'm going in and getting her out.

                No, Hunt will prefer to engage in some
                sort of acrobatic insanity to enter
                Biocyte somewhere through the atrium where
                security is minimal..

     ETHAN'S DESCENT

     is so swift it appears as though he's going to hit the atrium
     louvers but as he reaches roof level they crack open just enough
     for him to dart thru like thread thru a needle

     Luther begins the countdown.  His countdown continues, running
     under the action and dialogue below.

     Ethan streaks thru the beams of light toward the atrium floor.

     INT - ATRIUM FLOOR - ETHAN 

     reaches the end of the cord, slows himself to a stop and sees 
     the security guard through the window. The guard starts as he 
     catches a glimpse of Ethan's reflection in the control panels.

     Ethan swings himself up to the ledge above the guard's window, 
     putting himself out of the puzzled guard's sight.

                Gotta get that cable out. 

     Ethan unhooks the cord and flips to the atrium floor.  An alarm
     goes off.

                There it goes.. 

     Still confused and concerned, the guard doesn't immediately react 
     to the alarm or the ringing phone.  He finally answers the phone.

                AY!  what's the matter with you?  Can't you 
                hear the alarm's gone off in cosmetics? 

     The first guard gives up what's confused him.

     Ethan drops onto the lab floor and heads across the lab and up

     INT - INCUBATION ZONE

     In front of each of three large television monitors is a vial
     shaped roughly like a sealed beaker somewhere between one and two
     liters in size.  Each one is contained behind Plexiglas and each 
     one pale yellow, one sunset red.  Behind them are monitors marked,
     respectively:  WORKING SEED STOCK, MASTER SEED STOCK, IN VITRO
     VIRUS.  Behind these is a monitor screen with a blow-up of the
     contents of the vials & the magnitude of the blow-up - 950,000x.

     These are X-Ray microscope blow-ups, i.e., allowing the viewer to
     see the motility of the virus and its metabolism, not dissimilar
     to an MRI this of Chimera in its three different cultures..

     Ethan's on the computer controls, racing thru to WORKING SEED
     STOCK, which calls for optimal levels of 6.9 pH and 11 
     degrees Celsius.  He drops the pH to zero and punches up the
     temperature to a hundred.  The effect on the greenish hue in
     the bottle is subtle but immediate - not so subtle is the
     effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically - they
     immediately appear agitated, their microscopic DNA innards
     contracting and expanding.

     Ethan moves on to the Master Seed Stock and the In Vitro Virus
     panels on the computer.  The changes he makes are reflected on
     the digital monitoring panels before each viral container.

     THE WORKING SEED

     vial has begun to change colors from sea green to a paler pea-
     green.  The liquid itself begins to thicken:

     injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below, one of
     Ambrose's team runs to grab it, but before he can reach it he is
     shot by Ethan, who's falling to the floor below.

                                AMBROSE
                        (to Ulrich)
                Get it.

     As Ethan hits and dives for cover, Ulrich goes for the gun
     Ethan shoots Ulrich in the leg.  Ulrich hops back in pain.

                                AMBROSE
                Those were two explosions, your van and
                your safehouse, in case you didn't hear
                them both -- I believe that means you've
                also lost a friend.

     Ethan's crouching on the ground protected behind a series of
     vertical metal sheets.

                                ETHAN
                And you couldn't walk to tell me about it.

     Ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the
     shattered glass on the floor.  Ambrose, Wallis, and a couple of
     other Ambrose team members fire, kicking up broken glass.  Ethan
     backs off.

                                AMBROSE
                        (yelling)
                Hold your fire, dammit!

     The two spot one another in a mirror on the far wall of the hot
     zone..

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Well, Hunt.  How've you been?
                
                                ETHAN
                        (smiling)
                Fight a bit of a cold..

                                AMBROSE
                And you're happy about that?

                                ETHAN
                Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell
                you.

                                AMBROSE
                You know, that was the hardest part of
                having to portray you.  Grinning like an
                idiot every fifteen minutes.

                                ETHAN
                I would've thought the hardest part was
                exercising restraint.  Curbing that
                pressing need of your to get your gun 
                off.  You were in such a hurry to knock
                off that 747, you never figured out where
                the virus really was.

                                AMBROSE
                I knew where it was.

                                ETHAN
                Oh.  then you knew the only way 
                could smuggle the live virus to the CDC
                scientists in Atlanta was by injecting
                himself and using his own bloodstream as a 
                Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty
                hours so he could take the anti-virus and
                still have it be effective.  You knew that
                while you were knocking him off and
                destroying the very thing you came for.

     Ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen
     round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a
     spray of gunfire, attempting to cover his own effort to the reach
     the injection gun.  The return fire nearly hits the injection
     gun, kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the
     floor.

                                AMBROSE
                Stop!  Put a sock in it!  Hit that bloody
                gun and you'll spray the bloody virus all
                over the place!

     Everybody's regained cover but the injection gun remains out of
     everybody's reach.

                                ETHAN
                There it is, guys, the last of it.

                                AMBROSE
                Yep.  You've provided us with a golden
                opportunity to have both the bug and the
                bug killer.

                                ETHAN
                What was the top bid?

                                AMBROSE
                Why, you going to make me a better offer?

                                ETHAN
                Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not
                really.

                                AMBROSE
                        (not amused)
                Somebody's been slipping you our mail.
                Come on out here, you bad girl.

     Nyah walks out into view on her own.  Ethan sees her reflection in
     the mirror.  Enraged, but trying to control it.

                                ETHAN
                She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.

                                AMBROSE
                She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for
                you, Hunt.  from this moment you're
                responsible for what happens to her, and
                if you're looking out for her well-being,
                I suggest you advise her to pick up the
                gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your
                court, Hunt.  What've you got to say?
                Nyah's waiting for your answer.

     A pregnant pause.

                                LUTHER'S VOICE
                        (breaking through the static)
                Ethan, Nyah's in the building!  Do you 
                copy?

     WITH LUTHER (EXT. BIOCYTE)

     a mess amid the rubble of the construction van.

     ETHAN

                                ETHAN
                        (dryly)
                Thank you.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Sure he won't shoot you the minute he's
                got it?

                                AMBROSE
                Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah
                responsible for her actions..

                                ETHAN
                In other words, you're calling her a
                flake.

     CLOSE - NYAH

     listening.

                                AMBROSE
                You know women, mate.  Like monkeys, they
                are.  Won't let go of one branch til
                they've got a grip on the next...get it,
                Nyah.  I'll cover you.

     Ambrose cocks his weapon.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                I'm waiting.

                                NYAH
                        (not much more than body
                length from Ethan)
                This isn't exactly working out the way you
                thought it would, Ethan.  Sorry.

     Finger on the injection trigger, she rises and turns the barrel
     on her arm, firing.  The sound of the air pressure pushing the
     virus into her is unmistakable, as is the circle of tiny puncture
     wounds on her skin.  Nyah moves in front of Ethan, covering him,
     as she turns to face Ambrose.

     ETHAN

     shocked by Nyah's gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he
     resets the 'Countdown' on his chronometer to twenty hours.  As
     it drops into the nineteen:

                                AMBROSE
                        (frustrated in the extreme)
                You..bitch!

     She's been laughing away with Ethan:

                                NYAH
                You're not going to shoot, Sean.  Not
                this bitch.  She's worth thirty-seven
                million pounds.

     CLOSE - ETHAN'S HANDS

     fingers press a red button on a tiny detonator.  There's a bright
     heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water --
     the plastique killing any airborne virus.

     Ethan uses the diversion to grab Nyah and run with her to the far
     side of the lab, behind a stock of horizontal cylinders.

     INT - LAB

     Ambrose and team recover from the explosion and begin firing on
     the tanks protecting Ethan and Nyah, surrounding the two with
     fire and jets of released steam.

     INT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH

     behind the stack of tanks.  Ethan launches an explosive down a
     short hallway, blowing a hole in the building's exterior wall.

     INT - ENTRANCES TO THE LAB

     A group of Biocyte security guards enter from behind Ambrose and
     team and catch them off-guard.  All hell breaks loose.

     INT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH

                                ETHAN
                        (outraged)
                What did you think you were doing!

                                NYAH
                I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep
                you from getting hurt, that's all.

     This hits Ethan with the force of a blow.

                                ETHAN
                - you who don't have a conscience.

                                NYAH
                        (something of surprise to
                        her)
                I guess I lied..You can't get both of us 
                out of here, can you?

                                ETHAN
                No.

                                NYAH
                Then you'll have to kill me before it's
                too late.  Before I start killing people.

                                ETHAN
                No.

                                NYAH
                I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you
                don't have a choice.  Just do it now.

     She puts Ethan's gun to her forehead.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                For god's sake, get it over with.

     THE HAMMER

     pulls back.

     CLOSE - ETHAN

     He can't fire, lower the hammer.

                                ETHAN
                We've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before
                you start killing anybody.  I'll get 
                Bellerophon into your system by then.
                Just stay alive.  I'm not gonna lose you.

     Ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall
     once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambrose's
     team, wounding a couple men.  He reaches the wall and dives thru,
     camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in
     the air all around him.

     Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute
     deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it.

     PANNING SHOT - PAINTINGS (INT. CULTURAL ARTIFACT CENTER)

     of Aborigine paintings, eerie patterns made of man and nature
     phantasmagorical, like the patterns that form under the eyelids
     shortly before sleep.  B.G. the haunting notes of didgeridoo
     insure they're not being overheard.

                                SWANBECK
                        (reading the paintings titles)
                'Dreaming of Birds and Flying Fox,'
                'Bushfire Dreaming,'  'Wind Dreaming,' --
                oddly appropriate -

     Swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle
     weary Ethan:

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                - since it appears that Chimera, the
                mother of all nightmares is on the loose
                somewhere around here - is there any way
                this disaster can be viewed as a qualified
                one?

                                ETHAN
                        (tight-lipped)
                Not yet.  We did manage to pull any
                sensitive equipment and material out of
                our safehouse wreckage.

                                SWANBECK
                We could lock down passport control and
                all ports of authority, but that won't
                stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't
                know who else we're looking for -- all 
                terrorist bank accounts of which we're
                aware are stable.  No deposits, no
                withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.

                                ETHAN
                We think we've got our finger on the 
                buyer.

                                SWANBECK
                Do you?  Even assuming you're able to
                prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've
                now got an additional problem.  You
                destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If
                Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now,
                he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so
                of Miss Hall's blood to market.

                                ETHAN
                Yes, I believe that's right.

                                SWANBECK
                But that leaves another seven or eight
                pints of Chimera.

                                ETHAN
                You mean that leaves Miss Hall.

                                SWANBECK
                Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my
                understanding is that 20 hours after
                exposure, the victim becomes infectious.
                Highly infectious.

     Ethan glances at his chronometer.  Swanbeck sees it.

                                SWANBECK (CONT'D)
                You noted the time of exposure?

     Ethan nods.

                                SWANBECK (CONT'D)
                - good.  Then if you manage to get hold of
                Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've
                got -
                        (glancing at the chronometer)
                - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three
                seconds to destroy the largest remaining
                source of Chimera on earth.

                                ETHAN
                She sacrificed herself..

                                SWANBECK
                Brave girl.  If you can get hold of
                Bellerophon with the time limit, you may
                spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in
                either case you've got less than nine
                hours to kill her or cure her.  After that
                it's out of our hands and a matter of
                worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However
                you obtain it, we want you to preserve a
                sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.

     Ethan's staring at Swanbeck.

                                SWANBECK (CONT'D)
                Something else?

                                ETHAN
                Aren't you even curious?  About why she
                did it?

                                SWANBECK
                No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And
                neither can you, Hunt..

     As the eerie wail of the didgeridoo seems to mount in volume and
     intensity, the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems
     particularly oppressive.  Ethan's up against it and he knows it.

     A VIEW OF SYDNEY

     from harbors to skyline in all its sunlight splendor.

     Nyah sits for a moment, looking steadily at Ambrose.  Ambrose pats
     the cannister he's carrying.

                                AMBROSE
                Feel like pleading for your life?

                                NYAH
                        (with an edge)
                Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

     Ambrose slaps her.  With scarcely a flicker of hesitation she
     slaps him back.

                                AMBROSE
                God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why
                did you save that bastard?

                                NYAH
                If it'll make you feel any better I won't
                do it again.

     in the ceiling.  Stamp and Ethan pull their guns on one another.
     They're in a face-off until they both agree to drop their guns,

     As Ethan raises his hands, he pulls the pin on a grenade and then
     kicks it between Stamp's legs.  The handle flies off:  It's live.
     When Stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade, Ethan kicks out
     his gun.

     Trying to escape the grenade, Stamp smashes into Ethan and seems
     to have hit him in the jaw.  Both hit the ground as the grenade
     explodes, with Stamp appearing to have the upper hand.

     Luther hears nothing in response but while noise.  He looks to
     Billy and indicates there's no answer.

                Well, mate, maybe this is one of those

     Ethan appears as if he wants to respond, but can't.  Ambrose
     kicks him again.

     Ambrose standing before Hunt with a pair of fully loaded
     Berettas.  The sound of the helicopter grows.

                - right.  We don't have a lot of time,
                Hunt.  whatever you've got to say, say it
                now.

     Ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only
     manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which
     continue as:
        

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Sorry mate, I can't understand a bloody
                word.  How about giving us a big smile to
                remember you by?
                        (hearing the helicopter)
                No?  Well, then.  This is what's known as
                getting your gun off.

     With that Ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two
     Berettas into Ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor.
     McCloy nearly faints, and Ambrose laughs at his squeamishness
     until something on Ethan's body catches his eye: the top of the
     little finger on the right hand is bleeding.  Ambrose grabs
     Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes
     wide open and thoroughly lifeless.  His jaw, under the mask had
     been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape Ethan has
     used to mount the drain-pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Bloody hell!

     He looks around, but Stamp is gone.  So is the cannister and
     kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before.

     EXT - BEAR ISLAND

     Ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair
     of security guards are frantically trying to close.

     Billy and Luther in the copter are over the island, and bank so
     Luther can fire a grenade launcher and blow the back of Ambrose's
     boat.

     The guards close the gate, Ethan runs the motorcycle up the
     hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge.  Ambrose follows
     in the SUV, crashing thru the gate.

     They race across the bridge and the road, onto the huge
     greensward opposite to and similar in shape to Bare Island.
     There, with the helicopter hovering, Ambrose manages to corner
     Ethan and after they expend whatever ammunition their weapons
     hold, they move into each other bare handed and engage in
     ferocious, no-holds-barred combat, the helicopter hovering low
     enough to keep away whatever's left of Ambrose's henchmen, the
     chopper's downdraft hitting them and flattening the grass around
     them.  Ethan prevails.

     EXT - BEAR ISLAND GUN PIT - ETHAN

     runs into the central 'hole' area, guns in both hands and
     wearing the kevlar vest.  He runs toward the walled edge of 
     the enclosure and jumps.  As he pulls himself up the top of
     the wall, he sees the IMF helicopter approaching.

     A gunman appears from the tunnel entrance and opens fire, the
     bullets exploding into the wall around Ethan, who jumps out
     of the way to avoid them.

     EXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER

     dive out of its path before a second motorcycle comes up over
     the hill.  Ethan flips backwards and fires his pistol,

     The motorcycle flies over Ethan, who runs after it and jumps
     on, revving the throttle and taking off.

     hits the Falcon's trunk, lifting its back wheel off the ground,
     but the Falcon keeps coming, its trunk ablaze.  Luther reloads as
     a gunman leans out the window, firing up at Ethan on the hill.

     Michael's SUV arrives and tears through the gate and flames,
     followed by Wallis' sedan and then Ambrose, riding a motorcycle.

     Before an intersection, Ethan both revs and brakes, spinning the

     Wallis breaks hard, but not hard enough:  he stops just in the
     path of an oncoming 18-wheeler.  His car's demolished.

     EXT - ROADWAY - ETHAN AND SUV

     Ethan pulls out of the smoke as the SUV bursts out of the scrub
     behind him, striking the rear of the cycle.  Ethan puts his bike 
     into a spin and pulls his gun, ending up alongside the SUV
     passenger window.  He fires through the window, shooting both
     Michael and the bodyguard.

     The SUV veers off, crashing into a line of parked cars.  It hits
     the first car and flips up and over, landing upside down on
     several more parked cars.  Ethan speeds off on his smoking cycle.
     Ambrose arrives and then takes a side road.

     Ethan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub.  Back
     on the main road, Ambrose roars off to intercept Ethan.

     On a clifftop clearing, Ethan races along as Ambrose moves to cut
     him off.  They head toward one another.

     another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide
     hard in mid-air.  They fall to the ground fighting as their bikes
     skid and Ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them.

     Ethan and Ambrose rush towards one another.  Ethan flips Ambrose
     to the ground.  Ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster.  As
     Ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off

     Ethan and Ambrose rise from the fall.  Ethan jumps up and sweeps
     Ambrose, dropping him to the ground.  Ethan begins strangling
     Ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, Ambrose
     gets Ethan in a choke hold.

     Ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits Ethan in the
     midsection and the face.  Ethan kicks it out of his hand and
     connects with several punches, knocking Ambrose to the ground.

     Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts
     Ethan across the back and face.  Ambrose dives on Ethan and the
     knife is poised above Ethan's eye before Ethan grabs the knife
     and clears, holding it out toward Ambrose.

     Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of
     kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.  Ethan steps
     back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping
     kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his
     hand.

     Ethan's back.

                Hunt.  You should have killed me.

     Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by
     dust from the copter.  Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and
     then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air.  He
     catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.

                It also contained the anti-virus,
                Bellerophon.

                                ETHAN
                Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only
                really effective against Chimera.

                                SWANBECK
                But you were under specific instructions
                to bring back a living sample of the
                Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to
                know how, after you'd managed its recovery
                intact, it subsequently got destroyed.

                                ETHAN
                By fire.  That's the best way, really.


                                SWANBECK
                So you didn't fail mission, you simply
                changed it.

     Ethan doesn't respond.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                It's no longer enough for you to execute
                and implement IMF policy, you now wish to
                go in the business of creating it?

                                ETHAN
                No, I don't.  But in this case -

                                SWANBECK
                In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In
                face, it was a pretty damn good idea.
                Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for
                Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her
                criminal records will certainly be
                expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.

                                ETHAN
                I do.

                                SWANBECK
                Where is she now, by the way?  Do you
                know?

                                ETHAN
                I don't.  No exactly.

                                SWANBECK
                Well, Hunt, what are your plans?

                                ETHAN
                Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll
                let you know where I'm going.

                                SWANBECK
                Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't 
                be a vacation if you did.

     Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance.

                                SKY NEWSCASTER
                This incident in the wake of rumors
                suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and 
                Biocyte's financial difficulties --
                including criminal allegations of insider 
                trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to
                commit fraud, and stock parking -- have,
                understandably, sent stock prices of the
                pharmaceutical company plummeting.

     EXT - SYDNEY (DAY)

     Ethan emerges to a very crowded street.  Billy and Luther are
     waiting.  Both look to Ethan.

                                LUTHER
                        (worried)
                So what did he say?

                                ETHAN
                Good job.  And thanks.

                                BILLY
                        (incredulous)
                That's it?  That's it? That's it?

                                LUTHER
                        (dryly, looking at Billy)
                And the check's in the mall.

                                BILLY
                Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy
                Baird's the name.  Anything you need to
                get, move or watch, I'm your man.

     And Billy's gone.  Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant
     to say anything, both reluctant to leave.

     One quick bear hug, then:

                                LUTHER
                Always nice hearing from you man.  Stay in 
                touch..

     And Luther's off.  Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully.  Then,
     curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd.  After a half-
     dozen steps, something catches his eyes.  He stops.

     One quick bear hug, then:

                                NYAH
                        (a tad wary)
                Do you know me?

     NYAH

     is inches from him.  Without batting an eye.


                                ETHAN
                No.  Should I?

                                NYAH
                No.  You just looked as if you did.

                                ETHAN
                No...

     She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable
     conviction.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                ...just as if I'd like to.

                                NYAH
                Oh.  Well..

     He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for
     hers.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                ..I think that can be arranged.

     Looks around at the swirling crowd:

                                ETHAN
                Let's get lost.

     And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the
     crowd.  Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever
     filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash
     of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on
     its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:

     BEGIN CREDITS:  IMF II - CHIMERA
