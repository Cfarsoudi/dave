          TITLE SEQUENCE

      1   EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT

          The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full
          moon.  A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of
          forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.  The
          property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately
          grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards
          with dogs.


      2   EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

          The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.  A formal-
          dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle-
          eastern dignitary.  Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted
          ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their
          overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal
          detectors by white gloved security staffers.

          The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming
          a kind of rampart.  There is an opening, to a kind of waterway
          or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the
          grounds.  There is a steel grating across the opening.  The
          bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter.

          With the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall
          along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down
          along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a
          glow pulsing under the ice.

      
      3   EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT      
      
          Camera moving toward:  A FIGURE in diving gear working at the
          metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.  One bar has
          already been cut out.  Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to
          the muddy bottom.  Lit now only from the floodlights filtering
          down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and
          swims powerfully along the stone canal wall.

          Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against
          the rippled-glass of the ice above.


      4   EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          A dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large
          boathouse.  There is a faint chipping sound.  The ice breaks
          quietly, and the pieces are slid back.  A head appears, in a
          rubber drysuit hood.  The DIVER slips the regulator out of his
          mouth and turns slowly, scanning...  revealing:

          HARRY TASKER.  Our hero.  Harry floats with just his eyes above
          the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a
          footpath nearby.

          After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins,
          letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock.
          He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse.
          Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky.

                              HARRY
                    Honey, I'm home.


      5   INT. / EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN, MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          Meet Harry's partner, ALBERT "GIB" GIBSON, an overweight twenty-
          year-man with a lived in looking face.  Gib answers Harry via
          his headset.

                              GIB
                    Roger that. 
                         (he covers the mike and
                          turns)
                    Hey, Fize!  Get your butt in
                    here.  Harry's inside.

          Outside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making
          yellow snow and hurries back to the van.  They are parked on a
          winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose
          lights are visible through the trees.

          Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto
          nightvision scope.  The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps
          the grounds, locating the boathouse.


      6   EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit.
          Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders,
          cummerbund and a formal shirt.  He puts a tiny plug, like a
          hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.  A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER.
          Very advanced.

                              HARRY
                    Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you
                    copy?

                              GIB (OVER)
                    It's Talkradio.  You're on the
                    air.

          Harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side,
          containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for
          the ear-piece slung on the other.  He slips on a formal jacket,
          concealing the rig.  Then a final touch.  A little aftershave
          from a tiny plastic vial.

          Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the
          shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.  He looks
          ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and
          his hair slicked back.  He enters the main house through a back
          service entrance.


      7   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                                
          Harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place.
          The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really
          notice.  He finger-tastes a dish as he passes.

                              HARRY
                         (French/ subtitled)
                    This needs more garlic.

          He breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the--


      8   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Here the party is in full swing.  Harry blends smoothly into
          the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid-
          east nobility.  They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money
          and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy
          bankers to playboy arms dealers.

          Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar
          smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a
          canape from the passing waiters.  He nods to someone as if he
          knows them.  Greets another is quite fluent Arabic.  People in
          his wake look at each other like "Do you know him?"   They
          shrug, go on with their conversation.  Harry moves through the
          crowd.  Scanning.

                              HARRY
                    There's Daddy Petrobucks.

          HARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host
          of the party and owner of the chateau.  He is fat and animated,
          greeting guests with a flourish.  As Harry watches he warmly     *
          greets a beautiful WOMAN.  They become absorbed in a             *
          conversation.

          The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out.  There is
          a frank moment of returned interest.  Then the crowd shifts,
          cutting off their view of each other.


      9   INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor.  *
          He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.     *


     10   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          The doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library.  He    *
          crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.         *


     11   EXT. BALCONIES - NIGHT                                           *

          Harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic       *
          prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony        *
          directly above.  He lets himself into--                          *


     12   INT. KHALED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                     *

          Khaled's office is ornately furnished.  Beautiful antiques
          glint in the moonlight coming in the French-doors.  Harry
          crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there.
          Bathed in the glow from the screen, he pulls a FLAT BOX,  about
          the size of a paperback,  from the back of his cummerbund.  He
          connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the
          computer.

                              HARRY
                    Modem in place.  Transmitting...
                    now.

          He pushes a button and a green light comes on.


     13   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib and Faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with DATA
          from Khaled's private computer.

                              FAISIL
                    Affirmatory.  We are in.                               *

          Fast Faisil is a computer ace.  His fingers fly on the keyboard
          as he types rapid key commands.  We see familiar "windows
          appear".  The words are all in Arabic characters.

                              FAISIL
                    These are encrypted files, guys.
                    This is going to take me a few
                    minutes.


     14   OMITTED                                                          *


     15   INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   *

          TIGHT ON LIBRARY DOOR.  It opens a crack and a dental mirror     *
          comes out, looking around like a U-boat periscope.  Seeing the
          coast is clear Harry slips out.  But just as he is closing the
          door, a GUARD rounds the corner ten feet away.  Harry turns
          smoothly.  He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard.

                              HARRY
                         (In Arabic/ subtitled)
                    Where's the john around here?  I
                    have to take a major leak.

          The guard points warily down the corridor.  Harry nods and
          heads that way, back toward the party.


     16   INT. MAIN HALL/ STAIRCASE - NIGHT

          Harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party.
          He is sipping champagne and looking bored.  He sees two
          security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the
          stairs, walkies in their hands.  He turns away as they pass him
          and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief... a
          temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses.

          He senses someone next to him and turns.  It is the WOMAN.  She  *
          is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing.

                              HARRY
                         (indicating the bas-
                          relief)
                    Magnificent, isn't it?

                              WOMAN
                    Yes.  Hi, I'm Juno Skinner.  I
                    thought I knew most of Khaled's
                    friends but I don't believe I
                    know you.

          Harry offers his hand to her.

                              HARRY
                    Renquist.  Harry Renquist.


     17   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database.  He
          scans rapidly for--

                              GIB
                    Skinner.  Skinner.  Come on...

          Gib finds the entry he's looking for.  Juno's picture and data
          appear on the screen.

                              GIB
                    Juno Skinner.  Art and
                    antiquities dealer, specializing
                    in ancient Persia.


     18   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Harry turns back to the fragment of frieze.

                              HARRY
                    This is Persian, if I'm not
                    mistaken.

                              JUNO
                    Very good.  It's sixth century
                    B.C.  Do you like the period?

                              HARRY
                         (shameless)
                    I adore it.


     19   EXT. DOCK/ BOATHOUSE (NIGHTVISION POV) - NIGHT

          Seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards
          shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's
          footprints leading to the boathouse.  He calls to one of the
          other guards, who comes running over.


     20   INT. MANSION - NIGHT

          Harry, still with Juno, hears Gib in his ear:

                              GIB (VO)
                    Harry, we got a problem.  Guards
                    are swarming all over the dock.

          Harry glances up the stairs.  Khaled's SECURITY CHIEF is
          gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a
          walky.  Three SECURITY MEN come down the stairs, scanning the
          crowd.  Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Juno's
          arm.

                              HARRY
                    Do you dance, Ms. Skinner?

          He steers her toward the dance floor.


     21   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib, listening, rolls his eyes.  He looks through the night-
          vision scope.  Guards are running around outside the chateau.
          Harry's stirred up the hornet's nest.  Faisil is still jamming
          at the keyboard.

                              FAISIL
                    Okay, files are unlocked.  I'm
                    in. I'm down, baby.  I got my
                    hand up her dress and I'm going
                    for the gold.  I'm--

                              GIB
                    Just copy the goddamn files!
                         (into his headset)
                    Harry, don't be stopping to smell
                    the roses, now.  You hear me,
                    Harry?


     22   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Harry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor.  She
          responds deftly.  They are well matched.  She parries each of
          his smooth moves with a flourish.  It is a contest of wills,
          and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy.
          Juno is hot.  He bends her back at the waist, then snaps her
          up.  She twirls into the crook of his arm.  Their faces are
          inches apart.  Wow.  The music ends and she gives him a wry
          grin.

                              JUNO
                    Well.  And I thought this was
                    going to be just another bunch of
                    boring bankers and oil
                    billionaires.

                              GIB (OVER)
                    Harry, seconds count, buddy.
                    Ditch the bitch, let's go.

                              HARRY
                    Unfortunately, Juno, I have a
                    plane to catch.

          She slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress.
          She hands it to him, maintaining eye contact.  Serious sparks.

                              JUNO
                    Call me, if you'd like to see
                    some of my other pieces.

                              HARRY
                    I'd like that.


     23   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib can't believe this conversation.

                              GIB
                         (to Faisil)
                    Son of a bitch is with her two
                    minutes and she's ready to bear
                    his children
                         (to Harry)
                    What's your exit strategy Twinkle
                    Toes?


     24   EXT. CHATEAU/ FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides
          confidently through.  He goes down the steps to the broad
          terrace above the motor court.  Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers
          his walky talky and starts after him.

                              GUARD
                    May I see your invitation, sir?

          Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast
          pocket.  A REMOTE DETONATOR.

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Here's my invitation.                                  *

          He pushes the button and--                                       *

          KABOOM!  The  second floor office windows blow out in a fiery
          explosion.  Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace
          before the guard can open fire.


     25   INT. / EXT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away.  He starts the
          van.

                              GIB
                    Aw, shit.  Here we go--


     26   EXT. CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees.
          Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing.  The snow
          explodes around him with bullet hits.

          TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect
          unison.  He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid-
          leap with a crack like a baseball bat.  The dogs drop to the
          snow, wobbling around like they're drunk.

          As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes
          ahead, leaping directly for his throat.  Harry grabs the dog
          and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.  Dog
          Fu.  The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch,
          looking down in amazement.


     27   EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow
          bank and sliding downhill.  He sprints down the gentle slope
          toward the highway.

          Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard
          station beside the main entrance.

          TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with
          lights.  They have lost Harry.  They stop.  A snowbank behind
          them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.  He disables them both with
          vicious street-fighter moves.  Harry looks upslope as--

          A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF
          SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some
          on SNOWMOBILES.  A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of
          swirling snow.  Its xenon lights rake through the trees,
          casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow.

          ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one
          of the disabled guards.  He pops the boots quickly into the
          bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL
          rifles slung across his back.

          The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through
          the forest.  Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols
          zig-zagging among the trees.

          Harry slashes expertly downhill.  He cuts a distinguished
          figure in his black tux.  Automatic weapons fire rips through
          the trees from behind him.  Harry is going flat-out.  The xenon
          light hits him.  A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the   *
          slope into white clouds around him.  Harry slashes, turns,
          weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.  A snowmobile is
          closing in, outflanking him.  He turns toward it, suddenly.
          Hits a mogul.  Uses the air to slash his skis right across the
          rider's face.  The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the
          night.


     28   INT. / EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          GIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide.

          INSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on.
          All he can see are lights and gunfire.

                              GIB
                    Harry, what's your twenty?  I
                    need a position, buddy--

          Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from
          the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly
          downslope.

                              GIB
                    Uh... right!  I'll catch you on
                    the next bend.

          Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road.  Only
          about half can make the jump.  The rest crash horribly.  The
          helicopter thunders overhead.


     29   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry sees the chopper start an attack run.  He comes out into
          the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.  The chopper
          gets suckered in...  trying to hit him, getting right down
          behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an
          explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.  P-P-P-POW!  He
          rakes a burst across the windshield.  The startled pilot
          swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front
          of him.

          K-WHACK!  The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper
          drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.  It slides right
          to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering.

          Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right
          across Harry's path.  Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles,
          comes out of it...  running down the hill like a juggernaut in
          his heavy boots.  He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow.

          Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed
          chopper, which still has its engine running.  The ski patrol
          opens fire from upslope.  Rounds whacking against the disabled
          helicopter.

          Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea.  He jerks the
          unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it.
          It slips over the edge.  He leaps inside as it topples forward
          and slides down the slope.


     30   INT./ EXT. HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail-
          rotor to steer.  The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is
          skiing the damn thing down the mountain.

          The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its        *
          skids.  Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around
          it.  Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees.  A snowmobile hits
          a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.

                              GIB (OVER)
                    Harry!  Where are you!

                              HARRY
                    In the helicopter.


     31   INT./ EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          Gib slides the van around a curve.

                              GIB
                         (deadpan, to Faisil)
                    He's in the helicopter.

          Big is scanning above for the chopper.  Then upslope he sees
          the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees.

          The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes
          through trees, still soaring and-- Gib looks up, screaming as--
          The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and--
          BLAMMO!  It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the
          skidding van...  then slides over the edge and tumbles into a
          rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP!  The fireball lights up the
          night.

          Gib and Faisil jump out of the van.  They look downslope at the
          burning wreckage.

                              GIB
                    Harry?  HARRY?!

                              HARRY
                    What?

          Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them.  Harry is lodged in
          tree-branches hanging over the road.  Gib hands his MP-5K        *
          machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his     *
          hand and pulls.  Harry tumbles down into the snowbank.  He
          stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in
          his ski-boots.  He is completely unruffled.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.  We can still make our
                    flight.

          As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry, TWO GUARD TEAMS
          ON SNOWMOBILES roar around the bend behind them, fish-tailing
          on the ice.  Faisil OPENS FIRE.  One snowmobile swerves over
          the embankment.  The other pulls up broadside, and the guards
          duck behind it.  Gib floors it and the van roars down the
          mountain.  Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto.

                              FAISIL
                    This is GREAT!!  I never get to
                    shoot!

                                                      CUT TO:


     32   EXT. DULLES AIRPORT - NIGHT

          An American Airlines 747 touches down amid puffs of tire smoke.


     33   EXT. SUBURBAN D.C. STREET - NIGHT

          A NON-DESCRIPT SEDAN pulls to the curb in a neighborhood of
          modest middle-income tract homes.  The street is deserted.  It
          is 4 A.M.  Gib is at the wheel, dropping Harry off at his
          house.


     34   INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry is emptying his pockets... passport, business cards etc.
          All documents under his name "Renquist".  He double checks that
          his pants and jacket pockets and empty.  Gib fastidiously puts
          the items into a plastic zip-lock.

                              HARRY
                    Empty.  Go.

          Gib starts handing him items from a briefcase.  This should all
          feel like a tired ceremony between them.

                              GIB
                    Harry Tasker wallet.  Harry
                    Tasker passport.  Plane ticket
                    stub, hotel receipt, Tasker.  Two
                    postcards of Lake Geneva.  House
                    keys.  Souvenir snowing Swiss
                    village.

          Gib snows him how is snows when you shake it up and turn it
          over.

                              HARRY
                    What's this for?

                              GIB
                    For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your
                    kid something.  You know.  The
                    dad thing.

                              HARRY
                    Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick
                    me up at eight.  The de-brief is
                    at ten hundred.

          Harry opens the car door.

                              GIB
                    Hey, hey, hey... what are we
                    forgetting?

          Gib holds up Harry's gold wedding band.  Harry puts it on.

                              HARRY
                    What a team.  See you at eight.

                              GIB
                    Yep.  Sleep fast.


     35   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Harry slips inside.  He sets down his suitcase and walks
          quietly down the hall.  He pauses at a door with lurid labels
          and stickers plastered all over it (Toxic Waste,  STAY OUT!, IF
          IT'S TOO LOUD YOU'RE TOO OLD, etc.)

          Harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping
          daughter, DANA.  She looks like an angel in the moonlight
          coming in the window.  In fact, she is a typical 14 year old
          girl, and therefore hardly an angel.  But to Harry she is
          unflawed.


     36   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Harry, undressed now, slips into bed next to... a lump in the
          covers which we presume to be a human being.  This is HELEN
          TASKER, Harry's wife of 15 years.  He kisses her on the cheek
          and she stirs.  She rolls toward him, giving him a sleepy hug
          and a kiss.

                              HELEN
                         (a drowsy murmur)
                    Hi, honey.  How was the flight?

                              HARRY
                    Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.

                              HELEN
                    Okay.

          As she drifts off, Harry puts his head on the pillow and stares
          at the ceiling.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


     37   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DAY (MORNING)

          TIGHT ON SWISS VILLAGE.  It is snowing.

          ON DANA,  reaching to the present Harry just gave her.

                              DANA
                    Hey, thanks dad.  I never had one
                    of these.

          They are in her room, which is your basic room from Hell.
          Pearl Jam posters, and an unbelievable clutter of junk,
          magazines and cheap jewelry.  Harry kisses her on the cheek, to
          which she submits dutifully.  He looks at his watch and heads
          for the door.

                              HARRY
                    You better hurry.  You're going
                    to be late for school.

          Harry hurries out and Dana considers the Swiss village a
          moment.

                              DANA
                    Really lame.

          She plonks is straight in the wastebasket.


     38   INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM/ BATHROOM - DAY

          Harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but            *
          incredibly ugly dog, GIZMO, who skitters past him going the      *
          other way.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo!                      *

          Harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly
          rushing to get ready herself.  We get our first good look at
          Helen.  She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an
          outfit.  Her hair is wrapped in a towel.  To call her plain
          would be inaccurate.  She could be attractive if she put any
          effort into it, which doesn't occur to her.

                              HARRY
                    I'm late.

                              HELEN
                    Me too.

          They talk without looking at each other, the way people who
          have been together a long time do.

                              HELEN
                    How'd it go at the trade show?
                    You make all the other salesmen
                    jealous?

                              HARRY
                    Yeah.  You should have seen it.
                    We were the hit of the show with
                    the new model ordering system,
                    the one for the 680... how you
                    can write up an order and the
                    second the customer's name goes
                    into the computer, it starts
                    checking their credit, and if
                    they've ordered anything in the
                    past, and if they get a
                    discount...

          She is already tuning him out.  And it hits us:  SHE HAS NO
          IDEA WHAT HARRY REALLY DOES.

                              HELEN
                         (barely listening)
                    That's fabulous Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, it was wild.

          Harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth.
          He smiles.  The best lies are told with enthusiasm.


     39   INT. FRONT HALLWAY, LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Gib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives
          there.  He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy
          Orbison impression.  Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib
          gives him the evil eye.

                              GIB
                    Come any closer I'll kill you.

          The dog backs up, whining plaintively.  Gib throws his jacket
          over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out
          a pack of CAMELS and sets it on the mantelpiece.  He adjusts
          its position carefully.  Hmmmm.


     40   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Harry  and Helen maneuver around each other expertly.  She is
          doing her make-up.

                              HELEN
                    The plumber came yesterday.  He
                    said they have to dig under the
                    slab or something and it's going
                    to be six hundred dollars to fix.

          Harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in
          front of the mirror.  His mind is elsewhere.  He couldn't care
          less about there domestic problems.

                              HARRY
                    Uh huh.  Okay.

                              HELEN
                    It's not okay.  It's extortion.

                              HARRY
                    What did you tell him?

                              HELEN
                    I slept with him and he knocked
                    off a hundred bucks.

                              HARRY
                    Good thinking, honey.

          Harry kisses her on the cheek and exits.


     41   INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Gib enters and pours two cups of coffee.  Dana is drinking
          orange juice from the bottle at the fridge.

                              GIB
                    Hi, kid.

                              DANA
                    Hey, Gib.  What up?

          She EXITS, eating an uncooked pop-tart.  Harry comes in a
          second later and Gib hands him his coffee.

                              HARRY
                    Thanks dear.

                              GIB
                    Here, check these out.

          Gib hands Harry the glasses.  Harry studies them, seeing the
          VIRTUAL VIDEO DISPLAY inside the left lens of the Ray Bans.
          Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking,
          then he puts them on.

          HARRY'S POV - INSIDE THE GLASSES - A black and white video
          image of his own living room.

                              GIB
                    The CCD camera and transmitter
                    and inside a pack of smokes.
                    Slick little unit, huh?

          IN POV we see Dana enter the living room.  She looks around
          carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his
          wallet.  She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts
          the wallet back.  Pro moves.

                              HARRY
                    Son of a bitch!

                              GIB
                    What?

          Harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen.
          Gib goes after him.


     42   EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and
          runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the
          driveway on his idling YAMAHA.  Trent is 16, dressed in grunge-
          rock style, trying to look tough.  Harry comes out the front
          door as Trent revs the motor.

                              HARRY
                    Dana!!

          She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch
          and they shoot down the driveway.

                              DANA
                         (yelling over the
                          engine)
                    Can't stop, I'm late.  Bye, Dad!


     43   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR/ STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY

          They are driving through D.C.  Harry is still shocked by his     *
          daughter's behavior.

                              GIB
                    Kids.  Ten seconds of joy.
                    Thirty years of misery.

                              HARRY
                    She knows not to steal.  I've
                    taught her better than that.

                              GIB
                    Yeah, but you're not her parents,
                    anymore, you and Helen.  Her
                    parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.
                    The five minutes you spend a day
                    with her can't compete with that
                    kind of constant bombardment.
                    You're outgunned, amigo.

          Gib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward
          Lafayette Square.  Capital Hill is behind them.


     44   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DAY                                        *

          Harry and Gib come out of an elevator on the 12th floor.         *
          Behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads    *
          TEKTEL SYSTEMS.  They cross a open floor of cubicle spaces.      *
          There is the hum of activity everywhere.  A normal day at a      *
          normal business.                                                 *

                              SECRETARY                                    *
                    Morning, Mr. Tasker.                                   *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Morning, Charlene.

                              GIB
                    See, kids now are ten years ahead                      *
                    of where we were at the same age.
                    You probably think she's still a
                    virgin--

                              HARRY
                    Don't be ridiculous.  She's only --
                    how old is she?

                              GIB
                    Fourteen, Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Right.  She's only fourteen.

          They go into a corridor.                                         *

                              GIB
                    Uh huh.  And her little hormones
                    are going like a fire alarm.  I                        *
                    say even money that physicist on                       *
                    the bike is boinkin' her.                              *

                              HARRY
                    No way.  Not Dana.

          They stop at a door, like any other along the corridor.  It is   *
          blank.                                                           *

                              GIB
                    Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just
                    a river in Egypt.  She's probably
                    stealing the money to pay for an
                    abortion.

                              HARRY
                    Will you just open the door!                           *

          Gib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the    *
          doorknob.  There is the CLUNK of a SOLENOID LOCK.                *

                              GIB
                    Or drugs.

     46   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          They enter a long corridor, which is featureless except for      *
          video surveillance cameras.  They walk along the silence for a   *
          moment, then .  .  .                                             *

                              GIB
                    Twenty here, fifty there... I
                    figured my wife's boyfriend was
                    taking it.

                              HARRY
                    I thought you moved out.

                              GIB
                    Well .  .  .  I moved back in.
                    My lawyer said it would give me
                    a better claim on the house in
                    the property settlement.  Don't
                    change the subject... you owe me
                    two hundred bucks.

          They approach another door, with a (bulletproof) glass window    *
          in it.  Beyond is a brightly lit room, with a woman sitting at
          a desk... and nothing else.  Gib presses a buzzer.


     47   INT. OUTER SECURITY ROOM - DAY

          JANICE sits at the non-descript desk like a receptionist... but
          she is a highly trained security specialist.  She is also hefty
          through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly
          humorless.  She watches them on a monitor screen as they stand
          outside the door.  Harry and Gib appear as living X-Ray images.
          Their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses.  Janice
          puts one hand automatically on the butt of a .45 tucked in a
          holster riveted beneath her desk.  She buzzes Harry and Gib in
          with the other.

                              JANICE
                    Gentlemen, please idenitify
                    yourselves to the scanner.

          Harry and Gib step up to the combination retinal-thumbprint-
          voice scanners.  Harry presses his thumb against a black-glass
          plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye-piece of the
          retinal scanner.

                              HARRY
                    Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two
                    four.

                              GIB
                    Albert Gibson.  Three four nine
                    nine one.

          Their clearance appears on a monitor on Janice's desk.

                              JANICE
                    Thank you.  You are cleared.

          She stands to give them plastic I.D.  badges which they hang
          around their necks.

                              GIB
                    Janice, how many years have you
                    been buzzing us in?

                              JANICE
                    Ten, Mr. Gibson.

                              GIB
                    And you still reach for your
                    piece every time.

                              JANICE
                    Yes sir.

                              GIB
                    God!  You have no idea how much
                    that turns me on.  I've never had
                    the courage to say this before
                    but... I love you, Janice.

                              JANICE
                    Yes, sir.

          He kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by.  She does not
          react is any discernible way.

          They pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens
          automatically.  Beyond is a kind of airlock... a SALLY PORT.
          Behind a lexan shield are TWO GUARDS armed with MP5s.  They nod
          but do not speak at Harry and Gib pass them.

                              HARRY
                    You better watch it.  She might
                    file on you for sexual
                    harassment.

                              GIB
                    In her dreams.


     48   INT. OMEGA SECTOR INNER SANCTUM - DAY

          Gib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port
          into a large austere atrium.

          ANGLE FROM ABOVE as they cross.  A huge graphic logo covers the
          floor.  Across the center is says OMEGA SECTOR.  In smaller
          print, around the perimeter, is the motto: "THE LAST LINE OF
          DEFENSE".

          They enter a high-tech office space.  It is a maze of glass
          partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles.
          There is a hushed quality here.  People do not joke.  They do
          not hurry.  There are a lot of computer screens displaying
          information from around the world.  It looks like a combination
          of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters.

          Fast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned
          cubicle.

                              HARRY
                    Come on, Fize.  We're late for
                    our butt-grinding.

          Faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them.


     49   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          A dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer
          displays at one end.  Glowering at one end of the long,
          polished table, is SPENCER TRILBY, the chief of Omega Sector.
          Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and J.  Edgar Hoover.

                              TRILBY
                    Jesus, Harry!  You guys really
                    screwed the pooch last night.
                    Please tell me how I can look at
                    this, that it's not a total pooch-
                    screw.

                              HARRY
                    Total is a strong word--

                              GIB
                    There are degrees of totality.

                              FAISIL
                    It's a scale really, with
                    "perfect mission" on one end and
                    "total pooch-screw" on the other
                    and we're more about here--

                              TRILBY
                    Faisil.  You're new on Harry's
                    team, aren't you?

                              FAISIL
                    Yes.

                              TRILBY
                    So what makes you think that the
                    slack I cut him in any way
                    translates to you?!

                              FAISIL
                    Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we
                    got.

          He hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen.

                              FAISIL
                    Jamal Khaled.  We think he's
                    dirty so we raid his financial
                    files...  Check it out...

          Faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the
          data for their raid.

                              FAISIL
                    One hundred million in wire
                    transfers from the COMMERCE BANK                       *

                    activities.  Something big is                          *

                    So far this is not blowing my
                    skirt up, gentleman.  Do you have                      *

     50   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          It is the interior of a huge law office.  Helen works there as
          a paralegal.  She is going to the break room for coffee with
          her friend, ALLISON, a secretary.  Allison is black, younger
          then Helen, and still single.

                              HELEN
                    I mean, it's not like he's saving
                    the world or anything.  He's a
                    sales rep for Chrissakes.
                    Whenever I can't get to sleep I
                    ask him to tell me about his day.
                    Six seconds and I'm out.  But he
                    acts like he's curing cancer or
                    something.

                              ALLISON
                    So I guess you didn't get away                         *
                    for the weekend after all?                             *

                              HELEN
                    Are you kidding?  Harry had to go
                    out of town.

                              ALLISON
                    I'm shocked.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  You know Harry.

          Helen's nerdy boss BRAD, comes up behind her, scowling.

                              BRAD
                    Helen, have you pulled those
                    files yet?  I need them by lunch.

                              HELEN
                    I won't let you down, Brad.

          Brad leaves.

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (under her breath)                                *
                    You little pencil-neck.                                *
                         (to Allison)                                      *
                    So... yo... sista!  D'you do                           *
                    anything interesting?

                              ALLISON                                      *
                    Oh... Eric and I drove up to this                      *
                    little romantic inn, and...                            *
                    pretty much lapped champagne out
                    of each other's navels for two
                    days.

                              HELEN
                    You bitch.

                              ALLISON
                    Girlfriend, you got a man.  You                        *
                    just have to take control .  .
                    .  set up the right mood.                              *

                              HELEN
                    Harry only has two moods: busy...                      *
                    and asleep.

                              ALLISON
                    Then you better do something to                        *
                    jumpstart that man's motor.  You
                    know... wake up the sleeping
                    giant of his passion.

          They both crack up at that one.


     51   INT. OMEGA SECTOR (DATA CENTER) - DAY                            *

          Harry meets up with Gib and Faisil coming from the ANALYSIS      *
          Department.                                                      *

                              HARRY
                    What'ya got?

          The following will play as they wind their way through the rows  *
          of data-analysis workstations.

                              FAISIL
                         (handing Harry a
                          printout)
                    Here, check this out--

                              GIB
                    It's a two million dollar
                    disbursement from Khaled to...
                    Juno Skinner.
                         (Harry raises an
                          eyebrow)
                    Uh huh.  The babe at the party.                        *

                              HARRY
                    It doesn't mean anything.  She
                    buys antiquities for Khaled.

                              GIB
                    Nope.  The art buys are in a
                    separate ledger.

                              FAISIL
                    And this is a little above market-                     *
                    rate for the horizontal bop, even                      *
                    for a total biscuit like her.

                              HARRY
                    Alright, I want a complete workup
                    on her.  Do we know where she is?

                              FAISIL
                    Uh huh.  Right here in river
                    city.

                              HARRY
                    You're kidding.

                              FAISIL
                    She lives in Rome, but she does
                    stuff here the Smithsonian and
                    has a lot of diplomatic
                    connections, so she has offices                        *
                    here.                                                  *

          Gib starts tangoing with an imaginary partner.

                              GIB
                    Sounds like a job for a
                    specialist.


     52   INT. TASKER HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NIGHT (10PM)

          DING!  Harry opens the microwave as his dinner finishes re-
          heating.  He sits down alone at the kitchen table and pulls the
          Saran-wrap off the plate.  Another solo supper two hours late.
          His motions are so automatic we gather that this is the rule,
          not the exception.  Helen comes in from the living room,
          holding the suspense novel she is reading.

                              HELEN
                    I need you to talk to Dana.  The
                    vice principle called and she cut
                    class again this afternoon.

                              HARRY
                    I'll handle it.

          Harry picks up his porkchop and goes out the back door.


     53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

          A basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and Dana is shooting
          baskets in the driveway.  Moths orbit the outside floodlights.
          She sinks one, dribbled back to the foul line.  Harry comes up
          behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands
          poised to shoot.  She turns.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why
                    weren't you in class today?

                              DANA
                    He lies!  I was there!  I was in
                    the nurse's office, cause I had
                    a headache.

                              HARRY
                    You seem fine now.

                              DANA
                    Great!  You're going to believe
                    that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over
                    your own daughter.

                              HARRY
                    I'm not sure what to believe
                    anymore, young lady.  You never
                    used to lie to me.  But lately
                    you don't seem to know the
                    difference between right and
                    wrong.

          Dana studies something really fascinating at the end of a
          fingernail.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, are you listening to me?

                              DANA
                    Yeah, Dad.

                              HARRY
                    You know you can always talk to
                    me.  Right?  Whatever is going on
                    in your life, your mom and I'll
                    understand.

                              DANA
                    Okay, Dad.

                              HARRY
                    You'd tell me if there was
                    something wrong, wouldn't you,
                    pumpkin?

                              DANA
                    I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do
                    I look even remotely like a
                    pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a
                    cupcake or a honeybear either!
                    And you don't understand anything
                    Dad...

          Dana runs into the house, agent.  Hold on Harry, superagent,     *
          unable to comprehend the mind of a 14-year-old.  He looks up to  *
          see Helen at the backdoor.                                       *

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (macho voice)

     55   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

          A BLACK LIMO cruises through a morning fill of bright promise.

          INSIDE, Gib is at the wheel in a chauffeur's uniform.  He talks
          to Harry, riding in the back, without turning.

                              GIB
                    It's all set up...  ghost phones
                    and fax, all the usual stuff.
                    You have a suite at the Marquis
                    Hotel under Renquist.  Okay,
                    reality check.  Go.

                              HARRY
                    Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--


     56   INT. JUNO'S OFFICES - DAY

                              HARRY
                    --corporate art consulting
                    company in San Francisco.  I have
                    an appointment with Ms. Skinner--

          Harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as
          Juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor.  She is dressed
          sharply and looks as stunning as Harry remembers.

                              JUNO
                    Harry!  I thought I might see you
                    again.  I just didn't  except you
                    to call so soon.

          Juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake.

                              HARRY
                    Well, what's the point of
                    waiting?

                              JUNO
                    I agree.

          There is definitely unholy magnetism here.  She indicates for
          Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of
          offices.  There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in
          niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and
          tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls.

                              JUNO
                    So your clients want something
                    for the lobby of their new
                    corporate headquarters?

                              HARRY
                    That's right.  They want
                    something...  dramatic.  I spoke
                    to a number of people who said
                    you're the one to see.

          Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area.
          There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates.  An
          overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces.  There are
          massive columns, and statues two stories high.  Even the entire
          facade of a tomb.

                              JUNO
                    So what did these... people...
                    say about me exactly?

          They stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move
          around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment.  Most
          of the workers are middle-eastern.

                              HARRY
                    Let's see... that you can read
                    ancient Sanskrit without having
                    to sound out the words.  And that
                    other dealers and archeologists
                    don't like you much.

                              JUNO
                    Those wimps.  It's because I use                       *
                    my diplomatic contacts to export
                    cultural treasures from countries
                    which tell them to take a hike.
                         (yelling in Arabic to
                          two workmen)
                    I told you to move those crates
                    an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's
                    get going.

          We realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from
          nearby.  He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid-
          thirties.

                              JUNO
                    You see, a lot of these pieces
                    are from ancient Persia.
                    Unfortunately, ancient Persia is

                    most popular places lately.  So
                    I've had to become an expert in
                    international diplomacy.

          Juno stops and looks at Harry.  Her smile indicates the
          possibility of more than just business.

                              JUNO
                    Well, do you see anything you
                    like, Mr. Renquist?

                                                      CUT TO:


     57   INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

          Harry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the MARQUIS
          HOTEL.  It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the
          city.  Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an
          electronic DETECTOR.

                              HARRY
                    She's importing stuff from all
                    over the mid-east.

                              GIB
                    She could be moving money, guns.
                    Anything.

                              FAISIL
                    And the second you left there, we
                    started getting calls to the                           *
                    ghost numbers.  They were
                    checking out the Renquist front.

                              HARRY
                    Okay.  Let's step up the
                    surveillance on her.  Put on two
                    more guys.


     58   INT. JUNO'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

          WE FOLLOW the WORKMAN we saw watching Harry earlier.  He
          catches up with Juno, who is going through the doors to the
          office area.  His name is MALIK.

                              MALIK
                    Ms. Skinner?  Can I speak to you
                    for a moment please, in your
                    office?

          His manner is self-effacing.  Humble.  He doesn't meet her
          gaze.  She nods and they go into the private office.


     59   INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

          MALIK comes in behind her and closes the door.  The moment they
          are away from public observation, his manner changes.  His
          humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he
          approaches her.  Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE
          FACE.

                              MALIK
                    You stupid undisciplined bitch!

          Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive.

                              JUNO
                    It's a good thing you pay me
                    well.

                              MALIK
                    Do you realize that there are
                    surveillance teams watching this
                    place right now?  Your phones are
                    almost certainly tapped.  And you
                    are busy laughing and flirting
                    like a whore with this Renquist,
                    who may be a--

                              JUNO
                    No.  He checked out okay--

          Malik slaps her again.

                              MALIK
                    That is for interrupting.
                         (He backhands her)
                    And that is for being wrong.  We
                    do not tolerate mistakes.

          Juno bites her lip.

                              JUNO
                    What do you want me to do?

                              MALIK
                    Find out who this Renquist it.

                              JUNO
                    How?

                              MALIK
                    Use the gifts that Allah has
                    given you.

          The phone rings on the desk of CHARLENE, Harry's secretary at    *
          Tektel Systems, the permanent front-company for Omega Sector.    *

                              SECRETARY
                    Hello, Tektel Systems.  Mr.                            *
                    Tasker's office.


     61   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DUSK

          Helen is in the kitchen, showing Dana how to put icing on a
          large birthday cake.

                              HELEN
                    Hi, Charlene?  It's Helen.  Is he
                    there?


     62   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DUSK

          Charlene doesn't hesitate a microsecond.

                              CHARLENE
                    Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs.
                    Tasker.  Let me try him in there.
                    Hold please.

          She punches a key, engaging a digital scrambler and connecting
          to--


     63   INT. SUITE AT THE MARQUIS - DUSK

          A PHONE RINGS.  Gib opens his briefcase and looks at the
          console of the cellular scrambler-phone inside.  The display
          reads TEKTEL/CALLER ID POS -- TASKER, HELEN.                     *

                              GIB
                    It's Helen.                                            *

          Harry picks up the phone.  INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING WITH HELEN.

                              HARRY
                    Hi honey.  What's going on?                            *

                              HELEN
                    Sorry to bother you in a meeting,
                    but you have to promise me that                        *
                    you'll be home at eight.  I don't                      *
                    want Dana and I sitting here by
                    ourselves like we were last year.
                    You promise?

                              HARRY
                         (laughing)
                    Baby, I said I'd be there.
                    Really.  Trust me.
                         (the room phone RINGS)
                    Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.

          RING.  Harry raises an eyebrow as he answers.

                              HARRY
                    Hello?  Oh, Juno, hi.
                         (pause)
                    Well sure.  I can be there in
                    twenty minutes.

          Harry hangs up.  Gib, checking his watch, has a look like he's
          got a bad gas pain.

                              HARRY
                    What?  It's on the way.  She says
                    she's got something for me.

                              GIB
                    Yeah, right.


     64   INT. JUNO'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

          A WORKMAN guides Harry through the maze of statuary.  He points
          toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves.  Harry is
          left alone in the vast space.

          Only a few lights are on, rendering the place somewhat Gothic.
          Harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed.  Ahead of
          him, is the huge facade of a royal tomb.  There is a flickering
          light inside.  A shadow moves across the wall in the entryway.

                              HARRY
                    Hello?

          He enters the stone doorway of the tomb.  FOLLOWING HARRY as he
          steps into the inner chamber.  There is an oil-lamp burning on
          a stone sarcophagus, the only light.  The room appears empty.

          REVERSE ON HARRY.  Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed
          alcove.  It is Juno.  She looks ethereal in the strange light.

                              JUNO
                    Hello, Harry.

          Harry whips around, startled.

                              JUNO
                    Do you like my tomb?  The museum                       *
                    financing fell out, so I thought                       *
                    your clients might be interested.

                              HARRY
                    It's certainly... dramatic.

                              JUNO
                    Especially in this light.  This
                    is the only light they had then,                       *
                    so I like to study it this way.
                    I love this place.  I love all
                    ruins.

                              HARRY
                    Is that why you got into this
                    business?

          Juno turns to him in the flickering half-light.  She moves
          closer.  Her eyes seem to glitter.

                              JUNO
                    I've always been a collector at
                    heart.  When I see something I
                    want, I have to have it.

                              HARRY
                    And you have a reputation as
                    someone who gets what she wants.

          She is very close to him.  Her eyes seem to glitter in the
          light from the oil lamp.  She is unbelievably beautiful.

                              JUNO
                    Yes, I do.


     65   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is sitting in the car, in the shadows, up the street...
          with his earphone in place.  Listening.

                              GIB
                    Harry, this is your conscience
                    speaking...


     66   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

          Juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall, holding it up
          so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas-relief
          figures to life.  Stone faces shift and change, stone eyes
          move.

                              JUNO
                    Look at this.  People who dies
                    twenty centuries ago.

          Juno presses her cheek against the cold stone.  She runs her
          fingers slowly across the figures.  It is strange and erotic.

                              JUNO
                    They breathed and loved and wept,
                    just like us.  And now their
                    ideals, their religions, their
                    social orders... are gone like
                    mist.  What did any of it matter?

          She crosses to Harry.

                              JUNO
                    I only hope they lived well.
                    That they got what they wanted.

          She puts her hands on him and pulls herself close.  It is a
          hypnotic moment.

                              JUNO
                    Getting what you want is the only
                    important thing.

          She kisses him, very lightly, with infinite sensuality.


     67   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

                              GIB
                    Harry?  Listen to the following
                    code word.  Helen.  H-E-L-E-N.
                    Now, do you want me to I beep
                    you?


     68   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

          Harry breaks the kiss... slowly pulling back.

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              JUNO
                    Yes what?

                              HARRY
                    Uh, yes, it is important.

          Juno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- BEEP
          BEEP BEEP!!  Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at
          it.  The moment is spoiled.

                              HARRY
                    Uh, it looks like I have to run.
                    I'll call you tomorrow.  Your
                    proposal is very interesting.


     69   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib lets out a big exhale of relief.  He looks at his watch.


     70   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen and Dana are sitting expectantly at the dining room
          table.  There is a big cake, and presents piled on the buffet.
          The food is getting cold.  Helen looks at her watch.

                              DANA
                    See.


     71   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Harry is changing clothes, getting ready to be Harry Tasker      *
          again, as Gib drives through evening traffic.  Gib keeps
          checking the rearview.

                              GIB
                    We have a friend.  Five cars
                    back, inside lane.  They've been                       *
                    on us since we left Juno's.                            *

          Harry adjusts the passenger side mirror.

                              HARRY
                    Station wagon?

                              GIB
                    Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

                              HARRY                                        *
                    No.  We need this lead.                                *
                         (into his Rover)                                  *
                    Unit Seven.                                            *

                              UNIT SEVEN (FAISIL)                          *
                    Seven here.

                              HARRY
                         (into Rover)                                      *
                    I need you at the Georgetown mall                      *
                    in three minutes.                                      *

                              SEVEN
                    Copy that.  We're rolling.

                              GIB
                    Helen's going to be pissed.

                              HARRY
                    See, that's the problem with
                    terrorists.  They're really
                    inconsiderate when it comes to
                    people's schedules.


     72   INT.  STATION WAGON - NIGHT

          There are three men in the car.  YUSIF and MAHMOUD are in the
          front, with Mahmoud driving.  In the back, shadowed, we can
          just make out ABU MALIK.  Yusif is massively built, with a body
          like a beer-keg.  Mahmoud is skinny and intense.

     74   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - MALL - NIGHT

          Harry puts his SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER into his ear canal.

                              HARRY
                    Test two three.
                         (Gib nods, receiving)
                    Pull over here.

          Gib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance.  Half a
          block behind them the station wagon does the same.  Harry slips
          on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car.


     75   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Harry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette.  He
          coughs slightly.

                              GIB
                         (in his ear)
                    You don't smoke, dickhead.

          Harry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of
          cigarettes casually.  He turns his hand.  The tiny lens in the
          cigarette pack glints.

          POV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses.  The
          camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting
          out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away.

          HARRY strolls into the mall.  It is an open promenade design,
          with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers.  Harry
          watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the
          crowd behind him.

                              GIB (VO)
                    What's the plan?

                              HARRY
                         (apparently mumbling to
                          himself)
                    Gonna try to get a closer shot of                      *
                    Beavis & Butthead.                                     *


     76   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib looks in the rearview, studying the car behind him.

                              GIB
                    There's another guy, still in the
                    car.

                              HARRY
                         (on radio)
                    Stay on him.

          All Gib can see is a silhouette in the car.  A soft cherry
          glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark.  No features.


     77   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Harry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway
          between shops.  In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and
          Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they
          track him through the pedestrian traffic.


     78   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib in on the cellular phone.

                              GIB
                    Helen?  Hi, it's Gib.  Harry
                    remembered something he left at
                    the office.  You know Harry.

          As he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the
          station wagon.


     79   INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          She sighs fatalistically.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah, Gib.  I know Harry.

          Helen hangs up the phone just as Dana strides through the room,
          putting on a jacket and heading for the front door.

                              HELEN
                    Where are you going?

                              DANA
                    Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough
                    about us to be here on his
                    birthday, then why should I care?
                    I'm going to a movie.

                              HELEN
                    No you're not.  You're going to
                    stay here until your father gets
                    home and have cake!

                              DANA
                    Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows
                    we exist.

          We see the hurt in her eyes.  She doesn't hate her father.  She
          just misses him.

                              HELEN
                    That's not true, honey--

                              DANA
                    It is true!  He doesn't know
                    anything about me.  He still
                    thinks I'm like ten years old or
                    something.  As long as I just
                    smile and say yes to whatever he
                    says, like his good little
                    fantasy daughter, he thinks
                    everything's fine.  But it's not
                    fine.  Nothing's fine.

          Dana runs out the kitchen by the other door.  Helen runs
          after her.

                              HELEN
                    Dana!  Come back here!

          The slamming door is her answer.


     80   EXT. MALL - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Yusif sees Harry, up ahead, enter a public restroom.  He
          signals Mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on
          the restroom.


     81   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib hangs up the car-phone.  Ten the bus blocking his view
          finally pulls away and Gib see that the station wagon is
          empty.  No silhouette.

                              GIB
                    Oh shit.
                         (into his headset)
                    Harry, I lost the third guy.
                    Harry?


     82   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

          Harry can't answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind
          him.  Harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak.
          Mahmoud goes to the mirror.  Starts combing his hair.  He
          doesn't much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter
          nearby.  Harry is whistling.  Shaking himself.

          HARRY'S POV - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and
          Mahmoud.  Yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring
          both Harry and Mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls.  As he
          passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat--

          Harry spins lightning fast.  He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL
          aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing
          Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shattering a
          urinal.

          Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and
          spins him against the steel stalls.  The silenced pistol goes
          skittering across the floor.

          Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband.  Still holding the
          bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely
          see him move.  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Three .45 slugs  go through
          Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him.  He flops on
          his butt, slumping against the wall.

          Yusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun
          arm.  They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun.
          Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls.  They hit
          a locked door, which pops open, banging inward.

          Yusif drives Harry to the floor.  Harry's head is between the
          shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can, who looks down
          uncomprehendingly at him.

          Yusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe
          of the stall.  He twists Harry's wrist brutally.  He even
          pounds against Harry's hand with his knee.  The old guy winces.
          That's got to hurt.  Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops.
          Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls.

          He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back.  They grapple,
          spinning.  Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  Then he
          elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy
          floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly
          against the rim of a urinal.  In case you haven't noticed, this
          is a messy, nasty fight.  Survival is like that.

          Yusif sags into submission.  Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out
          of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's
          wrists.


     83   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Gib is running full out, drawing his gun.  He has one finger
          jammed in his ear.  His gut is doing the rumba as he runs.

                              GIB
                    Harry?  Harry, you copy?!  Shit!


     84   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

          Harry is pulling Yusif to his feet when the door bangs open
          behind him.  He turns, thinking it is Gib.  It's not.  Malik
          raises a FULL-AUTO BERETTA 92-F and opens fire.  Harry spins
          Yusif between him and the machine pistol.  Yusif's beer-keg
          body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long
          enough for him to dive into a stall.

          Malik hoses the room with the Beretta.  The metal stalls are
          riddled with hits.

          HARRY is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting
          there.  The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on
          the far side.  Harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his
          Glock.

          MALIK goes empty.  Harry hears that and pops out, cranking off
          rounds--

          Malik is a blur going out the door, as Harry's shots shatter
          tiles on the doorframe.  Then silence.

                              HARRY
                         (to the old guy)
                    Sorry.


     85   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          MOVING WITH MALIK, who backs rapidly away from the restroom,
          reloading.

                              GIB (OFF)
                    FREEZE!!!

          Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance
          behind a light-standard.  The terrorist doesn't hesitate.  His
          Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute.

          Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about
          half as wide as he is.  Shots hit all around him, shattering
          window glass behind him.  His stomach sticks out from behind
          the pole.  He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the
          other side.  Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle
          everything behind him.

                              GIB
                    WRONG!  THIS IS NOT GOOD!

          Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck,
          Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians.
          Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there
          are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it.

                              HARRY
                    Get back to the car!

          Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after
          Malik.  Malik is fast and vicious.  He hurls people out of the
          way, sending shoppers sprawling.  Harry is ruthless in his
          pursuit.  They pound through the mall and out onto the street--


     86   EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Malik sprints straight into traffic.  A car screeches, not
          stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.  Harry
          leaps over the hoods of cars after him.  Malik sees Harry
          coming after him like a juggernaut.

          He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street,
          accelerating from a right-turn.  Malik runs at him, clothes-
          lining him right off the bike.  The terrorist picks up the
          nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps
          on.  He pops the clutch and takes off.  Harry pounds after him
          like a locomotive.  He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path
          into a large PARK.  Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal.


     87   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

          ON HARRY, running.  Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.  Harry doesn't
          break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.  The cop
          turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off
          the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet).

                              HARRY
                    Federal Officer in pursuit of
                    suspect!  Sorry.

          Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop
          can get his gut out of the holster to stop him.

          MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.  He looks back,
          amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.  They
          scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs.

          TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.  Malik
          leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees.
          Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling.
          Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it.
          He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the
          last bit of throttle out of it.  They are going flat out,
          through the trees, in a kinetic blur.


     88   EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT

          Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.  The Unit
          Seven car pulls out as well, up the block.

                              GIB
                    Harry, what's your twenty?


     89   EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT

          Harry is legging the police horse hard.  He has his reigns in
          one hand, his Glock in the other.  It's the wild west.

                              HARRY
                    Westbound in the park... suspect
                    is on a motorcycle... he's going
                    to  come out on Franklin.  Hang
                    on--

          Harry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                    I want you on 14th in case he
                    turns south.  And I need Seven on
                    the north side to box him in.


     90   INT. /EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is weaving furiously through traffic.  He slides into a
          turn.

                              GIB
                    Copy that.

                              HARRY
                    And make it fast.  My horse is
                    getting tired.

          ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?"


     91   EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT

          Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street.
          Cars skid around him, out of control.  He turns south.  Weaving
          through traffic.  Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and
          gallops among the spun-out cars.  He goes right over the hood
          on one which is blocking his path.  The driver ducks as the
          horse's hoof cracks the windshield.


     92   EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.  Malik
          goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.  Gib's
          car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes
          barrelling down the street toward him.  Gib cranks the wheel
          the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.  Malik locks
          up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.  Then the
          terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping
          the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT
          REGENCY HOTEL.

          Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them.
          The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with
          bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby.

          HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him.


     93   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

          Acres of marble and red carpet.  Liveries porters.  Guests
          dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women.
          And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with
          Harry charging along behind him.  Malik guns it across the
          lounge, knocking over tables.  He gets air at the top of  the
          steps going up to the RESTAURANT.

          Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself
          careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop.  He gathers
          the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the
          bassist, who is diving for the carpet.  Harry and horse land
          deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after
          Malik.


     94   INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Malik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way
          out.  Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier.
          Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be
          flying at once as people dive out of the way.


     95   INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          MALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees--
          the ELEVATORS.  The door is just closing on one of them.  He
          guns it and slides through the doors.

          HARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of
          Malik as the doors close.


     96   INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just
          been boarded by an older couple.  He has to practically lie
          down on the horse to fit through the door.  The animal barely
          fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be--

          A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel
          as it rises, right to the top of the building.  Harry looks
          through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet
          away.  Malik is inside, punching a button.  He glances up and
          sees Harry.  There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's
          car ascends rapidly.  Malik's malevolent glare is etched on
          Harry's retinas.

          The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's
          panting, snorting horse.  It clomps around the tight elevator.
          The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall.

                              HARRY
                    Can you just press the top floor,
                    please.

          The man nods mutely and complies.  Their elevator takes off,
          rising after Malik's.


     97   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

          Gib runs in with Faisil and Keough.  They follow the path of
          destruction, growing more and more amazed.  Gib yells to one of
          the porters.

                              GIB
                    The guy on the horse?!

          The porter points at the elevators.


     98   INT. / EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT

          Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel.
          He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him.
          His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button.  If Malik gets
          out at any floor, Harry will have a moment to react and stop.
          Malik can look down and see this.  He knows Harry's got him.
          He just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to
          think.

          The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe.
          The horse flicks her in the face with his tail.


     99   INT. /EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                       *

          The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city.  TRACKING WITH   *
          Malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of  *
          the roof and slides to a stop.  He looks  down twenty stories.

          THE SECOND ELEVATOR  arrives.  The doors part and Harry comes    *
          out, with his Glock poised and ready.  He sees Malik revving     *
          his bike.  The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one-
          eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof.  Amazingly,
          he increases speed, ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE,  ARCING THE
          BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE!

          Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike,
          CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a       *
          LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel!

          Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away.  He
          wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some
          running space.  Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik
          jumped from.  He kicks the horse's flanks and yells HAAHH!!
          The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt
          toward the edge.

          But a horse is not a motorcycle.  It is slightly smarter.  It
          slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly.  Harry
          goes right over its head.  He flies forward, almost going right
          off the roof.  He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling
          over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand.  His Glock
          tumbles down into darkness.

          Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to
          the roof door of the other building.  Getting away.  Harry
          clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard.  He walks over
          to the horse.

                              HARRY
                    What the hell were you thinking?
                    We had the guy and you let him
                    get away.

          He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes.  Pats its neck
          fondly.

                              HARRY
                    What kind of  cop are you?


    100   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half-eaten
          cake and some melted ice cream.  His unopened presents are
          piled at one end of the table.  She raises her head as Harry
          enters sheepishly.

                              HARRY
                    Look, I know you're upset.  I'm
                    really sorry, honey.  I raced
                    home as quick--

                              HELEN
                    It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

          He goes to her and puts his arms around her.  He is tender with
          her.  He wishes he can tell her the truth.

                              HARRY
                    I'm sorry.  Thank you for the
                    party.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  It was great.

          Helen finds a smile for him somewhere.  She really does love
          him, though more and more often lately she finds her heart in
          pain.

                              HELEN
                    Let's go to bed, Harry.  There's
                    only one present you have to open
                    tonight.

          She grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully.


    101   INT. BEDROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Helen walks Harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down.
          She puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie
          back.

                              HELEN
                    Don't move.  I'll be right back.

          She turns on the stereo.  A Kenny G disc she put in there
          earlier.  Soft tenor sax flows around the room.  Helen enters
          the BATHROOM and shuts the door partway.  She opens a cupboard
          and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier.  A
          bottle of champagne on ice.  Two glasses.  Some trashy
          lingerie.

                              HARRY
                    Come on to bed, you don't have to
                    brush your teeth.

                              HELEN
                    I'll just be a second.  So what
                    happened tonight at the office?

                              HARRY
                    I couldn't believe it.  I go back
                    to get this report I need, right,
                    and the phone is ringing, so like
                    a bonehead I answer it--

          Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie.  G-string
          panties and low-cut bra.  She holds up the garter belt, turning
          it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it
          goes.

          ON HARRY, yawning.  Lying with the ease of years of practice.

                              HARRY
                    It's the big client in Japan,
                    and it's the middle of the
                    morning there and their whole
                    system is crashed... this guy's
                    having a meltdown--

                              HELEN
                         (keeping him talking)
                    What'd you do, honey?

                              HARRY
                    Well I pull out the manual on
                    their setup, which is the new 680
                    server...

          Helen is pulling up the black stockings.  She fastens the
          garters to the tops.  Her features are a scowl of
          concentration.  She is very earnest in her preparations.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                    ...and I'm troubleshooting it
                    with them over the phone...
                    talking to a translator, right,
                    who's getting half of it wrong...
                    it was unbelievable...  really
                    wild.

                              HELEN
                         (putting on black
                          pumps)
                    It sounds wild.  So now you're a
                    big hero, right?  For fixing
                    their system.

                              HARRY
                         (faintly)
                    Uh huh.

                              HELEN
                    My husband the hero.

          Red lipstick.  Then she puts a little perfume on her wrists.

                              HELEN
                    I'll be right there, honey.  Just
                    a minute.

          Harry doesn't answer.  Helen puts a little perfume down the
          front of her panties.

                              HELEN
                    Just a second.

          Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne.  Then she slinks
          around the doorframe, making her entrance.  She looks like a
          living 900 number.  Helen stands before the bed, looking down,
          holding the champagne glasses.

          ON HARRY: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly.
          A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth.

          HOLD ON HELEN, all dressed up with no place to go.  She gazes
          down at him, her shoulders slumping.

                              HELEN
                    Happy Birthday, Harry.

          She sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp.

                                                      CUT TO:


    102   EXT. STREET/ NEAR HIGH-SCHOOL - DAY

          It is the following morning.  Harry and Gib are staked out
          watching the front of Dana's school.  Actually, Harry is staked
          out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars.

          Gib just keeps looking at his watch.  He picks up a cellular
          phone and pretends to call the office.

                              GIB
                    Hey, did that guy Harry chased
                    last night call in to give
                    himself up yet?  Cause apparently
                    that's the only way we're going
                    to catch the son of a bitch --

                              HARRY
                         (not listening)
                    Okay.  Here she comes.


    103   EXT. STREET - DAY

          HARRY'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - We see Dana come out to the
          curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike.  She gets on
          behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he
          launches out into traffic.


    104   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

          Harry, who is behind the wheel, pulls out after her.  Trent
          weaves radically through the light traffic, going in between
          the cars.

                              HARRY
                    Look at the way the little punk
                    is driving.  He's all over the
                    place.  Look-- he hasn't
                    signalled once.

                              GIB
                    Goddammit!  That's outrageous.

          Harry speeds up.  Somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay
          with Trent.


    105   EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY

          ON DANA AND TRENT as she looks back and sees Harry following
          her.  She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her

                              DANA
                    Oh my God!  I think that's my
                    dad!

                              TRENT
                    Hang on!

          Trent downshifts and punches it.  The nimble little bike
          screams as it zips between cars.


    106   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

                              HARRY
                         (clenching his jaw)
                    So, you wanna play huh?  You
                    little--

                              GIB
                         (rolling his eyes)
                    That's it.  Get 'im Harry
                         (he draws a pistol)
                    We'll teach that little puke not
                    to signal.


    107   EXT. MOTORCYCLE

          BACK ON TRENT, who's actually a really good rider.  He zig-zags
          through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where
          Gib and Harry get blocked.  He cuts a sharp right turn and
          disappears.


    108   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

          Harry is stuck in stopped traffic.  He pounds the wheel in
          frustration.

                              GIB
                         (exploding with
                          laughter)
                    Ha!  The little prick ditched
                    you!  That is so goddamn funny.

                              HARRY
                    Son of a bitch!

                              GIB
                    Can we go to the office now, Mr.
                    Superspy?

                                                      CUT TO:


    109   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / I.D. ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY

          Harry is sitting at a computer workstation, lit by the monitor
          screen.  Gib and Faisil look on as he clicks through HEADSHOTS
          of known terrorists.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  Harry is very
          focussed.  He stops.  He goes back one.  Studies the face.


    110   INT. ANALYSIS ROOM - TIGHT ON THE SCREEN - DAY

          A defiant looking Syrian with a full beard.

          HARRY holds up his hand, blocking out the beard, concentrating
          on the eyes.

                              HARRY
                    That's him.


    111   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Harry slaps photos down in front of Trilby.

                              HARRY
                    Abu Kaleem Malik.

                              GIB
                         (reading from a file)
                    Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-                     *
                    fundamentalist.  Linked to                             *
                    numerous car-bombings, that cafe                       *
                    bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of
                    Lisbon last year.  Major player.                       *

                              FAISIL                                       *
                    Now he's formed his own splinter
                    faction called CRIMSON JIHAD.

                              GIB                                          *
                    Guess he thought the other
                    terrorist groups were too warm
                    and fuzzy for his taste.

                              FAISIL
                    They call him "The Sand Spider".                       *

                              TRILBY
                    Why?

                              FAISIL
                         (he shrugs)
                    Probably because it sounds scary.                      *

                              TRILBY
                    This is impressive, gentlemen.
                    Of course, it would have been
                    even more impressive if you
                    actually knew where he was.

                              HARRY
                    We'll get him.

                              TRILBY
                    Yes.  You will.
                         (meaning-- you damn
                          well better)
                    Harry, I still want you in
                    charge, even though your cover is
                    blown.  Just keep a low profile.
                         (he slaps a newspaper
                          on the table)
                    I generally prefer it when my
                    covert operations don't make the
                    front page.

          The agents look at the headlines:  WILD WEST CHASE.  Harry and
          Gib wince.


    112   EXT. HELEN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Harry and Gib pull to the curb in front of the building.

                              GIB
                    What's going on?

          Harry gets out of the car and turns back, leaning in the door
          to talk to Gib.

                              HARRY
                    Look, uh... I've got to talk to
                    Helen about this thing with Dana.
                    I'm just going to run in and see
                    if she can get away for lunch.

                              GIB
                    You want me to just hang-- ?

                              HARRY
                    Just hang a minute.

                              GIB
                    I'll just hang then, shall I?


    113   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Harry enters the office of Helen's firm.  He stops at
          reception.

                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Hello Mr. Tasker.  Just a second,
                    I'll  buzz Helen.

                              HARRY
                    No.  No, I'd like to surprise
                    her.  Thanks, I know where her
                    desk is.

          He smiles and breezes past her before she has a chance to
          object.


    114   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

          TRACKING WITH HARRY as he moves through the offices.  He passes
          through a library-like maze of records stacks.  Through them he
          can see Helen at her desk.  But as he approaches, still
          concealed, ALLISON puts a call on hold and whips around to
          Helen.

                              ALLISON
                    Helen!
                         (grinning
                          conspiratorially)
                    It's your mystery man.

                              HELEN
                    Simon?  Ohmygod.

          Helen, normally the image of composure, goes suddenly fluttery
          and nervous as a high-school girl.  She takes the phone,
          turning away from Allison.

                              HELEN
                    Hello, Simon?
                         (pause)
                    It's all right.  There's no one
                    around.

          Helen glimpses Allison with her ears cocked and gives her a
          scowl and a shooing motion.  Allison turns away, grinning.


    115   INT. OFFICE - STACKS OF RECORDS - DAY

          ON HARRY, behind the stacks, reacting.  He silently mouths
          "SIMON?!"


    116   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

                              HELEN
                    You mean right now?
                         (she looks around
                          guiltily)
                    I guess so.  Okay.  I'll be right
                    there.
                         (pause)
                    Yes.  I can't wait.  Bye.

          She hangs up, a little flushed.  Then turns to Allison.

                              HELEN
                    Can you cover me for an hour?

                              ALLISON
                    Just an hour?  You should tell
                    this stud to take more time.

                              HELEN
                    Will you shutup.  I should never
                    have told you about him.

          Helen grabs her purse and rushes out, going right past the
          stack where Harry is standing, dumbfounded.  He looks like he
          was slammed in the stomach with a lead pipe.  His whole like is
          unravelling.


    117   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Gib sees Harry crossing the street, holding his stomach.  He
          seems dazed.  He is not so much walking to the car as wandering
          in its general direction.  He stops, in the street.  Gib gets
          out of the car and rushes to him.  He pulls him out of the path
          of a bus which is HONKING irritably.

                              GIB
                    You look like you got gut-kicked.
                    What's the matter?  You sick?

          Harry leans against the car for support.

                              HARRY
                         (barely audible)
                    He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen.
                    It's Helen, Gib.

                              GIB
                    Something to do with Helen, is
                    what I'm getting.

                              HARRY
                    She's having an affair.

          Harry's best friend in the world brightens with the news.  He
          slaps him on the back.

                              GIB
                    Congratulations.  Welcome to the
                    club.

                              HARRY
                    It can't be.  Not Helen.

                              GIB
                    Nobody believes it can happen to
                    them.

                              HARRY
                    It can't be.

                              GIB
                    Same thing happened to me with
                    wife two.  I had no idea until I
                    came home and the house was
                    empty.  I mean empty.  She even
                    took the ice-cube trays from the
                    fridge.  What kind of person
                    would think of that?

                              HARRY
                         (not listening)
                    I still don't believe it.

                              GIB
                    Relax.  Helen still loves you.
                    She just wants this guy to bang
                    her.  It's nothing serious.
                    You'll get used to it after a --

          Harry wheels around on Gib, grabbing him by the lapels, and
          slams him against the car.

                              HARRY
                    STOP.  CHEERING.  ME.  UP.

          We see in Harry's rage, frustration, and hurt confusion a
          vulnerability we never expected to see.

                              GIB
                    What'dya expect Harry?  She's a
                    flesh and blood woman.  And
                    you're never there.  It was only
                    a matter of time.

          Harry sags.  His friend is right.  Gib opens the car door and
          helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time--

                              GIB
                    I say we concentrate on work.
                    That's how I always got through
                    it whenever my life turned to
                    dogshit.  Let's catch some
                    terrorists and then you can beat
                    the crap out of them.  You'll
                    feel better.

          Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry.

                              GIB
                    Women.  Can't live with 'em.
                    Can't kill 'em.


    118   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          Harry and Gib are in the LISTENING ROOM.  Banks of tape-decks
          recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and
          collating transcripts.

                              GIB
                    He's giving us a blank check on                        *
                    wiretaps.  So I've set 'em up on
                    all of Juno's shipping agents,
                    her clients, and Faisil made up                        *
                    a list of possible contacts that
                    Crimson Jihad might have in this
                    country.  Now all we can do is                         *
                    wait --                                                *

          He notices Harry is not listening.

                              GIB
                    Is this national security stuff
                    boring you?

                              HARRY
                    Put a tap on her phone.

                              GIB
                    What're you talking about?  We
                    have that.

                              HARRY
                    Helen's phone.  Her office line
                    and the line at my house.

          Gib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously.
          He pulls him into an empty office.

                              GIB                                          *
                         (a whispered hiss)                                *
                    Okay .  .  .I have two words to                        *
                    describe that idea.  In.  Sane.
                    Unauthorized wiretap is a felony,
                    pard.

          Harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth
          clenched.

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, and we do it twenty times
                    a day.  Don't give me that crap.
                    Just put on the taps.  Now.

                              GIB
                    Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

          Harry releases him and turns away.  Gib straightens his jacket,
          looking at his friend like he's completely losing it.


    119   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          That night Harry is actually there on time for dinner.  He
          glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily.  She looks at
          her peas.

                              HARRY
                    How was school today?

                              DANA
                    Fine.

          Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her.  Silence.  Helen
          glances at him.

                              HELEN
                    So.  You came by to see me today?

          She is a too casual, masking her nervousness.

                              HARRY
                    I was in the area, and I thought
                    you might like to have lunch.

                              HELEN
                    They must've just missed me.

                              HARRY
                    They said you had to run out.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They
                    needed some documents down at the
                    court house.  I barely made it.

          Harry watches her lying to him with some amazement.  You can
          see the jaw muscles clenching.

                              HARRY
                    So, a little excitement in an
                    otherwise dull day.  Did is work
                    out okay?

                              HELEN
                    Oh, sure.  Fine.
                         (she gets up suddenly)
                    I'll get some more gravy.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

          Dana bolts.  She has eaten about four bites.  Harry sits at the
          table, alone.  He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is
          lying to everybody else.  He is a man without a center, lost.

                                                      CUT TO:


    120   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          TRACKING ALONG THE BANK OF RECORDERS.  Harry comes to a
          particular set of machines.  He reaches past the technician and
          picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts.

          ON HARRY walking and leafing through the phone transcripts.
          Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head
          slowly.  Harry freezes, staring at the page and WE HEAR THE
          SOUND OF THE CONVERSATION OVERLAID:

                              HELEN
                    Hello?

                              SIMON
                    Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe
                    to talk?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.  Go ahead.


    121   INT. CAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - DAY

          A man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car SOMEPLACE (DAY),
          speaks into a cellular phone.  This is SIMON.  He is dark
          haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way.  He is
          unshaven and his clothes look slept in.  He glances around in
          a furtive manner.

                              SIMON
                    I can't talk long.  Can you meet
                    me for lunch tomorrow?  I must
                    see you.


    122   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

          NOW WE SEE HELEN, at her office.

                              HELEN
                    Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?

                              SIMON
                    The same place.  One o'clock.  I
                    have to go now.  See you
                    tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.


    123   INT. LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          The last line is played ON HARRY, reading.  Now he is seeing
          the proof in black and white.  He slowly crumples the paper in
          one hand, his expression dark.


    124   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen is reading in bed.  She glances up as Harry comes into
          the room.  Gives  him a quick smile.  Too quick.

                              HARRY
                    I thought we might have lunch
                    tomorrow.

                              HELEN
                    I can't, honey.  I promised
                    Allison I'd go shopping with her.
                    Sorry.

          Harry watches her smoothly lying to him.  It's surreal to him.

                              HARRY
                    No problem.

          He surreptitiously picks up Helen's purse from a dresser and     *

          THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and Harry comes out, walking Gizmo on a     *
          leash.  Harry walks briskly along the sidewalk, jerking the
          poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go.         *


    127   EXT. SIDEWALK, BY GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          He reaches Gib's car, half a block up, and hands him Helen's     *
          purse.  Gib eyes the dog warily.  He growls at it.  Gizmo hides  *
          behind Harry's legs.

                              GIB
                    Look, Harry.  I know this is
                    rough.  I felt the same way the
                    first time it happened to--

          Harry holds up one finger.  His eyes and expression are so
          intense, Gib just soft of trails off.

                              GIB                                          *

    130   INT. / EXT. HELEN'S CAR - DAY

          TIGHT ON THE PURSE sitting on the seat next to her as Helen
          drives through the city.


    131   INT. / EXT. N.D. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry drives while Gib watches--


    132   INT. SEDAN, CLOSE UP ON MAP - DAY

          A COMPUTERIZED MAP below the dash.  Helen's purse appears as a
          moving blip on a street-map of the city.


    133   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - DAY

                              GIB
                    Okay, she's turning on
                    Seventeenth.  Make a left, you
                    should see her.

          Harry makes the turn.

                              HARRY
                    There she is.


    134   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          Up ahead they see Helen's RED ACCORD pulling into a parking low
          next to a CAFE.  Harry parks the car a block away and gets out
          his binoculars.


    135   EXT. HELEN'S CAR THROUGH BINOCULARS - DAY

          HARRY'S POV through the scope.  Helen gets out of her car and
          looks around as she walks to the cafe.  It is not a nervous
          look, but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed.
          She goes inside.


    136   INT. SEDAN - DAY

                              HARRY
                    Give me audio.

          Gib hits a switch and they hear the clamor of the cafe at lunch
          rush come over a speaker.


    137   INT. CAFE - DAY

          The restaurant is nothing fancy.  A little dark.  Helen makes
          her way to a booth in the back.  Sitting in the shadows, facing
          the door, is SIMON.  She sits down opposite him.  He doesn't
          smile or kiss her in greeting, but glances around the room like
          he expects a threat to leap out at any moment.

                              SIMON
                    Are you sure you weren't
                    followed?

                              HELEN
                    I kept looking back, like you
                    taught me.  I didn't see anyone.

                              SIMON
                    Okay.  It's just, things are a
                    bit hot for me right now.  If I
                    get a signal...
                         (holds up a cigarette
                          lighter meaningfully)
                    I may have to leave suddenly.

                              HELEN
                    I understand.

                              SIMON
                    It's my job to risk my life, but
                    not yours.  I feel bad about
                    bringing you into this, but
                    you're the only one I can trust.

          Simon creates an atmosphere of danger.  His haggardness give
          him an air of mystery and desperation.

                              HELEN
                    Where were you?  On a... uh,                           *
                    mission?

                              SIMON
                    Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert                            *
                    operation.  And this one got a
                    little rough.

                              HELEN
                    Worse than Cairo?                                      *

                              SIMON
                    Cairo was a day at the beach next                      *
                    to this.

          Harry and Gib turn to each other, shocked with the dawning
          awareness.

                              GIB
                    Guy's a spook!

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, but for who?                                     *

                              GIB
                    He could be working her to get to
                    you.

          Harry waves his hand, silencing Gib.

          INTERCUT FROM HERE ON BETWEEN HARRY/GIB AND HELEN/SIMON.


    139   INT. CAFE - DAY

          SIMON puts a newspaper on the table, sliding it over to Helen.

                              SIMON
                    Did you read the papers
                    yesterday?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.

                              SIMON
                    Sometimes a story is a mask for
                    a covert operation.  See-- two
                    men killed in a restroom, and two
                    unidentified men in a running                          *
                    shootout, ending at the                                *
                    Marriot...


    140   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          HARRY AND GIB react, realizing that it is the story of their
          operation gone awry.


    141   INT. CAFE - DAY

                              HELEN
                    That was you?!

                              SIMON
                    You recognized my style.  See,
                    you're very good.  You're a
                    natural at this.


    142   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry starts to get it.  Then is dawns on Gib.

                              GIB
                    The guy's a fake!  He's taking
                    credit for our moves.


    143   INT. CAFE - DAY

          HELEN LEANS CLOSE TO SIMON.  She clearly is hanging on his
          every word.

                              HELEN
                    Tell me what happened?

                              SIMON
                    I'm sorry, I can't.

                              HELEN
                    You can trust me completely.

                              SIMON
                    I know.  But it would compromise
                    your safety too much to know
                    certain things.

                              HELEN
                    Right, of course.  I was worried
                    when I didn't hear from you that
                    night.

                              SIMON
                    It's strange.  I knew I was in a
                    woman's thoughts when I was
                    shooting it out with those
                    assassins.


    144   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          HARRY REACTS to the outrageous fabrication.

                              GIB
                    Unbelievable.


    145   INT. CAFE - DAY

          BUT HELEN is eating it up.

                              HELEN
                    Were they trying to kill you?                          *

                              SIMON

                    talking about.  Two won't bother                       *
                    me again.

                              HELEN
                    And you chased one?

                              SIMON
                    Something came over me, I just
                    had nail him, no matter what the                       *
                    risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I
                    thought he had me, a couple of                         *
                    times.  But I really can't take
                    credit .  .  .

                    You can't?                                             *

                    No.  It's the training.  It                            *
                    shapes you into a lethal                               *

                    Not here.  I'll call you and
                    we'll rendezvous again.
                         (he looks around)
                    We have to leave separately, so
                    we aren't seen together.  For
                    your safety.

                              HELEN
                    You'll call me then?

                              SIMON
                    Yes.  Now go.

    156   EXT. STREET/CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon is cruising in the Corvette with the radio blasting.
          Thinking he is supercool.


    157   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place.  A
          hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be
          classics.

          Simon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line.  He
          reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing
          the SALE PRICE of the car.  He sticks it back on the dash.  The
          car doesn't even belong to him!


    158   EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAR LOT - DAY

          Harry and Gib pull up.  They watch as Simon jumps out of the
          Vette and goes into the sales office.

                              GIB
                         (laughing)
                    He's a goddamn used car salesman.
                    This just gets better.
                         (catching himself)
                    Sorry Harry, I know this is
                    painful.

          Harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the
          street.


    159   INT. CAR LOT SALES OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)                 *

          TIGHT ON A TAPE PLAYER, with Simon's hand adjusting the volume.
          The sound of traffic noise and middle-eastern music blares from
          the deck.

          PULL BACK to see Simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over
          the din of a real place.

                              SIMON
                    It's a great little bar, Amanda,
                    you'd love it.  Beirut's a great
                    place if you know the city.                            *
                    Listen, this isn't a secure line.
                    I'll tell you all about it when
                    I get back tomorrow... if I live.
                         (pause)
                    Scared?  Never!  Except of you--

          During this, the owner of the place, DOUG WURTZ, has come out
          of the back room and looked out at the lot.  What Doug sees is--

          HARRY, browsing among the cars.

          DOUG turns from the window and bears down on Simon, who sees
          him coming and speeds up his rap.

                              SIMON
                    --I have to go, baby.  A guy's
                    coming toward me--

          Doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the
          cradle.

                              DOUG                                         *
                    Simon, look out there.  You see
                    that man?  Notice how he's
                    looking at the cars.  He's called
                    a customer.  I know it's been a
                    while, but do you remember what
                    you're supposed to do when we
                    have a customer?


    160   EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even
          reached him.

                              SIMON
                    It wants you too.  Feel it
                    vibrate?  How about a little
                    spin?

          Simon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs
          around the car.  He leaps over the closed door into the
          driver's seat and starts the car.

                              SIMON
                    You gotta jump in.  That's rule
                    number one.  It takes a little
                    practice, but there's no way
                    around it.


    161   EXT. STREET - DAY

          Simon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back.

                              SIMON
                    See, it's not just the car, it's
                    a total image.  An identity you
                    have to go for.  This isn't some
                    high-tech sports car...  it
                    doesn't even handle that great.
                    But that's not the idea, is it.

          Simon gives Harry a big grin.  Harry returns a knowing chuckle.
          Ha ha.

                              SIMON
                    What're we talking about here?
                    Pussy, right?

                              HARRY
                    Absolutely.

          Simon laughs.  Harry laughs.  A big lusty, male-bonding kind of
          laugh.

                              SIMON
                    Well then this is a vital piece
                    of equipment.  Used properly, it
                    can change your life.  See, you
                    cruise.  No racing.  This ain't
                    a Ferrari.  You check out the
                    scenery, let the scenery check
                    you out.  You got to take it
                    slow.  Old cars are like good
                    women... they heat up fast.

          How do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold?  Ask Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Keep talking.

                                                      CUT TO:


    162   EXT. TACO STAND - DAY

          Simon is holding court.  Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his
          greatest area of expertise.  We see Harry laughing, going along
          with the guy.  Pretending to bond.

                              SIMON
                    Let's face it, Harry, the Vette
                    gets 'em wet.  But it's not
                    enough.  If you want to really
                    close escrow, you gotta have an
                    angle.

                              HARRY
                    And you've got one.

                              SIMON
                    It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm
                    not that much to look at.  No
                    really.  I can be honest.  But I
                    got 'em lining up, and not just
                    skanks, either.  Some are.

                              HARRY
                    So what's your angle?

                              SIMON
                    Sorry.  Trade secret.

                              HARRY
                         (grinning)
                    Sure.  Set me up and then don't
                    tell me.

          Simon leans forward, conspiratorially.

                              SIMON
                    Okay, just ask yourself.  What do
                    women really want?  You take
                    these bored housewives, married
                    to the same guy for years.  Stuck
                    in a rut.  They need some
                    release.  The promise of
                    adventure.  A hint of danger.  I
                    create that for them.

                              HARRY
                    So you're basically lying your
                    ass off the whole time?  I
                    couldn't do it.

                              SIMON
                    Well, think of it as playing a
                    role.  It's fantasy.  You have to
                    work on their dreams.  Get them
                    out of their daily suburban grind
                    for a few hours.

                              HARRY
                    Isn't that hard to keep up, in
                    the long run?

                              SIMON
                    Doesn't matter.  I like change.
                    You know, constant turnover.  As
                    soon as I close the deal, it's
                    one of two more times, then
                    adios.

                              HARRY
                    Use 'em and lose 'em.

                              SIMON
                    Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta
                    pick your target.  They have to
                    be nice little housewife types.
                    School-teachers.  But, I'm
                    telling you, you get their pilot
                    lit, these babes, they can suck-
                    start a leaf-blower.

                              HARRY
                    What about the husbands?

                              SIMON
                    Dickless.  If they took care of                        *
                    business, I'd be out of business,
                    know what I mean?

                              HARRY
                    Those idiots.


    163   EXT. STREET/ VETTE - DAY

          They are cruising along, with Harry driving this time.

                              HARRY
                    You working on someone right now?

                              SIMON
                    I always have a couple on the
                    hook.  You know.  There's one
                    right now, I've got her panting
                    like a dog.  It's great.

          Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter.

                              HARRY
                    What does she do?

                              SIMON
                    Some kinda legal secretary of
                    something.  Married to some
                    boring jerk.

          Harry takes a corner too fast.  The tires squealing.

                              SIMON
                    And she could be so hot, if she
                    wanted to be.  She's like a dying
                    plant that just needs a little
                    water.

          When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging...  they
          laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake-
          eyed.  He could kill Simon with one punch.  He's visualizing
          his wife getting porked by this guy.

                              HARRY
                    But with you, she gets to be hot,
                    right?

                              SIMON
                    Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

          They laugh together.  Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle.
          He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel.  Now for the big
          question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY?

                              HARRY
                    Sooooo... she's pretty good in
                    bed, then?

                              SIMON
                         (yelling suddenly)
                    Hey, slow down you're gonna miss
                    the turn!


    164   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

          Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty.  He cranks the
          wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a
          smoking bootlegger-180.  It screeches backward, sliding right
          into its parking space perfectly.

          Simon is bugeyed.  But he is non-plussed for only about two
          seconds.  Then he's back to selling.  He scrambles out and goes
          around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke.

                              SIMON
                    See.  You and this car were meant
                    for each other.  Why fight it?
                    Sure, I have a couple other
                    buyers lined up, but I like your
                    style.  Whattya say?  Should we
                    start on the paperwork?

                              HARRY
                    Let me think about it.  Hold it
                    a day for me?

          Simon grins and winks.

                              SIMON
                    Because it's you.


    165   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dana is in the living room, watching TV when she sees her
          mother cross through, dressed to go out.

                              HELEN
                    Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell
                    your father I may be late.

                              DANA
                    Where are you going?

                              HELEN
                    Out.

          Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles.


    166   INT. ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

          ON HELEN, checking herself in the hall mirror.  She looks at
          her big dowdy purse.  Hating it suddenly.  She pulls her
          pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet
          for a small handbag, then charges out.

    167   OMITTED


    168   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry is driving.  Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his
          briefcase and hands them to him.

                              GIB
                    Here's today's transcripts.
                    There's nothing interesting.

                              SIMON
                    Nothing from Simon?

          Keeping one eye on the road, Harry riffles through the sheets.
          He glances at the top of the last couple of sheets.  He scowls.
          Then SUDDENLY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.  The car dives to the curb,
          bumping one wheel.  Harry gets out and charges around to Gib's
          side.  Gib gets out, his expression blank.

                              HARRY
                    Give me the page.

                              GIB
                    What are you talking about?

                              HARRY
                    It skips from page nine to
                    eleven.  Where's page ten?

                              GIB
                    Aw, it's gotta be a typo--

                              HARRY
                    GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!

          Harry hammers his fist against the car-window right next to
          Gib.  It explodes inward in a shower of glass.

                              GIB
                         (shrugging)
                    Okay.  Here.

          He fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket.  Harry
          grabs it from him, straightening it.

                              GIB
                    Jeez, Harry.  Seek help.

          As Harry begins to read, we go into FLASHBACK.


    169   INT. USED CAR LOT OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK

          ON SIMON - He is talking into the phone in hushed, urgent
          tones.

                              SIMON
                    Helen.  I need your help.  Can
                    you meet me tonight?

          INTERCUT WITH HELEN at her office.


    170   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK/INTERCUT

                              HELEN
                    What's happened?

                              SIMON
                    It's serious.  That's all I can                        *
                    say.  Just meet on K Street under                      *

                    Shit!  It's almost eight.                              *

          He jumps back in the car and activates the GPS locator.
          Helen's purse-blip flashes on the grid map.

                              HARRY
                    She's still at my house.                               *

                              GIB
                    The purse is still at the house.


    172   INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry growls and slams the car into gear, roaring out into
          traffic.  Horns honk as he cuts off people.  He is oblivious.
          He grabs his rover.

                              HARRY

                              HARRY
                    Immediate roll.  Acquire subject
                    at K Street and Key Bridge.                            *
                    Vehicle is red-and-white                               *
                    convertible.  You have six

                    Roger, One.  Rolling.

                              UNIT TWO
                    Copy that.

                              GIB
                    Wait a minute!  Are you out of
                    your mind?  You can't pull agents
                    off a priority surveillance to
                    follow  your wife!    It's gross
                    misappropriation of Sector's
                    resources, it's...  it's a breach
                    of national security.

          Harry drives on, ignoring him.  Gib grabs his shoulder, shaking
          him.

                              GIB                                          *
                    You copy, Harry?  This is too
                    far.  You're losing it big-time.
                    I have to stop you.

                              HARRY
                    Whatya going to do?   Tell?

                              GIB
                    Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our
                    butts.  So your life is in the
                    toilet.  So your wife is banging
                    a used car salesman.  Sure it's
                    humiliating.  But be a man here--

                              HARRY
                    You tell on me, I tell on you.

                              GIB
                    Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a
                    preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean
                    as a --

                              HARRY
                    What about that time you trashed
                    a six-week operation because you
                    were busy getting a blow-job?

                              GIB
                         (instantly contrite)
                    You know about that?

          Harry turns to him.  His glare could melt metal.  Gib gives a
          fatalistic shrug.

                              GIB
                    Take Franklin, it's quicker.

          Harry makes the turn, squealing tires.

                              GIB
                    You don't have any pictures
                    though, do ya.  Huh?                                   *


    173   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Helen pulls  her car under the bridge.  She checks her watch.
          Helen notices that her hand is shaking.  She looks around and    *
          the place seems deserted.  She is about to leave when she sees
          headlights flash briefly in the shadows.

          A red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up
          next to her.  Simon motions for her to get in quickly.


    174   EXT. PARKING LOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS - NIGHT

          LONGSHOT  on Simon and Helen in the Vette, coming out of the
          parking low under the bridge.  We are watching them through a
          sophisticated telephoto night-vision device.


    175   INT. UNIT TWO SEDAN - NIGHT

          Agent MORTON lowers the SCOPE and picks up his rover.  He puts   *
          the car in gear to follow.

                              MORTON
                    Two here.  Subject is southbound
                    on Key Bridge.  A man and a woman                      *
                    in the vehicle.

                              HARRY (RADIO)
                    Roger's two.


   175A   INT./EXT. SIMON'S CAR

          Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors.

                              SIMON
                    Now don't be alarmed... but if
                    I'm spotter, it would be best if
                    they don't see you.  You should
                    keep your head down until we're
                    out of the city.

          He pushes her head down onto his lap.  She crouches there, with
          her cheek against his thigh.  He's cruising along, loving it.


    176   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is trying to watch the computerized city map on the screen,
          but Harry keeps cornering so fast he loses his place.

                              MORTON (RADIO)
                    The woman has her head in the
                    guy's lap.

          Harry is doing a jaw-clenched slow burn.

                              HARRY
                    Roger, two.  One to Condor, do
                    you have visual?

    184   EXT. HIGHWAY LEAVING CITY - NIGHT

          It is a highway heading away from the city.  IN A LONG LENS
          SHOT, the Vette appears over the brow of a hill.  A moment
          later A HELICOPTER rises up behind them, A DRAMATIC REVEAL.  It
          follows the Vette.

                              CONDOR (VOICE OVER/RADIO)
                    This is Condor.  We have the
                    ball, repeat... we have a good
                    lock-up on I.R.

          CUT TO: INFRARED VIEW of the Vette, from the helicopter's FLIR
          system.  The greenish, image-intensified view of the car is
          like daylight.

       as they head out into the country.

       EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT                                      188

       The headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide
       mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the
       highway.  Simon and Helen get out of the car.

                            SIMON
                 My place in the city is too
                 hot right now.  So is the
                 penthouse in New York.  But
                 this place is secure.

       He takes her inside.

       INT. SIMON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                   190

       Helen feels awkward in the small, junky space.  A tape deck
       is playing cool jazz.  Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine.
       He clinks her glass with his.

                           SIMON
                 To our assignment.

                           HELEN
                 What is it you need me to do?

                              SIMON
                    Helen, I want you to be my wife.

                              HELEN
                    I'm married!

                              SIMON
                         (quickly)
                    Just for the operation in Paris.
                    I need to be married.  They'll be
                    looking for a man traveling
                    alone.

                              HELEN
                    We're going to Paris?

                              SIMON
                    Helen, there's a double agent in
                    my outfit... I don't know who.
                    There's no one I can trust.
                    Except you.  Can you get away?
                    Just for two days.

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I have to think...

                              SIMON
                    Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.

          He clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and
          magazines out of the way.  She sits down and he tops off her
          glass from the wine bottle.


    191   EXT. BILLBOARD AND TRAILER PARK - NIGHT

          The agents have gathered behind a billboard.  Harry, Gib and     *
          the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits.  They
          finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-       *
          masks.  They don them in perfect unison.  Commando precision.
          Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard,
          closing in on Simon's trailer.


    192   INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Helen looks up at Simon and nods slowly.

                              HELEN
                    Okay.  I'll do it.

          Simon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand.

                              SIMON
                    You are incredibly brave.  I have
                    to remind myself the fear you
                    must be feeling.  I've lived like
                    this for years, so I'm used to
                    it.  Every day when I get up, I
                    think it might be my last.  But
                    it makes you appreciate life.
                    And the moment.  Because that may
                    be all you have.

          He moves a little closer.  Casting his spell.

                              SIMON
                    To pull this cover story off, we
                    have to look exactly like two
                    people who are intimate with each
                    other.  The enemy can spot a fake
                    easily.

          He puts his hand on her knee.  She tenses up instantly.

                              SIMON
                    You see what I mean?  That
                    reaction would give us away in a
                    second.  Try to relax.

                              HELEN
                    It's just that... it's been
                    sixteen years since anyone but
                    Harry did that, I--

                              SIMON
                    Relax.  There, that's better.
                    Let yourself slip into the role.

          He puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly
          into a kiss.  This doesn't seem real to Helen.  She finds
          herself not pulling away.  He lowers her slowly until they are
          lying together on the bed.

                              SIMON
                    There you go.  That's right...

          He slides his hand up her thigh.  The fingers, stroking in
          little circles, slips under her skirt.  And--

          She suddenly EXPLODES, pushing on his chest, forcing him up off
          her.

                              HELEN
                    NO!  Stop!
                         (he keeps kissing her)
                    Get off me RIGHT NOW!

          Simon struggles with her.  She gets one knee up under him and
          levers him up.  She pushes him to a standing position.  She
          sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt.

          He looks forlorn and pathetic.  Now he's going to try
          pleading...

                              SIMON
                    If not for me, do it for
                    democracy.


    193   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          KABOOM!!  The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny
          shaped-charges.  The concussion throws Simon forward on top of
          her.  Five BLACK-SUITED FIGURES swarm in, carrying machine
          pistols and flashlights.


    194   INT. TRAILER - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT

          Lit by the beam of the flashlight, he sees Simon on top of
          Helen, her knees up on either side of his hips.  It looks bad.
          Simon and Helen sit up... stunned.  They look like two rabbits
          in the headlights of a truck.  She screams.


    195   INT. TRAILER - ON SIMON - NIGHT

          Reacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly
          materialized as a nightmarish reality.  He is stunned.
          Blinking, mouth hanging open.


    196   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - SIMON'S POV - NIGHT

          WHAT SIMON SEES -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the XENON
          LIGHT from a helicopter.  Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor-
          wash.  The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both.
          Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up.
          Harry yanks Simon to his feet.


    197   EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Gib comes out first with Helen.  She struggles like a wildcat,
          frankly surprising the hell out of Harry.  Simon is brought
          out, dazed and compliant.  Helen whips around, KNEEING GIB
          right in the balls.  Gib OOPHS and doubles over, and Helen runs
          for it.

          Harry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen.
          She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her.  He
          grabs her and gets her in a headlock.  She bites the hell out
          of his arm.  Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs
          up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon.
          Standard operating procedure.  Which is why he can't understand
          why Harry punches him, knocking him down.

          Harry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other
          agents and going RRRRR-RRRR to make his point (since he can't
          talk without her recognizing his voice).  They head for the
          cars.

                                                      CUT TO:


    198   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM/OBSERVATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

          An empty room with a single stool under a light, and a large
          two-way mirror.  The door opens and Helen is escorted in by
          Keough, still wearing his jumpsuit.  Helen has a black hood
          over her head.  Keough undoes a pair of handcuffs, freeing her,
          then leaves quickly.

          Helen whips the hood off and blinks in the light.  She wheels
          at the sound of the door locking and runs to it.  Pulls twice
          on the handle, without effect.  She crosses to the mirror and
          peers at her reflection, trying to see if anyone is there on
          the other side.


    199   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS is a dark chamber.  We see Helen
          perfectly, peering in, though she sees nothing.  Harry and Gib,
          in silhouette, sit at a console.  Harry speaks into a
          microphone.

                              HARRY
                    Sit down.


    200   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON HELEN'S SIDE of the mirror we hear Harry's voice shifted by
          a DIGITAL PROCESSOR.  It is a cold booming mechanical voice.
          Harsh and inhuman.

                              VOICE (HARRY)
                    I said SIT DOWN.
                         (she does)
                    Who do you work for?

                              HELEN
                    Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath.
                    I'm a legal secretary.

                              VOICE (HARRY)
                    Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And
                    what were you going with the
                    international terrorist, Carlos
                    the Jackal?  Taking dictation?

                              HELEN
                    He said he was an American agent.


    201   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE CONTROL room we can see Harry, Gib and, through the
          glass, Helen.  Their voices sound normal on this side.

                              HARRY
                    How long have you been a member
                    of his faction?

                              HELEN
                    I don't know anything about a
                    faction.  I just met Simon...  or
                    whatever his name is...  a couple
                    of weeks ago.  I barely know him.

                              GIB
                    That's not what it looked like
                    when we found you.

          Harry scowls at Gib in the dark.  Helen flushes, remembering.

                              HARRY
                    How did you meet him?

          FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:


    202   INT. MALL - DAY/FLASHBACK

          We see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works,
          having a cappucino and a croissant.

                              HELEN (V.O.)
                    About two weeks ago I was at the
                    mall, having coffee...

          Simon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her.  He
          approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat
          next to her.  His manner is furtive.  He keeps looking around,
          as if for hidden assasins.  He hands her a briefcase.

                              SIMON
                         (speaking very low)
                    Keep this for me.  I can't afford
                    to be taken with it.  National
                    security is at stake.  I'll
                    contact you if a can.  Okay?  Oh--

          He seems to suddenly spot something OFF CAMERA and dashes off
          the other way.


    203   EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY/FLASHBACK

          Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the
          briefcase.  She keeps looking over her shoulder.


    204   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK

          She has the briefcase on her desk while she works.  She keeps
          glancing at it as she types.  Finally she hunches over it and
          starts picking the locks with a paper clip.

          TIGHT ON SECOND LOCK, popping open.

          ON HELEN as she opens the case.  She gasps.

          INSIDE THE CASE are the following items:  A tiny camera, some
          loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look
          like gibberish which must be ENCRYPTED, some street maps of
          Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther P.P.K.  PISTOL.  Helen,
          eyes wide, closes the case.


    205   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT

          Helen shrugs, finishing up her story.

                              HELEN
                    I should have gone to the police,
                    I suppose.

                              GIB
                    But you didn't.  Why not?

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I guess... I
                    wanted to see what would happen.

                              HARRY
                    What did happen?

                              HELEN
                    Three days later, he called me.
                    He told me to meet him at
                    Overlook Park.


    206   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - SUNSET/FLASHBACK

          Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to
          Georgetown and Embassy Row.  Helen is sitting on a park bench
          when Simon shows up, sitting beside her.  She hands him the
          briefcase.

                              SIMON
                    Thank you.  You saved my life.
                    What's your name?

                              HELEN
                    Helen.

                              SIMON
                    You can call me Simon.
                         (he touches her hand)
                    You're very brave to do this...
                         (then notices the locks
                          have been opened)
                    You opened it.

                              HELEN
                    I just glances inside.


    207   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - CLOSE UP ON SIMON

          CLOSE ON SIMON, looking right into her eyes.

                              SIMON
                         (solemn)
                    Then you know.


    208   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT

          Harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole
          thing.

                              HARRY
                    Why did you continue to see him?

                              HELEN
                    He needed my help.

                              HARRY
                    Not because you were attracted to
                    him?

                              HELEN
                    No.

                              HARRY
                    You weren't attracted to him at
                    all?

                              HELEN
                    Well, maybe a little.

                              GIB
                    Is this a common thing for you?
                    Cheating?

                              HELEN
                    No!  Never!

                              GIB
                    So, it was your first time.

                              HELEN
                    I wasn't cheating!

                              HARRY
                    Tell me about your husband, Mrs
                    Tasker.

                              HELEN
                    Harry?  What can I say about
                    Harry?  He's a sales rep for a
                    computer company.

                              HARRY
                         (hard question for him)
                    Would you say he was boring,
                    then?

                              HELEN
                         (she sighs, nodding
                          fatalistically)
                    Yeah.  I suppose he is.

                              GIB
                    So sex with him isn't exactly
                    making your flag wave anymore.

          Harry cuffs him on the shoulder.  Signals with a scowl for him
          to stay out of it.  Gib smirks.  Harry's put him through enough
          shit the last couple of days, it's time for a couple digs.

                              HELEN
                    That's none of your goddamn
                    business!  What kind of questions
                    are these?

                              HARRY
                    You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs.
                    Tasker, so I suggest you
                    cooperate.  If we want to know
                    the most intimate details of your
                    life, you'd better tell us.

          Helen glowers at the mirror.  Her hands are shaking and she
          hates it that they can probably see she is afraid.

                              HELEN
                    My husband is a good man.

                              GIB
                    But he's not exactly ringing your
                    bell lately, right?  I mean--

          Harry covers the mike and whips around on Gib.

                              HARRY
                    Let me handle this part.  Do you
                    mind?
                         (to Helen)
                    Why did you go to Carlos'
                    hideout?

                              HELEN
                    He wanted me to go with him on a
                    mission, to pose as him wife.

                              HARRY
                    And you agreed?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.

                              HARRY
                         (amazed)
                    Why?

          Helen searches herself for the explanation.

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I guess I needed
                    something...

                              HARRY
                    What did you need?

                              HELEN
                    I needed to feel alive.  I wanted
                    to do something...  outrageous.
                    And... I don't know... it felt
                    good to be needed.  To be
                    trusted.  To be special.

          In verbalizing it she just feels smaller, more pathetic that
          she ever did.  She hates the unseen voices for making for try
          to explain her deepest, unvoiced needs.

                              HELEN
                    There's so much I wanted to do in
                    this life, and it's like I
                    haven't done any of it.  And the
                    sand's running out of the
                    hourglass.  I want to be able to
                    look back and say:  See!  I did
                    that.  It was wild and it was
                    reckless and outrageous and I
                    fucking did it!
                         (she glares at the
                          mirror)
                    And I frankly don't give a shit
                    if you understand this or not.

          Gib looks at Harry, eyebrows raised.  Whew!  Harry is studying
          his wife like she's some fantastic new species.

                              HARRY
                    This Simon.  Did you sleep with
                    him?

                              HELEN
                    No.

                              GIB
                         (covering the mike)
                    She's lying.

                              HARRY
                    You didn't have sexual relations
                    with him?

                              HELEN
                         (acidly)
                    Look, if you ask me everything
                    twice, this is going to take a
                    really long time.  And I have to
                    get home to my family.

                              GIB
                    You're not going anywhere.

          Helen loses it.  It is fury and fear, tears and rage all at
          once--

                              HELEN
                    Let me out of her!  Right now!

                              HARRY
                    Answer the question--

          She picks up her stool and charges toward the mirror, swinging
          it with all her might.  It bounces off harmlessly.

                              HELEN
                         (she swings again,
                          yelling)
                    I didn't sleep with him!
                         (and again--WHAM!)
                    You hear me, you chickenshit
                    bastards--

          WHAM!  She hits the mirror again.

                              GIB (INHUMAN VOICE)
                    Everyone tries.  It's
                    unbreakable.

          WHAM!  WHAM!  WHAM!  The mirror suddenly stars from side to
          side with huge cracks.  She's about to beat her way through it.


    209   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM Harry and Gib jump back.

                              GIB
                    She could be telling the truth.

                              HARRY
                         (to Helen)
                    Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.
                    There is only one more question.

          Helen drops the stool.  She stands there panting.  Her fury
          spent, she begins to cry.

                              HELEN
                    What?

                              HARRY
                    Do you still love your husband?

                              HELEN
                         (softly)
                    Yes.

                              HARRY
                    Louder please.

                              HELEN
                    I love him.  I have always loved
                    him and I will always love him.
                         (she wipes at her eyes)
                    Can I go home, please?


    210   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM Harry states at her.  He smiles.

                              GIB
                    Now what?

                              HARRY
                         (leaning forward to the
                          mike)
                    There is only one solution to
                    your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You
                    must work for us.

                              GIB
                         (whispering to Harry)
                    Oh shit.  Harry... what're you
                    doing?

                              HARRY
                         (like: isn't it
                          obvious?)
                    I'm giving her an assignment.
                         (to Helen)
                    I am offerring you a choice.  If
                    you work for us we will drop the
                    charges and you can go back to
                    your normal life.  If not, you
                    will go to federal prison, and
                    your husband and daughter will be
                    left humiliated and alone.  Your
                    like will be destroyed.

                              HELEN
                    Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--

                              HARRY
                    Yes or no.

                              HELEN
                    What do you think?  Of course
                    yes!  What's involved?

                              HARRY
                    You will be contacted with the
                    assignment.

                              HELEN
                    My husband can't know about this.

                              HARRY
                    No one must know!  Especially
                    him.  You must appear to live
                    your life normally, conveying
                    nothing.  The security of this
                    nation depends on it.  Can you do
                    that?

                              HELEN
                    I think so.

                              HARRY
                    Think carefully.  You will be
                    lying to the man you love.  The
                    person who trusts you the most.

                              HELEN
                         (fearless)
                    I can do it!

                              HARRY
                    The code name of your contact
                    will be Boris.  Your code name
                    will be--

                              HELEN
                         (excited)
                    Natasha?

                              HARRY
                    No.  Doris.


    211   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON HELEN, not liking her wimpy code-name.


    212   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the
          bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord.  The door slides
          open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands.  She is
          wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands.
          She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed
          off.  She watches it drive off into the night.


    213   EXT. ROCK QUARRY - NIGHT

          The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry.  The door
          opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his
          black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask.  Gib follows as Harry
          guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop.  Harry whips off the
          hood and Simon takes in his surroundings.

                              SIMON
                    Yeeaoowww!!

                              HARRY
                    You son of a bitch.  Did you
                    really think you could elude us
                    forever, Carlos?

                              SIMON
                    Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My
                    name's Simon.  Look, just let me
                    go.  There's no need to kill me.
                    I haven't seen your--

          Harry whips off his ski-mask.

                              SIMON
                    -- face.  Shit!  Shit!!

          Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry.  Then it
          dawns...  He looks up, brightening hopefully.

                              SIMON
                    It's you!  Hey, you still
                    interested in that Vette at all?

                              GIB
                    You can drop it now, Carlos.  The
                    game is over.  Your career as an
                    inter-national terrorist is too
                    well documented.

                              SIMON
                    No... I sell cars.  That's all!
                    Not even foreign cars.  Nothing
                    international, I swear.  I'm no
                    terrorist.  Everything I said was
                    a lie... you have to believe me.
                    I'm actually a complete coward.
                    If I ever even saw a gun I'd--

          Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the
          muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes.

                              SIMON
                    -- faint.  Aahhh!  Don't kill me.
                    I'm not a spy.  I'm nothing.  I'm
                    navel lint.  I have to lie to
                    women to get laid.  And I don't
                    score much.  It's pathetic.
                         (he looks down)
                    See, look... would a spy pee
                    himself?

          Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling.  He pulls Simon
          away from the edge, then gestures with his gun.

                              HARRY
                    Beat it.

                              SIMON
                    No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot
                    me.

          Harry starts back to the truck.  Simon stays right with him,
          facing him, terrified to turn away.  Like a dog following him.

                              SIMON
                    Please don't.  You can have the
                    car for free--

                              GIB
                    Take off, dipshit!

          Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks
          THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance
          backward.  The two agents get into the van and tear off in a
          cloud of dust.  Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles
          from nowhere.

                                                      CUT TO:


    214   INT./ EXT. SEDAN - DAY

          TIGHT ON LOCATOR SCREEN as a blip moves across the grid of city
          streets.  Gib drives while Harry watches the screen.

                              HARRY
                    We should pick up visual at the
                    next light.

          The scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings.  He picks it
          up.

                              HARRY
                    Morning, boss.


    215   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - DAY

          INTERCUT WITH SEDAN.  Spencer Trilby stands glowering as he
          talks to Harry.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry, this report on last
                    night's operation is the thinnest
                    piece of crap I've ever seen from
                    you.  I'm sure you won't mind
                    giving me a little more detail on
                    why all these assets were
                    deployed.


    216   INT./EXT. SEDAN - DAY

                              HARRY
                    Absolutely.  But can it wait?
                    I'm on a critical surveillance
                    right now.

          Harry spots something up ahead.  He snaps his fingers and
          points, then whips a pair of gyro-stabilized binoculars to his
          eyes.

          HARRY'S POV THROUGH SCOPE:  Trent, on the Yamaha with Dana on
          the back, rides through the intersection up ahead.  Dana bops
          to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips
          between cars.  Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a
          distance.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry.  Is there anything you
                    want to tell me?

                              HARRY
                         (innocently)
                    No.  Not that I can think of.

          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ominously on Spencer Trilby.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry?  You know we never fire
                    anybody.

          Click.  Harry hangs up the phone slowly.

                              GIB
                    We're dead, right?  So...
                    where'd you put the transmitter?

                              HARRY
                    In her Walkman.  It's the one
                    thing I knew she'd be taking.


    217   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          Harry walks toward the closed warehouse doors, past Trent's
          parked Yamaha.  We hear MUSIC from inside.


    218   INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE, we see what it is that Dana has been
          doing when she skips school.  A garage band of teenagers,
          mostly older than her, are playing loudly.  Dana has the
          microphone, belting out a punchy cover of the old Cream classic
          "Sunshine of Your Love".  The guitar parts have been industrial-
          ized, and it actually sounds pretty hip.

          Harry watches from the shadows, standing behind a pillar not
          far from the stage.  Watching his daughter gyrating in the
          spotlight.  His reaction is hard to read.


    219   INT. WAREHOUSE - CLOSE UP OF CIRCUIT-BREAKER - DAY

          TIGHT ON THE MASTER CIRCUIT-BREAKER as Harry's hand throws the
          switch.


    220   INT. WAREHOUSE - STAGE - DAY

          The stage is plunged into darkness and the music stops
          abruptly.  Before the band members can react, they hear the big
          metal doors rolling and sunlight blazes in.  Dana stares into
          the glare, seeing an ominous silhouette standing there.  The
          shadowy figure walks toward them.

                              FIGURE
                    You! Come with me.

          The figure comes straight toward Dana.  To her horror is turns
          out to be her dad.  Her heart stops.

                              DANA
                    Oh my Gooooood.


    221   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          Harry appears through the doors, marching Dana by the arm.  He
          walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with
          weeds, and sits her down for a talk.

          She is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in
          front of her friends.

                              HARRY
                    There are going to be some
                    changes Dana.  You're going to
                    start following some rules.  And
                    I'm going to be there to see that
                    you do.

                              DANA
                    Yeah, right.

                              HARRY
                    You're going to stay in school.
                    Do you understand?

                              DANA
                    Why?  So I can wind up like you?
                    What's the point?

          You think Harry's going to really rain on her parade.  But he
          doesn't.  He becomes very tender.  He pushes the hair back from
          her face.

                              HARRY
                    Did I tell you about the time we
                    first met?

          She looks up at him, puzzled?

                              HARRY
                    You were quite young at the time.
                    All wet and still attached to
                    your mom by a cord.  You opened
                    your eyes and looked right at me.
                    And I knew then I would always
                    love you with all my heart.

          Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness.  This is
          not just some chump that she has to put up with.  This is her
          father.  He is a part of her.  No matter what happens they are
          in this thing together.  Tears start to run down her cheeks.

                              HARRY
                    Somewhere along the way I got
                    lost, honey.  I forgot about what
                    was really important.  I'm sorry
                    pump-- I mean--

          She grabs his in a fierce hug.  Harry closes his eyes, letting
          the moment purify him.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, regarding this singing--

          She pulls back, suddenly wary.  Oh shit.

                              HARRY
                         (grinning)
                    You were pretty good.


    222   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - DAY

          Dana sits wedged into the front seat between Gib and Harry.
          Father and daughter are singing raucously loud, with the
          windows down.

                              HARRY/ DANA
                    I've been waiting so long To be
                    where I'm going In the sunshine
                    of your looooove

          They crack up after the long sustain.  They are both suffused
          with a glow of rediscovery.  Harry pulls the car to the curb in
          front of Dana's school.

                              DANA
                    Dad, how come you know the words?

                              HARRY
                    Honey that song came out in 1968,
                    when I was exactly your age.

                              DANA
                    Unbelievable!  Trent told me he
                    wrote it.  He's history.


    223   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          The image of a family dinner.  Helen is avoiding Harry's eyes.
          Harry looks over at Dana and she gives him a tiny smile.  Then
          she rises from her half-finished dinner and heads out of the
          kitchen.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

                              HELEN
                    Where are you off to young lady?

                              DANA
                         (pointing toward her
                          room)
                    I have a book report.

          Helen watches her go.  That's strange.

                              HARRY
                    So last night was pretty
                    exciting, huh?

                              HELEN
                         (alarmed)
                    What?
                         (then smoothly--)
                    Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I
                    thought the damn towtruck was
                    never going to get there.

          Harry smiles, reaching for more chicken.  The phone RINGS.
          Helen controls the urge to run to it.

                              HELEN
                    Hello?

                              METALLIC VOICE
                    Doris?

                              HELEN
                    Oh.  Yes?


    224   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - NIGHT

          GIB, AT OMEGA SECTOR, uses the SPEECH SYNTHESIZER to disguise
          his voice.

                              GIB
                    Listen carefully.  Go to the
                    Hotel Marquis in one hour.  Pick
                    up an envelope marked Doris at
                    the front desk.  And dress sexy.


    225   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          BACK ON HELEN as she reacts to that.

                              HELEN
                    What?

                              VOICE
                    Get going!
                         (CLICK)

                              HELEN
                         (thinking for a second,
                          then--)
                    Uh... well, okay then.  You sound
                    terrible.  I'll run out right
                    now.  Just call the prescription
                    in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no
                    problem.  Bye.

          Harry smirks, listening to her lie.  She's good.  The smirk
          drops as she turns.

                              HELEN
                    Allison is sick in bed.  I have
                    to go over there, honey.

                              HARRY
                    Sure, hon.

          She walks unhurriedly out of the room.  Behind her back, Harry
          is grinning.  The second Helen is out of his sight line, she
          runs up the stairs.  Harry waits a moment then picks up the
          phone.


    226   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ ELECTRONIC LAB -- NIGHT

          Gib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated
          to DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING.  The phone in his briefcase rings.
          Gib answers.

                              GIB
                    You've reached a new low with
                    this one.  I can't believe you're
                    crazy enough to use the room at
                    the Marquis.

                              HARRY
                    Why not?  You think I can afford
                    a suite like that on my salary?
                    Is Jean-Claude done yet?                               *

          Gib looks over at a SOUND RECORDING BOOTH nearby.  In it a FAT   *
          FRENCH AGENT, JEAN-CLAUDE is doing voice recording from a hand-  *
          written page.

                              GIB
                    Not quite.


    227   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - INSIDE THE BOOTH - NIGHT

          We hear Jean-Claude record a line on a tiny DAT tape recorder.   *
          He speaks with a cosmopolitan French accent.  Close your eyes    *
          and he's Charles Boyer.

                              JEAN-CLAUDE                                  *
                    No no.  Do it slowly.  Very
                    slowly.


    228   OMITTED                                                          *


    229   INT. HOTEL MARQUIS - NIGHT

          A big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby.  Helen
          enters, looking different than we have ever seen her.  She has
          been commanded to be sexy, and she is.  Her black slinky dress
          is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been
          aware of.  She's pulled her hair back and added pearls.  Now
          she looks elegant and hot.  Playing the role.


    230   INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

          She goes to the front desk and signals the ASSISTANT MANAGER
          with her eyes.  He comes over to her.

                              HELEN
                    Do you have an envelope for
                    Doris?

          The man nods.  Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and
          hands her the envelope.  She opens it as she walks across the
          lobby.  In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a
          phone number.


    231   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON A PAY PHONE as Helen finishes dialing the number.  She
          scans the lobby as the phone rings--

                              METALLIC VOICE
                    Listen.  You are a prostitute
                    named Michelle.  Go to the room.
                    A man will be there.  He is a
                    suspected arms dealer.

                              HELEN
                    Do I have to... you know-- ?

                              VOICE
                    No.  He has particular tastes.
                    He likes to watch.  You will say
                    his regular girl, Carla, is sick.
                    If he likes you, he will tell you
                    what to do.  You must plant the
                    bug near the telephone, by the
                    bed, before you leave.  If you do
                    not accomplish your mission, the
                    deal is off.


    232   INT. HOTEL/ TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

          Helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward
          the suite.  She stops by a mirror and checks her look.  Decides
          she is too uptown.  She pulls the neckline of her dress down so
          it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem.  Ditches the
          pearls.  Puts on some red lipstick.

          Now she doesn't look hot and elegant... just hot.  She
          practices a slinky walk, getting into the role.

          Suddenly she remembers her wedding ring.  She pulls on it.  It
          probably hasn't been off in years.  She licks her finger and     *
          twists it off.  Yoww!  She puts it on her right hand and turns   *
          the modest diamond palm-side in .  .  .  Out of site.  Then,     *
          reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and
          unlocks the door.


    233   INT. SUITE - NIGHT

          Helen comes in hesitantly.  The lights are off.  The suite is
          large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the
          city.  It is the room Harry was using, posing as Renquist.  A
          FRENCH-ACCENTED VOICE comes from the next room.

                              VOICE
                    In here.

          She goes into the bedroom.  There is a dark figure sitting in
          a chair, just a silhouette.

                              MAN
                    Step into the light.

          It is a corner room.  The drapes on one side are closed,
          shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in
          a slash of moonlight.  She steps forward into it.

          TIGHT CLOSE UP on the figure.  We can just make out that it is
          Harry, though Helen cannot.  TILT DOWN to show his hand, out of
          sight behind the chair-arm, as he manipulates the pause button
          on the DAT tape deck.

                              HELEN
                    I'm Michelle.  Carla's sick.  She
                    thought you might like me, so --

          Harry goes SSSSHHHH.  Silencing her gently.  He silently clicks
          off the PAUSE button.  The DAT recorder plays.  Charles Boyer,
          deep and hypnotic, speaks from Harry's outline.  Harry
          lipsynchs.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Let me do the talking.  You are                        *
                    very pretty.  You may start by                         *
                    unzipping your dress.

          PAUSE button.  She starts to yank the zipper down.               *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    No no.  Do it slowly.  Very
                    slowly.

          Helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down           *
          languorously, revealing her creamy back.  She is not wearing a   *
          bra.                                                             *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now slip the dress down...                             *
                    slowly.

          Helen is starting to get into the ritual.  She lets the dress    *
          slip off her shoulders.  It slides down her body to the floor.   *
          She steps out of it, still in high heels.                        *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now slide the nylons off one by
                    one.

                              HELEN
                         (puzzled)
                    I'm not wearing any.

          Harry winces.  He starts the next line immediately.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    That's good.  Now the panties.                         *

          The ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be
          tastefully done).  She conceals the bugging device in her hand
          as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone.  Helen is
          still concentrating on her mission.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now turn, cheri, in the
                    moonlight.  Let your body flow
                    like water.

          She turns.  Her skin is beautiful in the silvery light.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now dance for me.  Go on.

          Helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well.
          The scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her
          raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic
          combination.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Let your hands be a lover's hands
                    on your own skin as you move.
                    Yes, that's it.

          TIGHT ON Harry's eyes as he studies her.  His game, meant to
          give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on
          mightily.  He is amazed to see her playing the role, getting
          into it.  This is not the Helen is thought he knew for sixteen
          years.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now, lie on the bed and close
                    your eyes.

          She does.  Harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Keep them closed.  Do not open
                    them.

          He sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her.  He
          strokes her hair, lovingly.  Then runs his fingertips over her
          eyes, down her cheeks.  To her it feels delicate and delicious.
          Part of her is enjoying this a lot.  But Helen is torn between
          wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so
          far is enough to cause her to abort her mission.

                              HELEN
                    I thought you only liked to
                    watch.

          Harry goes SSSHHH.  It's all he can do.  He bends over her and
          brings his lips slowly down to her.  He touches them to hers so
          slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her.  Then he takes
          her in a passionate kiss.

          And she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and SMASHES IT OVER
          HIS HEAD.  Harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and
          semiconscious.

          Helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to
          dress rapidly.  She still doesn't recognize Harry, who is face
          down.  He groans and starts to rise.  She kicks him in the ribs
          and finishes putting her dress on.  She sticks the bug under
          the night table and grabs her shoes.  Mission accomplished,
          motherfuckers.

          Harry grabs her ankle.  She raises one shoe to kosh him again,
          and sees who it is.  Freezeframe.  Total shock.  She can't even
          form the question.

                              HELEN
                    Harry-- ?!


    234   INT. SUITE DOOR - NIGHT

          CRASH!!  The door lock is shattered by tremendous force and
          THREE MEN burst into the room.  We may recognize them as
          workers from Juno's shop.  They are wielding pistols and are
          clearly part of Malik's terrorist brigade.

          Harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything
          with Helen there, and risk her getting shot.  He acquiesces as
          they pull him to his feet.

                              HELEN
                    He's got nothing to do with this.
                    It's me you want, right?

                              HARRY
                         (to lead TERRORIST)
                    Let the hooker go.  She's not
                    important.

                              HELEN
                    Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle
                    this.

                              LEAD TERRORIST
                    Shutup, both of you.

          During this exchange, the thugs have handcuffed Harry's hands
          behind his back.  The leader gestures to one of the men to
          bring Helen along.  Helen and Harry are dragged roughly out of
          the room with pistol-muzzles stuck in their ribs.


    235   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

          The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle
          Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs.

                              HELEN
                    Listen, you don't need him, he's
                    nothing.  He's a sales rep for a
                    computer company, really--

          The thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up.

                              HELEN
                    That was unnecessary.


    236   INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT                                      *

          A stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen   *
          through the basement labyrinth.                                  *

                              HELEN
                    What were you doing there?

                              HARRY
                    You wouldn't believe me.

          A pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear.

                              TERRORIST LEADER
                    Talk again, I kill you.

          They are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting   *
          with the door open.  A fourth terrorist slides the van door      *
          shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel.  The van    *
          takes off.

                                                      CUT TO:              *

    237   OMITTED                                                          *


    238   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a
          private hanger.  The van doors open and the hostages are
          brought out.  Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind
          the van.  The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to
          open the passenger door.  A slender pair of ankles emerge,
          followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly
          beautiful but now quite sinister.

          To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the
          limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed
          to kill, approaching them.

                              JUNO
                         (with a wry smile)
                    Hello, Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Juno.  I wish I could say it's a
                    pleasure to see you again.

                              HELEN
                    You know her?

          Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the
          prisoners toward the plane.

                              JUNO
                    Who's your little friend?

                              HELEN
                    I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my
                    husband.  And you are?

                              JUNO
                         (to Harry)
                    So now it's Tasker?  Not
                    Renquist?


    239   INT. G-3 JET - NIGHT

          They enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane.  Helen
          has never seen anything like this.

                              HELEN
                    Look, Harry's not part of this.
                    He's just a sales rep.

                              JUNO
                    No, my dear, he is a federal
                    agent.  He killed two of my
                    colleagues the other night.

                              HELEN
                    No, you don't understand, we've
                    been married for 15 years--

                              HARRY
                    Look, Juno, this is just some
                    whacko hooker I met in the bar.

          AKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats
          and strap them in.

                              HELEN
                    Harry, what's the matter with
                    you?  Tell them the truth.  We're
                    married, we have a daughter--

                              HARRY
                         (looking at Helen
                          contemptuously)
                    I don't know what this crazy
                    bitch is on.  You should just cut
                    her loose, so we can get down to
                    business.

                              HELEN
                    Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where
                    did I get this?

          Helen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck,
          and opens it to show Juno.

          THE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together, smiling.

          Harry roles his eyes.  Great, Helen.  A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up
          carrying a tray.  Juno smiles graciously at Helen.

                              JUNO
                    Something before take-off?

          The hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps
          Helen in the shoulder.

                              HELEN
                    Oooowww!!  That hurt.  You biii--

          She slumps.  Juno looks at Harry.

                              JUNO
                    She was telling the truth, wasn't
                    she Harry?  She really doesn't
                    know.  Interesting.

          Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry.  He slides into
          unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM.


    240   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          The G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south.


    241   EXT. PIER - NIGHT

          A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier.  Next to
          the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building,
          two stories high.  There are floodlights on the dock but beyond
          is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms.
          It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island
          in the Caribbean.

          There is a lot of activity.  Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by
          the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles.  About thirty
          men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various
          activities.  Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles.

          MALIK is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp-
          covered object about 15 feet high from the ship.  A rusting
          gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse.  Malik looks up as
          an AEROSPATIALE HELICOPTER thunders toward them over the black
          Caribbean water.

          The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door.
          The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a
          groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft.  They are covered
          by hoods.

          Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off.  Harry takes
          in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik.
          Lethal energy flows between them.

                              MALIK
                    Who is this woman?

                              JUNO
                    His wife.

                              MALIK
                         (seeing the
                          possibilities)
                    His wife?  Good.  Bring them.


    242   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Malik leads the entourage into the warehouse, where brilliant
          floodlights illuminate--

          THREE HUGE STONE FIGURES, lined up in the middle of the space.
          The tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded,
          revealing a FOURTH STATUE.  The figures are cracked and
          obscured by centuries, but they are unmistakably warriors
          mounted on horseback.  The legs and arms are missing on some,
          but the massive heads and necks remain.

                              JUNO
                    Incredible, aren't they?  Warrior
                    figures from the Persian Empire
                    of Darius the First, around 500
                    BC.  I call them "The Four
                    Horsemen".

          She approaches the nearest figure, caressing its flank.  A man
          with a jackhammer steps up to her.

                              JUNO
                    They're absolutely priceless.

          She shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer.  He blasts
          right into the body of one of the Horseman, destroying it.
          Stone fragments fall away, revealing a cavity cut with great
          precision inside the figure.

          Inside is a BRIGHT METAL CONTAINER.  Four terrorists pull it
          out and set it on the ground.  It is six feet long and coffin-
          like.  Malik steps up to it, his eyes glistening.  A hush has
          fallen over the group.

                              MALIK
                    Open it.

          The latches are released and the lid lifted.  Inside is
          machined metal object, roughly conical, about five feet long.
          Malik signals to Harry to step closer and look.

                              MALIK
                    Do you know what this is?

                              HARRY
                    Can you give me a clue?  It could
                    be a water heater for all I know.

          Malik grabs Helen, jerking her roughly forward.  He whips out
          a knife and inserts the point under Helen's jaw, forcing her
          head back and drawing blood.

                              MALIK
                    Do you know why you have been
                    brought here?

                              HELEN
                    N-no.

                              MALIK
                    So that this man can verify to
                    the world that Crimson Jihad is
                    now a nuclear power.

                              HELEN
                    How can Harry do that?  He's a
                    salesman for chrissakes.

                              MALIK
                    If we were wrong about him...
                    then the last thing you see will
                    be your blood spraying in his
                    face.

          Harry steps forward, his face grim.

                              HARRY
                    This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from
                    an SS-22N launch vehicle.  The
                    warhead contains 14.5 kilos of
                    enriched uranium, with a
                    plutonium trigger.  The nominal
                    yield is 10 kilotons.
                         (in Arabic, subtitled)                            *
                    Release her and I'll cooperate.

          Malik lowers the knife from her jaw.  He turns away from her
          like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to
          remove the other weapons.  Jackhammers tear into the stone
          figures.

          Helen is just staring at Harry, her mouth open.  He turns to
          her, not knowing what to say.  He shrugs sheepishly.

                              HARRY
                    What can I say?  I'm a spy.

          She just looks at him for a long time.  She moves closer,
          staring and staring, letting it sink in.  Then she hauls off
          and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him
          down.

                              HELEN
                    You bastard!!  You lying son of
                    a bitch!!

          Terrorists grabs her and restrain her.  She starts to cry.

                              HARRY
                    I'm sorry, honey.

                              HELEN
                    Don't call me honey!  You don't
                    ever get to call me honey again.
                    You understand?!  You pig!

          Juno looks at them both and laughs.  She offers Helen a tissue.

                              JUNO
                    Here you go, dear.

          NEARBY, Akbar is going through the contents of Helen's handbag
          and Harry's wallet.  He rips open the bottom stitching and
          pulls out the geo-positioning transmitter.

                              AKBAR
                    Abu!  Look at this!                                    *

          Malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor.
          Helen looks at the crushed transmitter.  She stares at Harry
          with dawning realization.

                              HELEN
                    You bugged me?!!

          Juno cracks up at this.


    243   INT. CITATION JET - NIGHT

          The jet has become a mobile tactical-command center, with Gib,   *
          Faisil, and several other agents working out of portable         *
          equipment cases.  Faisil looks up from a computer screen         *
          suddenly.

                              FAISIL                                       *

          Gib goes up to the cockpit.  They are on approach and the
          lights of Miami fill the front window.

    244   INT. WAREHOUSE - NO NAME KEY - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON BLACK AND WHITE VIEWFINDER IMAGE of the terrorists'
          handycam.  Harry is speaking directly into the camera,
          finishing up his message.

                              HARRY
                    ...and I can verify that they
                    have the arming box and all                            *
                    equipment necessary to detonate
                    the four warheads.  This is
                    absolutely the real thing,
                    gentlemen.

          The camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest
          of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs.

                              MALIK
                    You have killed our women and                          *
                    children, bombed our cities from
                    afar like cowards, and dare to
                    call us terrorists--

          Over the image of Malik, a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash.

          CUT TO SCENE, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by
          one of his men.  The CAMERAMAN is sweating, wondering if he
          should interrupt.  He gulps nervously as Malik drones on.

                              MALIK
                    -- But now the Oppressed have                          *
                    been given a mighty sword, to                          *

                    forces out of the Persian Gulf
                    area, immediately and forever,
                    Crimson Jihad will rain fire on
                    one major US city each week until
                    these demands are met...

          BACK TO VIEWFINDER IMAGE.  BATTERY warning flashing faster.

                              MALIK
                    ... First one weapon will be
                    detonated on this uninhabited
                    island as a demonstration of

                    willingness to be humanitarian.
                    However, if there demands are not--

          In a burst of static the image GOES BLACK.

          The cameraman nervously lowers the camera, ashen faced.
          Malik's eyes are black with murder.

                              CAMERAMAN
                    Battery, Abu.

                              MALIK
                    Get another one, you moron!


    245   INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

          A filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse).
          A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no
          glass in the windows.  Harry and Helen are brought in by two
          TERRORIST GUARDS.  Juno follows then into the bleak room.
          Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs.

          A MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase.  He has skull-
          like features.  He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view
          of the contents:  medical instruments, needle-probes, drills,
          Dremel tools with saw blades.

                              JUNO
                    This is Samir.  See if you can
                    guess his specialty.

                              HARRY
                    Oral hygiene?

                              JUNO
                    Not exactly.

                              HELEN
                         (scared)
                    What's going on, Harry?

                              JUNO
                    Samir is just going to ask Harry
                    a few questions.  See, we're not
                    even sure which agency Harry
                    works for.  Now, Samir is
                    absolutely first class, but on
                    the other hand we have Harry,
                    here, who has managed to lie
                    convincingly to the woman he
                    loves for 15 years.  So it will
                    be interesting to see how long he
                    can resist.

                              SAMIR
                         (holding up a syringe)
                    This will help.

          Samir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe.

                              HARRY
                    You know, you should swab that
                    with alcohol.  I might get an
                    infection.

                              SAMIR                                        *
                    I'll return when this has taken                        *
                    effect.  Then we'll talk.                              *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    I'm looking forward to it.                             *

          Samir exits.                                                     *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Why are you helping these raving
                    psychotics.

                              JUNO
                    Because they're very well-funded
                    raving psychotics, and I'm
                    getting a lot of money.

          She kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg.

                              JUNO
                    You think I care about their                           *
                    cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.                         *
                    See, America is on top now .  .                        *
                    .  but so was Rome, once.  All                         *
                    civilizations crumble.  One
                    nation succeeding over another.
                    What does it mean in the long
                    run?  The only important thing is
                    to live well.  And...  living                          *
                    well takes money.                                      *

                              HARRY
                    You're damaged goods, lady.

          Harry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred.  The drugs
          are taking effect.

                              JUNO
                         (indicating Helen)
                    Did you tell her about us, Harry?

                              HARRY
                    There is no us, you psychotic
                    bitch.

                              JUNO
                    Sure.  Say that now.

          Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately.  She
          breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect.  Helen is
          trembling with rage.

                              JUNO
                    Thanks for everything, Harry.  It
                    was good while it lasted.

          Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his
          belt.  Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees.
          She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the
          grenade then pulls the pin.

                              JUNO
                    Now just keep your knees
                    together, and you'll be fine.

                              HELEN
                    Something you obviously have a
                    hard time doing!

                              JUNO
                    Hold that thought.

          Juno leaves.  Harry looks dopily at Helen.

                              HARRY
                    There was nothing.  I swear.

          Helen doesn't believe him, and why should she.  She looks up     *
          from staring at the grenade, to see that Harry's head has
          slumped forward.

                              HELEN
                    What did he give you?

                              HARRY
                         (groggy)
                    Sodium amytal, maybe some other
                    truth agent.

                              HELEN
                    It makes you tell the truth?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              HELEN
                    Is it working yet?

                              HARRY
                    Ask me a question I would
                    normally lie to.

                              HELEN
                    Are we going to die?

                              HARRY
                    Yup.                                                   *

                              HELEN                                        *
                    I'd say it's working.

                              HARRY                                        *
                    They'll either torture us to
                    death, shoot us in the head, or
                    leave us until the bomb goes off.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    Okay, okay.  I get it.  How long                       *
                    have you been a spy, Harry?

                              HARRY
                    17 years.

                              HELEN
                    My God.  Have you had to...  have
                    sex with other women in the line
                    of duty?

                              HARRY
                    I don't take those assignments.

                              HELEN
                    What about Juno?

                              HARRY
                    She's really a fox, isn't she?

                              HELEN
                    Did you pork her Harry?

                              HARRY
                    No.
                         (pause)
                    But I wanted to.

                              HELEN
                         (crying)
                    Are you a total lying,
                    scumsucking pig Harry?

                              HARRY
                    Looks that way.


    246   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          ON MALIK as he pokes through Harry and Helen's stuff on the
          table.  He picks up Helen's wallet and opens it.  ECU WALLET -
          a picture of Harry, Helen and Dana.  Malik stares at it a
          moment.  Then motions to one of his men.


    267   INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

          Samir lifts Harry's head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced.

                              SAMIR
                    Is there anything you would like
                    to tell me before we start?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.  I'm going to kill you
                    pretty soon.

                              SAMIR
                         (calmly preparing his
                          instruments)
                    I see.  How exactly?

                              SAMIR
                    Well, I thought I'd break your
                    neck, then use you as a human
                    shield, then kill the guard with
                    that knife there on your table
                    and take his gun.

          Samir approaches Harry with a long steel needle probe.

                              SAMIR
                         (humoring Harry)
                    And what makes you think you can
                    do all that?

                              HARRY
                    Because I picked the lock on
                    these handcuffs...

          He holds them up to show Samir.  Then he explodes out of the
          chair-- Breaks the torturer's neck-- Spins him between himself
          and the guard-- Who then hesitates to fire-- Giving Harry the
          split second he needs to grab the knife from the table and
          throw it into the guard's eye, killing him instantly.

          Helen is flat blown away.  Wow.  It only took a few seconds for
          Harry to reverse the situation.  Her Harry!  He picks up the
          guard's 9mm pistol and staggers over to her.

                              HARRY
                    Don't move.

          He kneels down in front of her.  Gently he slips his hands
          between her thighs, getting a grip on the grenade, then sliding
          his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely.

          He stops moving, suddenly.  She realizes with a sudden jolt of
          terror that he has frozen.

                              HELEN
                    What is it?

                              HARRY
                         (staring transfixed)
                    God, you have great legs.

                              HELEN
                    Harry... snap out of it!

          She sees how shitfaced he is.  He holds the grenade up, gripped
          safely so the spoon can't fly off.

                              HARRY
                    Go it, baby.


    248   EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

          Harry and Helen emerge from the building, creeping through the
          shadows.  She stops him for a second.  Gets very close to him,
          whispering, crouched in the shadows.

                              HELEN
                    Tell me something before this
                    stuff wears off and you start
                    lying again.

                              HARRY
                    What?

                              HELEN
                    Do you still love me?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              HELEN
                    As much as you used to?

                              HARRY
                    No.
                         (she deflates)
                    Much more.

          She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth.

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (grinning)                                        *
                    It wore off.

          At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block
          building.

                              HARRY
                    They found the bodies.  Come on--


    249   EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

          Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of
          the mangrove swamp.  A LIGHT HITS THEM.  TWO TERRORISTS,
          running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry
          and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.  The trunks explode     *
          with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.               *

          As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  *
          the shadows and grabs one from behind.  He wrests his rifle      *
          away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.  The      *
          first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry
          grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner.
          Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two-
          hand neck-breaker-- SNAP.

          Two more run around the corner of a building.  Harry stomps his  *
          foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.  It    *
          flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .  .     *
          .  and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.  Helen comes   *
          out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.  His shirt is
          ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   *
          expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.             *

                              HELEN
                    I married Rambo.                                       *

          He grabs her and kisses her passionately.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.

    254   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          LOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four
          horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the
          floorspace.  A rental truck is being loaded with conventional
          weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED
          STINGER MISSILES.  One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit
          cut in the concrete floor.  Malik and most of the terrorists
          are gathered around it.

          A GUARD, F.G.  on the catwalk, watches intently from the
          railing.  So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on
          him.  SNAP.  Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol
          before it can hit the floor.  He and Helen crouch behind a
          steel pillar, watching the proceedings below.  Helen keeps
          glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment
          before by her husband.  It is all surreal.

          BELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language.  He pulls a
          chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY.
          Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's
          arming computer.  Harry is listening intently, translating for
          Helen.

                              HARRY
                    In ninety minutes a pillar of                          *
                    holy fire will rise at this place                      *
                    as a sign to out enemies.                              *
                         (Malik theatrically
                          turns the arming key)
                    It is done...

          Malik jumps out of the pit.  He signals and terrorists pour
          concrete into the pit, covering the bomb.  He begins ranting
          again.

                              HARRY
                    Now no man can stop us.  We are
                    set on our course.  No force can
                    stop us...
                         (as libbing)
                    ... we're cool, we're badass,
                    blah blah.


    255   INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT

          Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans.
          The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns
          in the air.  Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all
          over the inside of the metal building.

          Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work
          at double time.  They are loading warheads Two and Three onto
          trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being
          wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside.


    256   INT. WAREHOUSE - ON CATWALK - NIGHT

                              HELEN
                    If we're on an island, why are
                    they using trucks?

                              HARRY
                    We must be in the Florida Keys .                       *
                    .  .  the Overseas Highway                             *
                    connects the islands to the
                    mainland.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    So there's no border, no customs.                      *
                    They can just drive anywhere they                      *
                    want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       *
                    stop them .  .  .

                              HARRY
                    Just us.

                              HELEN
                    What are you going to do?

                              HARRY
                         (shrugs, like: what do
                          you think?)
                    Go down there and kill everybody,
                    I guess.

          He hands her the MAC-10.  She holds it clumsily.

                              HELEN
                    Oh shit.

                              HARRY
                    Wait here.  If you have to use
                    this, use it.  Don't choke.
                    Okay?

          She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the
          floor below.


    257   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

          ON HARRY, reaching the floor.  He slips behind some packing
          crates.  Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard
          as he can, down to the other end of the building.  KABOOM!!  He
          uses the distraction to move forward.  But it goes wrong almost
          right away...  A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him,
          shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips
          on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides
          under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him,
          with guns raised.

                              HARRY
                         (to Helen)
                    SHOOT!!


    258   INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT

          HELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one!
          But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the
          gun

          FLIES OUT OF HER HANDS.
          It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off.  B-B-BLAM!
          The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10
          cartwheels and hits further down.  ANOTHER BURST.  Another
          terrorist is splattered.

          It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST
          MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!!

          She has inadvertently saved her husband.  Harry looks up from
          behind cover-- to see all seven dead.  Now it's his turn to be
          amazed.  He signals to her to run... get off the exposed
          catwalk.  She makes it through the door to the outside stairs
          as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her.


    259   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

          A TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry.  Harry
          snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the
          guy's chest.  Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen
          terrorists and opens fire.  Malik shouts to the drivers of the
          trucks to get going.  The other terrorists return fire at Harry--
          Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where
          he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But
          terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and
          rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door--


    260   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          --landing outside.  He takes cover behind an aircraft REFUELING
          TRUCK.  Not a good place.  He is pinned down by automatic
          weapons fire.  He looks around for Helen, who is--


    261   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A FORKLIFT - NIGHT

          50 yards away.  She is unarmed and unable to help.


    262   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A REFUELING TRUCK - NIGHT

          HARRY cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the
          nozzle of the hose.  He opens the flow and-- A stream of JET-
          FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right
          across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he
          has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach.

          Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area,
          setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists.


    263   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik
          a LAW rocket.  Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to
          fire.


    264   EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

          Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as--
          MALIK fires.  The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry
          leaps toward the dark water as-- KABOOOM!  Behind him the gas
          truck EXPLODES IN A HUGE FIREBALL.


    265   EXT. UNDERWATER - OFF THE DOCK - NIGHT

          ANGLE LOOKING UP, UNDERWATER, AS HARRY HITS THE WATER AND
          dives down.  An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the
          surface above him.  Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the
          inferno above him so he can surface.


    266   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON HELEN, watching the burning wreckage of the gas truck.

                              HELEN
                    Oh my God.  Harry.

          A PISTOL ENTERS FRAME.  Its muzzle taps the back of her head.
          She gasps and turns to see-- JUNO, holding the weapon expertly.

                              JUNO
                    My condolences to the window.                          *

          Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet.  Helen SLAPS JUNO      *
          HARD.  Juno has a slash across her cheek.  Blood trickles down.  *
          She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the        *
          wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side.  Her   *
          face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face,   *
          preparing to kill her .  .  .                                    *

          And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her.                  *

                              MALIK                                        *
                    Not now.  We may need a hostage.                       *

          Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the     *
          limo nearby.                                                     *

                              JUNO
                    Let's go, Suzy Homemaker.


    267   EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

          Harry is still swimming.  He reaches the edge of the fire and
          surfaces, gasping for breath.  Treading water he scans the
          dock.


    268   EXT. WATER OF THE DOCK - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT

          Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun
          point toward a LIMO.


    269   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          TRACKING WITH JUNO, approaching the car.  Malik passes, jumping  *
          into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men.  The fourth    *
          bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed.  The      *
          copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as   *
          it arcs away.

          AKBAR, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and      *
          Juno gets into the limo with Helen.  Akbar scrunches into the
          front seat and starts the car.


    270   EXT. RAMP TO HIGHWAY - PREDAWN

          There is just enough light to see some geography.  The island
          is very tiny.  Running right over it and to the horizon in both
          directions is the OVERSEAS HIGHWAY.  The terrorists' trucks
          rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says MIAMI - 110.  The
          limo is the last member of the convoy.  The Aerospatiale passes
          overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots.


    271   EXT. DOCK/ WAREHOUSE - DAWN

          It looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage,
          black smoke, bodies.  Not a living soul around.  The smoke
          swirls as two big BELL 206 HELICOPTERS settle on the middle of
          the dock.  GIB jumps out of the nearest with an AR-15, scanning
          the wreckage.  Several of his men, and a couple of DEA agents,
          spread out.  Gib breaks into a grin as he sees--

          HARRY, materializing out of the swirling smoke.  Dripping wet,
          clothes ripped and bloody.  But okay.

                              GIB
                    I thought this look like your
                    work.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.  I'll brief you in the
                    air.

                              GIB
                    You're welcome.


    272   INT. BELL 206 - DAY

          Gib and Harry are working out of brief-case mobile com-units.
          Several Omega agents with headsets are reading maps, giving
          commands, coordinating the evacuation, mobilizing their own
          forces.  The energy is controlled but very high, everybody
          talking at once.  This is the day they all have trained for.
          It is impressive to watch.

                              GIB
                    --you tell the son of bitch this
                    is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat,
                    a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need
                    a patch of the White House ASAP.
                    That's right--

                              HARRY
                         (overlapping)
                    ... the Coast Guard has to clear
                    them back to a twenty mile
                    radius.  Anybody that can't make
                    the minimum safe distance we need
                    an airlift on, immediately--

          Gib whips around to Harry, lowering his headset mike.

                              GIB
                    I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers
                    here in about 12 minutes.
                    They're on maneuvers out of Boca
                    Chica.

                              HARRY
                         (checking his watch)
                    Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the
                    way in.


    273   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

          TRAFFIC on the two causeways is almost non-existent this early
          in the morning.  The three rental trucks, followed by the limo
          about a mile back, are almost the only vehicles.


    274   INT. LIMO - DAY

          Juno has a 9mm pistol aimed at Helen.  She opens the sunroof,
          letting in the morning air and light.  Then pours herself a
          Scotch from the bar.

                              JUNO
                    Like one?

                              HELEN
                         (eyes like steel)
                    Fuck you.


    275   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          HARRY AND GIB are both talking a mile a minute, coordinating
          the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area.

                              GIB
                    ... well get the Highway Patrol
                    to go through the streets and
                    tell everybody on their damn
                    loudspeakers.  Just the basics...
                    get away from windows, don't look
                    at it... yeah--

                              HARRY
                    Here they come.

          Gib looks out the window in time to see--

          THREE hunch-winged P.S.T.O.L.  HARRIER jets pass them at 600
          knots.

                              HARRY
                         (to the pilots)
                    Roger, Mike Three Five, you are
                    cleared to engage.  Be advised,
                    your targets have Stingers and
                    light machine guns.


    276   INT. COCKPIT OF LEAD HARRIER - DAY

          The pilot, like all jet pilots, seems icy calm.

                              PILOT
                    Copy that, Bright Boy command.
                         (to his wingman)
                    Tally ho.


    277   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

          The terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack
          run, and scramble to get out their Stingers.

          The Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the
          trucks below.  The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of
          the causeway into plumes of spray.


    278   EXT. HIGHWAY - ON TRUCK - DAY

          One of the Bomb trucks is hit.  It explodes and flies off the    *
          bridge into the water.  The terrorists on one of the other
          trucks fire a Stinger missile.


    279   EXT. ABOVE HIGHWAY - ON HARRIER - DAY

          It arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier.  The pilot
          ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes.


    280   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          Harry sees the battle far ahead... the exploding jet.

                              HARRY
                         (to the pilots)
                    Recommend you use your Mavericks                       *
                    to take out the bridge.                                *

                              PILOT (OVER)
                    They won't set off those nukes
                    will they?

                              HARRY
                    Negative, Mike Three Five.
                    That's a negative.
                         (low, to Gib)
                    Probably not.


    281   EXT. HIGHWAY/ OCEAN - DAY

          The two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four    *
          Maverick missiles at the bridge.                                 *


    282   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          The missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and    *
          .  .  .  K-BOOOOM!!  A whole section of the concrete span        *
          collapses into the water.


    283   EXT. HIGHWAY - TRUCKS - DAY

          The first truck is consumed in the blast.  The last truck        *
          slides to the edge of the gap and stops.                         *


    284   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY

          Juno is trying to see what's going on ahead.  All they can see
          is smoke and explosions.  Akbar is speaking heatedly (in
          Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer.

          Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward,
          grabbing the gun.  Juno fires wildly as they struggle for
          control of the weapon.  The sound is deafening in the tiny
          space.  The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he
          slumps forward.  His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal
          and the car surges faster.


    285   EXT. HIGHWAY/ BATTLE SITE - DAY

          The third Harrier fires its 2.75 Rockets and blows the           *
          remaining truck into tinfoil.  Battle over.  Two bombs down.


    286   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          The columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles
          ahead of the copter.

                              HARRY
                    Good shooting, Mike Three Five.
                    I need you to stay on station.
                         (to the copter pilot)                             *
                    Okay.  You see that limo?


    287   INT./ EXT. LIMO - HIGHWAY - DAY                                  *

          THE LIMO tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one
          guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it
          hits.  In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out-
          of-control-train.


    288   INT. LIMO - DAY

          INSIDE, Helen knocks Juno's hands against the edge of the open
          sunroof and the pistol goes flying out.

                              HELEN
                    You... bitch!!

          Helen is raging, grabbing Juno's head and pounding it against
          anything hard she can find inside the car.  Suddenly she stops,
          looking out the front window.  Juno turns too, off her look, to
          see-- ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  The causeway is blown away
          about a quarter mile ahead.

                              JUNO
                    Shit!

          Juno climbs through the window into the front seat, tugging on
          the dead driver.  The heavyset Akbar is like a bag of cement.
          Helen look up through the sunroof and sees--


    289   EXT. ABOVE LIMO - DAY

          THE BELL 206 COPTER, descending rapidly.  Harry is climbing out
          onto the skids.  He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and
          hangs down as low as he can.  HELEN stands up in the opening
          and waves her arms.


    290   INT. / EXT. BELL COPTER/ LIMO - DAY

          Gib is yelling at the DEA pilot, who's not thrilled with this
          idea.

                              GIB
                    Get lower, goddamnit!  Right now!

          Harry strains downward with one hand.  Helen reaches up toward
          him.  The car screeches along the guard-rail, slamming against
          it, throwing her from side to side in the sunroof.  Their
          fingers touch, then separate.  She looks-- the limo is almost
          on the precipice.


    291   INT. LIMO - DAY

          INSIDE THE CAR, Juno is desperately pulling on the inert
          driver.  He slumps over on her, pinning her.  She looks over
          the dash as the shattered edge of the causeway rushes toward
          them--


    292   EXT. LIMO - DAY

          HARRY'S HAND grabs Helen's.  He pulls her out of the car just
          as the limo clears the edge.  She is jerked through the
          sunroof, screaming.  The car falls away, arcing gracefully to
          the ocean below.  It hits with an enormous explosion of water.


    293   INT. / EXT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          HARRY PULLS HELEN up onto the skid with him, getting her
          stable.  She is gasping, holding on for dear life.  She looks
          down at the ocean, the burning wreckage on the bridge, the
          whole unbelievable panorama.

          Then she looks at Harry and-- Grins.  She's alive!  And so is
          he.  And not only that, this is the biggest rush of her life.
          Harry grins back.  Surprised and pleased that she is more of a
          soul-mate than he ever knew.

                                                      CUT TO:


    294   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ANGLE ON A HARRIER, landing in full-hover on the causeway.  The
          shriek of the jet engine is enormous.  It bounces down onto its
          wheels like a big inscect.  The other remaining Harrier is
          already down, behind it.


    295   EXT. BELL 206 - DAY

          TRACKING past burning wreckage to Harry's Bell 206 just
          settling on the highway.  B.G.  the other DEA Bell 206 is
          landing with the Harrier pilot who ejected hanging in a sling.
          Harry jumps out of the open door, followed by Helen and Gib.     *
          Harry looks at his watch.                                        *

                              HARRY
                    Any minute now.

                              GIB
                         (with a megaphone/ to
                          everybody)
                    It's show time.  Don't look at                         *
                    the flash.  Do not look at the
                    flash.

                              HARRY                                        *
                         (to Helen)                                        *
                    We're safe here.                                       *


    296   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY

          Helen and Harry move away from the agents.  They are safe and
          together.  They look at each other, and there is nothing to
          say.  Harry removes her wedding band from the wrong hand and     *
          slips it back onto its rightful finger.                          *

          He leans forward to kiss her.  She reaches for him.  Their lips  *
          meet.


    297   EXT. CAUSEWAY - HARRIERS IN BACKGROUND - DAY

          And they are locked together in that position when the sky
          lights up behind them.  Talk about fireworks.  Harry covers her  *
          eyes and they stay in the kiss.                                  *

          They are in no danger, but the effect is stunning.  The classic  *
          mushroom cloud appears at the horizon.  Helen watches, awed,
          the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    That was some kiss.                                    *

          The two young Harrier pilots stand nearby, watching the
          mushroom disperse.  Gib is with the other Omega agents, his
          finger pressed in his ear, listening to his headset.  He waves
          to Harry to come to him.

          Harry detaches from Helen and walks over to him.  Helen watches
          him go... back to work.  She glances over at the two Harrier
          pilots.

                              HELEN
                         (to the pilots)
                    That's my husband.

          HARRY goes into the huddle with Gib and the others.

                              GIB
                    Malik's copter landed twenty
                    minutes ago in Miami.  He's on
                    the top of a high-rise downtown.
                    SWAT's on the scene, and I got
                    the cops sealing off the area.                         *
                    He renezvous'd there with about                        *
                    a dozen more faction members.                          *
                    They're barricaded on the                              *
                    twentieth floor.
                         (he gets very serious)                            *
                    Harry, they have a hostage.  It's                      *
                    Dana.                                                  *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    My Dana!?

                              GIB
                    They must have grabbed her during
                    the night... we didn't know.
                    Sorry, Harry, I--


    298   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          But Harry is already moving.  He sprints toward the nearest
          Harrier, witch is idling nearby.  Gib runs after him.

                              GIB
                    Harry!  We'll get her out!  We                         *
                    have a man inside already .  .                         *
                    .  Harry!!  Aw, shit... here we
                    go.

          Harry walks up to the young pilot...

                              HARRY
                    I need to borrow this thing for
                    a few minutes.

          He pushes past the pilot before the guy can react.

                              PILOT
                    Excuse me .  .  .  sir?!                               *

                              GIB                                          *
                    Force Comm cleared you to give us                      *
                    total cooperation, right?                              *

                              PILOT                                        *
                    Yessir, but .  .  .                                    *

                              GIB                                          *
                    That's coming right from the                           *
                    President, Captain.                                    *

                              PILOT                                        *
                    Yessir.  Uh .  .  .  sir?  You're                      *
                    going to have to sign for the                          *
                    aircraft.                                              *

                              GIB                                          *
                    I'll sign for it.  You got a pen?                      *
                         (one of the agents                                *
                          pulls out a pen)                                 *
                    Here, he'll sign for it.                               *

          Harry is in the cockpit by now.  Gib climbs up.                  *

                              GIB
                    I'd like to remind you that it
                    has been ten years since you were
                    actually in one of these.

                              HARRY
                    If I break it they can take it
                    out of my pay.


    299   INT. HARRIER - DAY

          Harry doesn't have a G-suit or a helmet of anything.  He just
          has his walky on his belt.

          INSIDE THE CRAMPED COCKPIT, Harry looks around for the lever
          which vectors the thrust.  Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees
          (vertical).  He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle
          up to FULL.

                              GIB
                         (to pilot)
                    It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds
                    of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops,
                    cross-training and all that.

                              AGENT
                    Harry can fly anything.

          The big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee.

                              GIB
                    He's a little rusty.  It's like
                    riding a bicycle .  .  .  you
                    never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd
                    seek shelter!

          It drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way.
          At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips
          the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar.  It lifts
          unsteadily straight into the sky.  It turns around 180.

                              GIB
                    He's got it.

                              HARRY
                    Sorry.

          Harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles
          turn, accelerating the plane forward.


    300   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY

          Gib is standing, watching Harry go.  He never believes this
          guy.  Harry's voice comes over the walky...

                              HARRY
                    Tell Helen what's going on.  Tell
                    her I love her.  And ask the
                    pilot where the button for the
                    20mm cannon is-- never mind.  I
                    found it.

          The plane disappears toward Miami.


    301   EXT. HIGH RISE - MIAMI - DAY

          AN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.  It is an unfinished
          building in the high rise district.  The Aerospatiale sits on
          the roof, its rotor turning slowly.  The street below is jammed
          with cars.  Honking horns echo up the glass canyons.


    302   EXT. STREET - DAY

          ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to
          clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter
          two blocks away.


    303   INT. HIGH RISE - DAY

          INSIDE THE HIGH RISE the terrorists have barricaded themselves
          on the twentieth floor.  There are 12 TERRORISTS, all with
          automatic weapons.  Occasionally one of them will fire a burst
          down a stairwell with an AK-47.  Miami-Dade SWAT team members
          are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance.


    304   INT. HIGH RISE - ON THE 21ST FLOOR - DAY

          Malik is sequestered with the bomb.  It sits on the floor,
          still in its shipping case.  Dana stands nearby, looking
          scares.  She is not ties up.  Where can she go?

          She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key.
          He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video-
          tapes demands are running on CNN.  Harry's face fills the
          screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat.  He
          is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER,
          ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.  Dana stares at her father's face on
          the national news.  It's like a bad dream.  She has been crying
          but she is fairly composed now.

                              DANA
                    I have to go to the bathroom.

          The terrorists ignore her.  A terrified ACTION NEWS REPORTER
          and his CAMERAMAN, under guard by TWO TERRORISTS, are hastily
          setting up to shoot Malik.
                              CAMERAMAN
                    Tape is rolling.

                              MALIK
                    This is a communique from Crimson
                    Jihad.  You have heard from your
                    own expert.  You have seen the
                    Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do
                    not force us to destroy this
                    city.  And do not try to use
                    force against us.  I can trigger
                    this bomb instantly.  All I have
                    to do is turn that key...
                         (he points fiercely at
                          the bomb)
                    ... and five million of your
                    people will die.

          The reporter glances down, nervously.

                              REPORTER
                    What key?

                              MALIK
                         (pointing like the
                          guy's blind)
                    That key right there!

          Malik looks down.  The key is gone.

                              MALIK
                         (to his men)
                    Someone has stolen the key!

          He turns, looking around wildly.  Malik then sees Dana running
          for the stairwell to the roof.  He pulls a pistol and shoots at
          her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door.  He runs
          after her.


    305   EXT. BUILDING / ROOF - DAY

          ON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.  His TWO
          MEN have followed him.  Malik stops suddenly when he sees--
          Dana standing at the edge of the roof.  She is holding the
          ARMING KEY by its chain.  Dangling it over the edge.  He
          signals to his men not to fire.

                              DANA
                         (terrified, but
                          thinking)
                    You shoot me, this'll fall.

          Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.  She backs
          up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof.
          Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest.

                              DANA
                    Don't come any closer.  I'll drop
                    it!  I swear to God.

                              MALIK
                    If you drop it, I will have no
                    reason not to kill you.

          He advances, calling her bluff.  She backs away from him along
          the edge.

                              MALIK
                    Come on, child.  Give me the key.
                         (smiling)
                    Don't you want to live?  I give
                    you my word.

                              DANA
                    No way you whacko.

          She reaches the corner of the building.  Her back touches
          something.  it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting
          building supplies.  Careful to keep the key dangling over open
          space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out
          beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off
          Malik.  She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking
          clearly.

          Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows
          she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a
          game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana
          puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It
          is windy and the boom is swinging.


    306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY

          The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar
          and look toward the window.


    307   EXT. HIGH RISE - DAY

          RISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER.
          It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet
          outside.  The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as
          Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon.


    308   INT. / EXT. HIGH RISE - 20TH FLOOR - DAY

          Glass explodes into glittering mist, and terrorists explodes
          into bloody spray as Harry pivots the plane and the cannon
          sweeps the floor clear from side to side.  The Crimson Jihad is
          vaporized.


    309   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY

          Malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing, but from
          where he is he can't see what's going on.  He focuses on the
          key.  He must have that key.


    310   EXT. ROOF - NEAR HELICOPTER - DAY

          Malik's TWO REMAINING MEN run to the helicopter, gesticulating
          to the pilot to get ready to take off.  The pilot revs the
          turbine and the rotor whirls faster.  The two men jump in,
          picking up M-60 machine guns.


    311   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY

          MALIK IS STILL ADVANCING out the crane boom.  Dana slips as she
          backs up, toppling off the boom.  She is hanging now by her
          hands over a 20 story drop.

          Malik is almost to her.  He needs a hand free to grab her.  He
          sets his gun down on the girder.  He grabs for her wrist.


    312   EXT. ROOF - OVERLOOKING EDGE - DAY

          ANGLE LOOKING DOWN.  Malik, Dana, the street far below.  With
          an unbelievable roar the Harrier sweeps in beneath Dana,
          FILLING FRAME.


    313   EXT. CRANE BOOM / OVER EDGE - DAY

          Harry has the canopy up.  Malik sees Harry, ten feet below.
          His eyes narrow with an all-consuming rage.  He glances at the
          pistol on the beam.  Back at the girl, the key in her teeth--
          So close.

          Harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under Dana.

                              HARRY
                         (shouting)
                    Let go baby!  I've got you!
                    Daddy's got you!


    314   EXT. ROOF / HARRIER - DAY

          Malik lunges for her wrist.  She screams and lets go-- Dana
          drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet-- Harry grabs
          her with his left hand, right hand still on the stick-- He
          holds her until she can get a grip.  She is lying across the
          nose of the plane.  Harry starts to bank away and--


    315   EXT. CRANE BOOM - DAY

          Malik shrieks in rage.  He grabs his 9mm pistol and leaps off
          the crane--


    316   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          Onto the back of the plane.  He starts crawling toward the
          cockpit.  Dana screams and Harry looks back, but just then--


    317   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          The Aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of
          them-- The door-gunner OPENS FIRE.


    318   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          Harry banks hard, taking the hits under the wing.  He pivots
          and slides sideways around the building, playing tag with the
          copter.

          He can't do anything radical enough to dislodge Malik without
          tossing off his own daughter.


    319   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          The helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the
          doors.  Harry pivots the plane and FIRES THE NOSE CANNON.  The
          helicopter is riddled.  It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating
          out of control.


    320   EXT. BUILDING - ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL - DAY

          As the copter hits the ground and explodes.  Fortunately the
          police had created a cleared perimeter.


    321   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          THE HARRIER dips and slews, half out of control.  Malik is
          taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head.  Harry grabs
          his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his
          strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens
          fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming--
          He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge--
          Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The
          last Sidewinder missile.


    322   EXT. HARRIER / SIDEWINDER - DAY

          Harry and Malik lock eyes for one long second.  Then Harry hits
          the FIRING STUD.  The Sidewinder drops away and ignites.
          Carrying Malik out over Miami Beach.  It explodes a mile out to
          sea.


    323   INT. HARRIER - COCKPIT - DAY

          HARRY PULLS DANA into the cockpit, settling her on his lap.

                              HARRY
                    Don't touch the stick, baby.

          She stares at her father in amazement.  He banks away from the
          building, accelerating the jet.  He grins at her.  Raises one
          eyebrow.  Woggles the plane's wings.

                              HARRY
                    Hi, pumpkin.


          ONE YEAR LATER


    324   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dinner at home, and everybody's there.  We come in on the end
          of some story that everybody thinks is hysterical.

                              HELEN
                    ... you should have seen your
                    father, standing there all
                    covered with spaghetti sauce.  He
                    looked like such a dope.

                              HARRY
                    I told the guy---
                         (snorts, it's too
                          funny)
                    I told the guy, this isn't even
                    my order.

          Dana is laughing too, a part of it.  They are happy.  They are
          a family.  Dana gets up, her meal half-eaten as usual.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

          She heads for the front door.

                              HARRY
                    I seem to remember something
                    about a history project that's
                    due tomorrow.

                              DANA
                         ( busted)
                    Dad.  You just think you know
                    everything, don't you?

          Dana trudges off to her room to do her homework.  The phone
          rings.  Helen answers.

                              VOICE
                    Boris and Doris?

                              HELEN
                         (calmly, signalling
                          Harry with her eyes)
                    Go ahead.


    325   INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

          It is a black tie affair.  Very glitzy.  CAMERA SWOOPS over the
          guests, sipping champagne and dancing.  It is an embassy crowd,
          very international.  HARRY AND HELEN work their way through the
          crowd.  He is in tux, hair slicked back, looking rakish.  She
          is elegant in a low-cut gown and diamond choker.

          Harry scoops two glasses of champagne off a passing tray and
          hands her one.


    326   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          VERY CLOSE ON GIB, hunches in a dark van someplace nearby.  He
          speaks into his headset mike.

                              GIB
                    So, what's the scoop, team?  You
                    see your contact yet?


    327   INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          HELEN AND HARRY smile and nod as if they know people.  Speaking
          very low, Helen answer Gib via SUB-VOCAL transceiver.

                              HELEN
                    Not yet.  But we'll find him.

                              HARRY
                    Dance?

          He whirls her across the floor and the CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP
          as they dance.

                                                      FADE OUT

                            The END

          INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

          Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
          one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    This lighter-than-air craft was
                    designed by Muntz himself, and is
                    longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
                    wagons placed end to end.

          Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
          and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And here comes the adventurer now!

          

                                                                     2.

          

          
          NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the
          gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Never apart from his faithful dogs,
                    Muntz conceived the craft for
                    canine comfort! It's a veritable
                    floating palace in the sky...

          
          An opulent dining room.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    ...complete with doggie bath and
                    mechanical canine walker.

          
          One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
          second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
                    consider Muntz the bee's knees!
                    And how!

          
          Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
          "thumbs up" stance.

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.

                               NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    But what has Muntz brought back
                    this time?

          
          Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a
          curtained object.

                              MUNTZ
                    Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
                    of Paradise Falls!

          He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.

          

                              CROWD
                    Ooh!
          Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And golly, what a swell monster
                    this is. But what's this?

          Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.

          

                                                                        3.

          

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Scientists cry foul! The National
                    Explorers Society accuses Muntz of
                    fabricating the skeleton!

          

                                 YOUNG CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
          famous explorers.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    The organization strips Muntz of
                    his membership.

          
          Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED
          from his jacket.
          Carl GASPS.

          
          Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly
          addresses the crowd.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
                    Paradise Falls and promises to
                    capture the beast... alive!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I promise to capture the beast...
                    alive!

          
          In the theater, young Carl smiles.

                              MUNTZ
                    And I will not come back until I do!
          The crowd CHEERS.

          
          Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
          lifts off.

                                 NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And so the    explorer is off to clear
                    his name.     Bon voyage Charles
                    Muntz, and    good luck capturing the
                    Monster of    Paradise Falls!
          Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.

          

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, 1930'S - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of
          Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.
          He still wears helmet and goggles.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Yes, as Muntz himself says:
                    "Adventure is--"

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    "Adventure is out there!"
          Carl stops.   Who said that?

          
          The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up
          and lawn overgrown with weeds.
          The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to
                    starboard. Must get the Spirit of
                    Adventure over Mount Rushmore...

          

                                                                       5.

          

          
          Carl walks toward the voice.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hold together old girl. How're my
                    dogs doing? Ruff ruff!

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.   He
          follows the voice toward the living room.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    All engines ahead full! Let's take
                    her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders
                    eighteen degrees towards the south.

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl rounds the corner to see...

          
          ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely
          visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,
          her overalls are patched and dirty.
          The old house has been transformed into a make-believe
          dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty
          old bicycle.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    It's a beautiful day, winds out of
                    the east at ten knots.
                    Visibility... unlimited.
                        (yells a command)
                    Enter the weather in the logbook!
          The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage.

          
          Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Oh! There's something down there!
                    I will bring it back for science.
                    Awwww, it's a puppy!

          
          Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to
          the wall.

          

                               YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.)
                    No time!   A storm! Lightning! Hail!
          Ellie pops up in front of Carl.

          

                                                                    6.

          

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    What are you doing!?!

          
          Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through
          a broken part of the ceiling and disappears.
          Ellie circles Carl accusingly.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Don't you know this is an exclusive
                    club? Only explorers get in here.
                    Not just any kid off the street
                    with a helmet and a pair of
                    goggles. Do you think you got what
                    it takes? Well, do you?!?

          
          Carl FUMPHERS.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.
          She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    What's wrong? Can't you talk?
          Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Hey, I don't bite.
          She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all
          directions.
          She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
          pins it on Carl.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    You and me, we're in a club now.

          
          Carl smiles.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    I saw where your balloon went.
                    Come on, let's go get it!

          
          Carl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in.

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    My name's Ellie.

          
          She grabs his hand.
          Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room.

          

                                                                     7.

          

          

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS


          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       There it is.

          
          Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between
          them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, go ahead.
          She pushes him out onto the beam.

                                    YOUNG ELLIE
                       Go on.

          
          Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts
          forward... and FALLS through the floor.

                                                            CUT TO:

          One lone light on upstairs.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S ROOM

          Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST.

          
          Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON.
          Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright.

          

                                    YOUNG CARL
                              (re: arm)
                       Ow!

          
          A head pops up from outside the open window.

          

                                    YOUNG ELLIE
                       Hey kid!!

          
          Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast.

          

                                    YOUNG CARL
                       Ow!!

          

                                                                    8.

          

          
          Ellie climbs in the window.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Thought you might need a little
                       cheerin' up. I got somethin' to
                       show ya!

          

          INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER


          
          The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie
          whispers, as if to protect a National Secret.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       I am about to let you see something
                       I have never shown to another human
                       being. Ever. In my life.
          Carl's eyes widen in alarm.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       You'll have to swear you will not
                       tell anyone.
          Carl nods.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Cross your heart. Do it!
          Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils...

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       My Adventure Book!
          It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"
          written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       You know him.
          Carl smiles excitedly.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
                       big, I'm going where he's going:
                       South America.
          She turns the page to a map.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       It's like America... but south.
                       Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

          

                                                                   9.

          

          
          She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand-
          drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                           (reading caption)
                       "Paradise Falls, a land lost in
                       time." I ripped this right out of
                       a library book.

          
          Carl GASPS in horror.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,
                       and park it right next to the
                       falls. Who knows what lives up
                       there? And once I get there...

          
          She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF
          I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, I'm saving these pages for
                       all the adventures I'm gonna have.
                       Only... I just don't know how I'm
                       gonna get to Paradise Falls.
          Ellie closes the book, disappointed.

          
          Carl has a thought.    He looks at his toy dirigible.

          

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       That's it! You can take us there
                       in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
                       Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross
                       your heart.

          
          Carl does.

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Good. You promised. No backing out.

          
          Carl shakes his head "no."

                                 YOUNG ELLIE
                       Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye.

          
          Ellie hops up and jumps out the window.

                                YOUNG ELLIE
                       "Adventure is out there!!"

          
          She pops back in.

          

                                                                    10.

          

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    You know, you don't talk very much.
                    I like you.

          
          Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.   He rests
          his head on his balloon.

          

                              YOUNG CARL
                    Wow.

          
          The balloon pops.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          INT. CHURCH - DAY


          
          FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and
          Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss.

          
          Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.     A
          gun shot is fired in the air.

          
          Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely.

          

          EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY


          
          Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.   It's the same house
          where they met as kids.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY


          
          They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room.

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY


          
          Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX.
          Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint
          handprint on the mailbox! Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint
          as well. They smile.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING
          from her childhood Adventure Book.

          

                                                                   11.

          

          

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY


          
          They run up a hillside together.

          
          They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the
          clouds. He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle.

          
          Carl closes his eyes and smiles.   He's lucky to be with her.

          

          EXT. ZOO - DAY


          
          Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her
          Zookeeper's uniform.

          
          Carl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform. Behind him
          the balloons lift his cart off the ground. Carl jumps to
          catch it. She giggles.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY


          
          Carl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading.
          Without looking up from their books, they hold hands.

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY


          
          Again at their picnic spot, they watch clouds. Ellie sees an
          elephant with wings. Carl gives it a try and points out a
          BABY. Ellie lights up, excited. She sees ALL the clouds as
          babies! Carl is stunned... but smiles.

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, BABY ROOM - DAY


          
          Ellie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a
          bundle in its beak. Carl hangs a mobile above the crib.

          

          

          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

          Carl touches Ellie's shoulder as the doctor explains.   Ellie
          drops her head in her hands.

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Carl looks out the window.   Ellie sits alone under a tree,
          the wind in her hair.

          

                                                                    12.

          

          

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, YARD - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl joins Ellie.   He hands her the Adventure Book. She smiles.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Ellie paints a MURAL of their house atop Paradise Falls over
          the mantle. Carl organizes a compass, map, binoculars, and
          native bird figurine beneath the painting. It's their shrine
          to Adventure.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it.
          Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses
          her heart. Carl crosses his.

          

          A SERIES OF SHOTS

          
          The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change.
          Their car blows a tire.
          The two stand by the jar, reluctant.   Carl BREAKS the jar.

          
          New tire.

          
          Carl in the hospital with a broken leg.

          
          Breaking jar.
          A storm rages.   A tree falls, crushing the roof.

          
          Breaking jar.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - MORNING


          
          Carl struggles to tie his tie.   Ellie helps.   They walk out
          the front door arm in arm.

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER

          Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door.

          
          A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.    Stylish
          1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties.

          

                                                                      13.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 30 YEARS LATER


          
          Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror.

          

          EXT. ZOO - DAY


          
          Carl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at
          the zoo. Carl's cart lifts off the ground. He casually
          leans an elbow on it.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Carl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight. The
          PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and
          forgotten.

          

          INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM WINDOW - AFTERNOON

          Carl cleans the inside of the window.    Ellie cleans the
          outside.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl vacuums the Adventure Shrine on the mantle. Carl smiles
          at a photo of Ellie as a child, wearing her flight helmet and
          goggles. He looks up at the mural of their house at Paradise
          Falls. His smile fades.

          
          Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.    Their dream has gone
          unfulfilled.

          
          Carl has an idea.

          

          EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY


          
          Carl buys two tickets to South America.

          

          EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill.    He hides the airline
          tickets in his basket.
          Behind him, Ellie falters and falls.    She tries to get up but
          falls again. Something is wrong.

          
          He runs to her.

          

                                                                    14.

          

          

          

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY


          
          Ellie lies in a hospital bed.    She looks through her

          ADVENTURE BOOK.

          
          A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.

          
          Carl stands at the door.   He smiles and walks to her bedside.

          
          Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.    She weakly pats
          his cheek and adjusts his tie.

          
          He kisses her on the forehead.

          

          INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON


          
          Carl sits alone, next to a huge bouquet of balloons.

          

          EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK


          
          Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - MORNING - SEVERAL YEARS LATER

          An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.    An aged hand shuts it off and picks
          up the nearby glasses.

          
          CARL sits alone in his double bed.   He rubs his face. GRUNTS.
          He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.

          
          He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom
          spokes.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER

          Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the
          staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.

          
          Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.    He bangs
          the armrest and the chair restarts.

          

          INT. CARL'S KITCHEN - LATER


          
          Carl eats breakfast by himself.

          

                                                                      15.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM WINDOW - LATER


          
          Carl cleans the window with a cloth.    His lonely reflection
          stares back at him.

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - LATER


          
          Carl dusts the mantle and Shrine to Adventure.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - LATER

          Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and
          considers his reflection. He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.
          The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.      Carl
          GRUMBLES in frustration.
          Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door
          shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.

          
          He sits in his porch chair.

          

          EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not
          under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily.
          High rise buildings are being erected all around.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - MORNING


          
          Carl looks at the activity around him.

          

                              CARL
                    Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
                        (noticing mailbox)
                    Uhp, mail's here.

          
          Carl walks to the mailbox.    He touches Ellie's faded
          HANDPRINT and smiles.

          
          He looks through the mail.

          
          He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of
          images of happy old people. Carl scoffs.

          

                                                                   16.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.

          
          Carl notices DUST on his mailbox.

          

                              CARL
                    Hm.

          
          He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.   He revs it and blasts off the dust.

          
          TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
                    Need any help there?

          

                              CARL
                    No. Yes. Tell your boss over there
                    that you boys are ruining our house.

          
          He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking
          on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Well just to let you know, my boss
                    would be happy to take this old
                    place off your hands, and for
                    double his last offer. Whaddya say
                    to that?
          The leaf blower blasts off his hat.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Uh, I take that as a no, then.

                              CARL
                    I believe I made my position to
                    your boss quite clear.

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

          

                              CARL
                    Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let
                    me talk to him.

          
          Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE.

          

                              CARL
                        (in megaphone)
                    You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a
                    bath, hippy!

          
          Tom grabs the megaphone.

          

                                                                  17.

          

          

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                        (to Boss, re Carl)
                    I am not with him!
                        (to Carl)
                    This is serious. He's out to get
                    your house!

          
          Carl walks to his front door.

          

                              CARL
                    Tell your boss he can have our house.

          

                                 CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    Really?

          

                              CARL
                    When I'm dead!
          Carl SLAMS the door.

                              CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
                    I'll take that as a maybe!

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER


          
          Carl sits in his chair watching TV.

          
          A KNOCK at the door.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY


          
          The door opens.
          A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness
          Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash,
          neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every
          piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8.
          Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My name is
                    Russell. And I am a Wilderness
                    Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge
                    12. Are you in need of any
                    assistance today, sir?"

          
          As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.

          

                                 CARL
                    No.

          

                                                                   18.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross the street.

          

                               CARL
                    No.

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross your yard.

          

                               CARL
                    No.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I could help you cross your... porch?

          

                               CARL
                    No.

                               RUSSELL
                    Well, I gotta help you cross
                    something.

          

                               CARL
                    Uh, no.   I'm doing fine.

          
          Carl closes the door in Russell's face.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone?   He opens it.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My name is
                    Russell."

          

                              CARL
                    Uh... kid...

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "And I am a Wilderness Explorer in
                    Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."

                               CARL
                    Kid.   KID!!

          
          Russell stops... but goes back to reading.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Are you in need of any assistance
                    today Sir?"

                              CARL
                    Thank you, but I don't need any help!

          

                                                                     19.

          

          
          Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ow.

          
          Carl opens the door.    Russell stands at attention.

          

                              CARL

                        (RESIGNED)
                    Proceed.

                              RUSSELL
                    "Good afternoon. My-"

                              CARL
                    But skip to the end!

          
          Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except
          for one glaringly empty space.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    See these? These are my Wilderness
                    Explorer badges. You may notice
                    one is missing. It's my Assisting
                    the Elderly badge. If I get it I
                    will become a Senior Wilderness
                    Explorer!
          Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
          fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    "The wilderness must be explored!

                    CAW-CAW! RAAAR!"

          
          This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.

                              RUSSELL
                    It's gonna be great! There's a big
                    ceremony, and all the dads come,
                    and they pin on our badges...

                              CARL
                    So you want to assist an old
                    person?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yep! Then I will be a Senior
                    Wilderness Explorer!
          Carl leans in close to Russell.

          

                                                                  20.

          

          

                              CARL

                        (CONSPIRATORIALLY)
                    You ever heard of a snipe?

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Snipe?

          

                              CARL
                    Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it
                    sneaks in my yard and gobbles my
                    poor azaleas. I'm elderly and
                    infirm. I can't catch it. If only
                    someone could help me...

                               RUSSELL
                    Me! Me!   I'll do it!

          

                              CARL
                    Oh, I don't know, it's awfully
                    crafty. You'd have to clap your
                    hands three times to lure it in.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!

          

                              CARL
                    I think its burrow is two blocks
                    down. If you go past --

                              RUSSELL
                    Two blocks down! Got it!

          
          Russell runs down the block clapping and calling.

                              RUSSELL
                    Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...

                              CARL
                        (calls after Russell)
                    Bring it back here when you find
                    it!
          Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

          
          He stops short.

          
          A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to

          ELLIE'S MAILBOX.

          

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    Okay, keep her coming... And...
                    stop. Stop! STOP!!
          The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.

          

                                                                      21.

          

          
          Carl is shocked.   He runs to the box.

          

                              CARL
                    What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you
                    think you're doing?

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    I am so sorry, sir...

          
          The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it.

                              CARL
                    Don't touch that!

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    No no, let me take care of that for you.

          
          Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker.

                              CARL

                        (STRUGGLING)
                    Get away from our mailbox!

          

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
                    Hey sir, I...

                              CARL
                    I don't want you to touch it!
          Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk.
          The worker rubs his head.    Blood.

          
          Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.     What
          has he done?

          
          Passerbys stare.
          Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

          
          Carl backs into his house.

          

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM


          
          Carl shuts his door.   He closes the curtains.
          He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his
          feet. A police car pulls up.

          
          The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.     His
          hand rests on Carl's fence.

          

                                                                     22.

          

          

          

          INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY


          
          Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons.

          

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY


          
          A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.    The REAL ESTATE
          DEVELOPER watches him enter.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING

          A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate.

          

                               OFFICER EDITH
                    Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't
                    seem like a public menace to me.
                    Take this.

          
          She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

          

                              OFFICER EDITH
                    The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
                    to pick you up in the morning, okay?
          The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.

          
          Carl faces the house.    He touches Ellie's dented mailbox.

          

                              CARL
                    What do I do now, Ellie?

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT


          
          All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock.
          The empty hall.

          
          The front hall mirror.
          The kitchen.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, CLOSET

          Carl pulls out a suitcase.   A book tips over.   Ellie's
          Adventure Book.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book.

          

                                                                       23.

          

          
          He turns to the page marked "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO."    He
          closes the book and sighs.

          
          Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their
          house by Paradise Falls.
          He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.

          
          Carl's brows furrow.    He looks up at the shrine, and crosses
          his heart.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Lights are on inside the house.

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MORNING


          
          A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.
          Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK.
          Carl answers, holding a suitcase.

          

                              CARL
                    Morning gentlemen.

                              NURSE GEORGE
                    Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.    You
                    ready to go?

          

                               CARL
                    Ready as I'll ever be. Would you
                    do me a favor and take this?

          
          Carl hands over his suitcase.

          

                              CARL
                    I'll meet you at the van in just a
                    minute. I... want to say one last
                    goodbye to the old place.

          

                               NURSE GEORGE
                    Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir.

          
          Carl closes the door.   Rather sharply.   The nurses head back
          to the van.

          

                                                                     24.

          

          

                                NURSE A.J.
                      Typical. He's probably going to the
                      bathroom for the eightieth time.

          
          Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn.

                                 NURSE GEORGE
                      You'd think he'd take better care
                      of his house.

          
          A SHADOW falls over the nurses.   They turn to look.

          
          A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.     It unfolds to reveal

          THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS.

          
          The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus
          cloud forming a thunderhead above the house.
          Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains.     Pipes bend,
          then break. Electrical wires spark and snap.
          The house rips away from its foundation.

          
          The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.    Carl
          looks out the window and LAUGHS.

                                CARL
                      So long boys! I'll send you a
                      postcard from Paradise Falls!

          

          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS


          
          Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the
          house floats past.

          

          EXT. TOWN


          
          The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection.

          

          EXT. SHOP WINDOW


          
          A family watches the house float down the street.

          

          EXT. ABOVE THE TOWN


          
          Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively
          waves back.
          The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away
          from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance.

          

                                                                   25.

          Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW


          
          Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the
          windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes
          attached to the weather vane.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE

          The house turns.
          Carl looks out the window, satisfied.   He checks the balloons.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl kisses a photo of Ellie.

          

                              CARL
                    We're on our way, Ellie.
          Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings
          tied to the grate.
          He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes
          and smiles.
          SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

          The house drifts through the clouds.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Carl relaxes in his chair.

          

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

          

                               CARL
                    Huh?

          

                                                                      26.

          

          
          He stares at the front door.   Nothing.

          

                               CARL
                    Hm.

          

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

          
          He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep
          hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Nothing. He looks left.     Nothing.   He looks right.   Russell.
          He looks... Russell?!!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me,
                    Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    What are you doing out here, kid?

          
          Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and
          holding on for dear life.

                              RUSSELL
                    I found the snipe and I followed it
                    under your porch, but this snipe
                    had a long tail and looked more
                    like a large mouse.

          
          The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through
          the clouds.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Please let me in?

                               CARL
                    No.

          
          Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone.
          Beat. The door opens again.

          

                              CARL
                    Oh, alright, you can come...
          Russell runs into the house past Carl.

          

                               CARL
                    ...in.

          

                                                                   27.

          

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell PANTS, panicked.   He looks into living room.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Huh. I've never been in a floating
                    house before.

          
          Carl follows Russell into the living room.   Russell chuckles
          and points at the photo of young Ellie.

                               RUSSELL
                    Goggles.   Look at this stuff!
          Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of
          the open atlas.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Wow, you going on a trip?
                        (reads from the engraving)
                    "Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in
                    Time." You going to South America,
                    Mr. Fredricksen?
          Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.

                              CARL
                    Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.

                              RUSSELL
                    You know, most people take a plane,
                    but you're smart because you'll have
                    all your TV and clocks and stuff.
          Russell runs over to the steering rig.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Whoah.   Is this how you steer your
                    house?   Does it really work?

          

                              CARL
                    Kid, would you stop with the --
          Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and
          forth.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh, this makes it go right, and
                    that way's left.

          

                              CARL
                    Let go of the -- knock it off!
          Russell looks out the window in front of him.

          

                                                                    28.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey look, buildings!

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

          Russell and Carl arrive at the window.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That building's so close I could
                    almost touch it.

          
          That gives Carl an idea.

                                                              CUT TO:

          
          Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house.

                              RUSSELL
                    Wow! This is great! You should try
                    this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's
                    a bus that could take me home two
                    blocks away!
                        (looking up)
                    Hey, I can see your house from here!

                              CARL
                        (struggling to hold on)
                    Don't jerk around so much, kid!

          
          The rope slips through Carl's hands.   Russell FALLS.

          

                                                              CUT TO:
          Carl stands beside Russell at the window.    Russell's fall had
          been a daydream.

                              CARL
                    Well, that's not gonna work.

          
          Carl leaves Russell at the window.

                              RUSSELL
                    I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo
                    Nimbus. Did you know that the
                    Cumulo Nimbus...

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon
          strings with his housekeys.

          

                                                                     29.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Stayed up all night blowing up
                    balloons, for what?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    ...warm air goes by cool air, and
                    the airs go by each other and
                    that's how we get lightning.

          

                              CARL
                    That's nice, kid.

          
          Carl turns off his hearing aid.    Silence.   He smiles.
          Russell tries to get Carl's attention.   A storm is brewing in
          the distance.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (nearly silent)
                    Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big
                    storm coming. It's starting to get
                    scary. We're gonna get blown to
                    bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.
                    Fredricksen!

          
          A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room.    Carl turns
          on his hearing aid.

          

                              CARL
                    What are you doing over there?

                                RUSSELL

          Carl joins Russell at the window.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    See?    Cumulo Nimbus.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.
          Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the
          storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying.

          
          Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house
          is rocked in the storm.
          Russell's backpack slides toward the front door.

          

                                                                       30.

                    My pack!

          
          Russell HOPS on top of the backpack.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Got ya!

          
          The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams.
          He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door
          swings shut.

          
          The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl.     He chases after it.
          Ellie's chair slides across the room.      Carl gasps and runs to
          protect it.

          
          The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.     Carl
          lunges to catch it.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The storm rages.    The house is tossed into the storm clouds.
          All goes black.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Carl is asleep.
          A finger pokes Carl's face.     Nothing.

          
          The finger pokes Carl's face again.    Carl WAKES UP.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Whew!    I thought you were dead.

                              CARL
                    Wha... what happened?

          
          Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd
          been protecting.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    I steered us. I did!      I steered
                    the house!

                              CARL
                    Steered us?

          

                                                                  31.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    After you tied your stuff down you
                    took a nap, so I went ahead and
                    steered us down here.

          Carl opens the window and looks out.

                    Huh?

                    Oh we're in South America all
                    right. It was a cinch, with my
                    Wilderness Explorer GPS.

          
          Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT.

                    GP-what?

                              RUSSELL
                    My dad gave it to me. It shows
                    exactly where we are on the planet.
                    With this baby, we'll never be lost!
          Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.

          Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the

                    We'll get you down, find a bus
                    stop. You just tell the man you

                    Sure, but I don't think they have
                    busses in Paradise Falls.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


                              CARL
                    There. That ought to do it. Here,
                    I'll give you some change for bus fare.

          
          Russell follows Carl toward the front door.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING


          
          The house lowers into the fog.

          

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Whoah, that's gonna be like a
                    billion transfers to get back to my
                    house.

          

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH

          Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down
          into and through the thick, dark clouds.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

          

                              CARL
                    Well, we're up pretty high.   Could
                    take hours to get down.
          Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward.

          

                                                                    33.

          

          

                                CARL

                         (MUMBLING)
                     ...that thing was...building or
                     something.

          
          Another dark object whooshes past them.   Carl ducks.

          

                               RUSSELL
                     What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

          

                               CARL
                     We can't be close to the ground yet.

          
          A brief view of rocks directly below them.

          
          Carl GASPS.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE


          
          BAM!!!   The house CRASHES into the ground.

          
          Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground.   They
          land hard.

          
          Carl's house is floating away!

          
          Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground.

                               CARL
                     Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!

          
          Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air.

                                CARL
                     Whoah!   Hey, hey!
          Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them
          to the ground.

          

                               CARL
                     Russell, hang on!
          Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.

          

                                  RUSSELL
                     Whoah!
          They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is
          thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.

          

                                  CARL
                     Walk back!     Walk back!

          

                                                                    34.

          

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Okay!

          
          Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.
          Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.
          Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only
          scattered rocks.

          

                              CARL
                        (out of breath)
                    Where... where are we?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    This doesn't look like the city or
                    the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
          The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.

          

                              CARL
                        (to house)
                    Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
          The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
          flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

          
          Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.
          Carl stares.   He can't believe it.

          

                               CARL
                    There it is. Ellie, it's so
                    beautiful.

          
          The landscape is stunning.

          
          Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of
          the house atop the falls.

          

                              CARL
                    We made it. We made it! Russell,
                    we could float right over there.
                    Climb up. Climb up!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You mean assist you?

          

                              CARL
                    Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Okay, I'll climb up!

          
          Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.

          

                                                                  35.

          

          

                                 CARL
                    Watch it.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Sorry.
          The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.

          

                              CARL
                    Now, when you get up there, go
                    ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!

          
          Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.

                              CARL
                    You on the porch yet?!

          
          Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.
          He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.

          

                              CARL
                    What? That's it?! I came all this
                    way just to get stuck at the wrong
                    end of this rock pile? Aw, great!

          
          Carl paces.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, if I could assist you over
                    there, would you sign off on my
                    badge?

          

                              CARL
                    What are you talking about?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    We could walk your house to the
                    falls!

          

                                 CARL
                    Walk it?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
                    We could walk it right over there.
                    Like a parade balloon.
          Carl considers this.

          

                                                                    36.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER


          
          The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the
          house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear
          the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk.

                              CARL
                    Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
                    quickly and quietly, with no rap
                    music or flash-dancing.
          Russell inspects his surroundings.

                              RUSSELL

                        (DISTRACTED)
                    Uh-huh.

          

                              CARL
                    We have three days, at best, before
                    the helium leaks out of those
                    balloons. And if we're not at the
                    falls when that happens...

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Sand!

                              CARL
                    ...we're not getting to the falls!

                              RUSSELL
                    I found sand!

          
          Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house.

                              CARL
                    Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get
                    our house over there.
          Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Huh.
                        (shrugs it off)
                    This is fun already, isn't it? By
                    the time we get there, you're gonna
                    feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.
                    Fredricksen, if we happen to get
                    separated, use the Wilderness
                    Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!

          
          The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid.

          

                                                                      37.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Wait. Why are we going to Paradise
                    Falls again?

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, let's play a game. It's
                    called: "See who can be quiet the
                    longest."

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Cool!   My mom loves that game!

          
          They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY

          Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.
          Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.

          
          Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light.
          Hunters.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

          The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal
          cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.

          
          The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

          The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a
          sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each
          wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.

          
          They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible.
          WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the
          three dogs and escaping in a flash.

          
          The dogs head off in pursuit.
          A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears
          wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

          

                                                                   38.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl steps out from behind a shrub.   The SQUEALING is in fact
          his HEARING AID.

          

                              CARL
                    Darn thing.
                        (calling back)
                    C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?

          
          Russell plods forward, dragging his feet.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.

          

                              CARL
                    Which knee?

                              RUSSELL
                    My elbow hurts and I have to go to
                    the bathroom.

          

                              CARL
                    I asked you about that five minutes
                    ago!

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, I didn't have to go then!
          Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't want to walk anymore.     Can
                    we stop?

          

                              CARL
                    Russell! If you don't hurry up,
                    the tigers will eat you.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    There's no tigers in South America.
          Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Zoology.

                              CARL
                    Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into
                    the bushes and do your business.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Okay!   Here, hold my stuff.

          

                                                                     39.

          

          
          Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands,
          secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs.

          
          He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand
          and a pile of leaves in another.

                              RUSSELL
                    I've always wanted to try this!

          
          Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to.

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to
                    dig the hole before or after?

          

                               CARL
                    Eugh!   None of my concern!
          Beat.

          

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Oh.    It's before!

          
          Carl covers his ears.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction.

          
          He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Huh?  Tracks?!

                        (REALIZING)
                    Snipe!
          Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
                    Snipe!
          The footprints continue for a time, then stop.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Huh.
          Russell munches on a chocolate bar.

          
          Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.   He turns to look.
          Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips
          out.

          

                                                                      40.

          

          
          Russell turns.    Nothing there.

          
          Another nibble!   Zip!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Ha! Gotcha!

          
          Russell peers into the shrub.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Don't be afraid, little snipe. I
                    am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a
                    friend to all of nature. Want some
                    more?

          
          Russell holds out the chocolate.   The beak pokes out and
          nibbles.

                                RUSSELL
                    Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on
                    out.

          
          The beak zips back into the bushes.

                             RUSSELL
                    Come on. Don't be afraid little
                    snipe. Nice snipe. Good little
                    snipe. Nice...
          A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.

                              RUSSELL
                    ...giant snipe!

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING


          
          Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.    Russell and the
          massive creature step up behind him.

                              RUSSELL
                    I found the snipe!

          

                              CARL
                        (humoring him)
                    Oh, did you?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Are they tall?

          

                              CARL
                    Oh yes, they're very tall.

          

                                                                   41.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Do they have a lot of colors?

          

                              CARL
                    They do indeed.

                              RUSSELL
                    Do they like chocolate?

          

                               CARL
                    Oh ye-   Chocolate?

          
          Carl turns to look.
          Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD.

          
          Carl SCREAMS.

                              CARL
                    What is that thing?!

                              RUSSELL
                    It's a snipe!

                              CARL
                    There's no such thing as a snipe!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But you said snipes eat--

          
          Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird.

          
          The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.   It cradles
          Russell like a baby.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Whoah!
          Russell GIGGLES.

          
          Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.

                              CARL
                    Go on, get out of here. Go on!
                    Shoo!

          
          The bird HISSES.
          It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around
          playfully. It looks scary and fun.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Whoah! Whoah!

          

                                                                        42.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Careful, Russell!

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes
                    me!

          

                                 CARL
                    Russell!
          The bird grooms Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (LAUGHING)
                    No stop, that tickles!

          
          Carl pokes the bird with his cane.

                              CARL
                    Get out of here.    Go on, git!

          
          The bird sets Russell down.     It stalks Carl, HISSING and
          ruffling its feathers.

          

                                 CARL
                    Aaaah!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's
                    okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!

          
          Russell pats Carl on the head.

                                 CARL
                    "Kevin"?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, that's his name I just gave
                    him.

          
          The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak.

                              CARL
                    Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!

          
          Carl waves his cane.    The bird eats it.

                               CARL
                    Hey!   That's mine!

          
          The bird chokes and the cane comes back up.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          

                               CARL
                    Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.

          
          Carl shoos the bird away.     The bird mimics him.

          

                              CARL
                    Go on, beat it.

          
          GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air.

          
          The bird mimics this as well.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Can we keep him? Please?? I'll
                    get the food for him, I'll walk
                    him, I'll change his newspapers...

          

                                 CARL
                    No.

          

                              RUSSELL

                        (RECITING)
                    "An Explorer is a friend to all, be
                    it plants or fish or tiny mole."

          

                              CARL
                    That doesn't even rhyme.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah it does.
          Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Hey, look!     Kevin!

          

                              CARL
                    What? Get down! You're not
                    allowed up there!

          
          The bird is on Carl's roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS.
          The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES.

                              CARL
                    You come down here right now!

          
          The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell.

                               CARL
                    Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Ellie?
                        (gets idea)

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  44.
                              RUSSELL (cont'd)
                    Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the
                    bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                        (to Carl)
                    She said for you to let me.

          

                              CARL
                        (to Ellie)
                    But I told him no --
                        (catches himself)
                    I told you no! N-O.
          The bird HISSES at Carl.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY


          
          Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist.
          Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail.

          
          The bird follows, eating.

          

                              CARL
                    I see you back there!

          
          It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible.

          

                              CARL
                    Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go
                    annoy someone else for a while.

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey, are you okay over there?
          The bird dashes away.

          

                                 CARL
                    Uh, hello?

          
          Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet
          away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN.

                               CARL
                    Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.

          
          Carl walks toward the man.

                              CARL
                    It's nice to know someone else is
                    up here!

          

                              VOICE
                    I can smell you.

          Carl stops.

          

                                CARL
                    What?    You can smell us?

          

                              VOICE
                    I can smell you.

          
          As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK.

          

                                CARL
                    Hey.

          
          Russell GIGGLES.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You were talking to a rock.
          Russell points to another rock shape.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, that one looks like a turtle!

          
          Sure enough.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Look at that one!     That one looks
                    like a dog!
          The "rock" walks forward.

                              RUSSELL
                    It is a dog!

                                CARL
                    What?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs
                    in my apartment.
          The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, I like dogs!

          

                              CARL
                        (calls out)
                    We have your dog!
                        (to self)
                    Wonder who he belongs to?

                                RUSSELL
                    Sit boy.

          

                                                                 46.

          

          
          The dog sits.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!

          
          The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Uh-huh.    Speak.

          

                                DUG
                    Hi there.

          
          Carl and Russell freeze.

          

                              CARL
                    Did that dog just say "Hi there?"

                                DUG
                    Oh yes.
          Carl JUMPS back.

          

                              DUG
                    My name is Dug. I have just met
                    you and I love you.

          
          Dug jumps up on to Carl.

                                CARL
                    Uh..wha?

          
          Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of
          it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately,
          it talks non-stop.

          

                              DUG
                    My master made me this collar. He
                    is a good and smart master and he
                    made me this collar so that I may
                    talk -- SQUIRREL!!
          Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm.

          

                              DUG
                    My master is good and smart.

                              CARL
                    It's not possible.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh it is, because my master is
                    smart.

          

                                                             47.

          

          

                                 RUSSELL
                       Cool! What do these do, boy?

          
          He inspects the collar and twists a dial.

          

                                 DUG
                       Hey would you-

                           (CLICK)
                       -cuerdo con tigo-

                           (CLICK)
                       I use that collar-

                           (CLICK)
                       -watashi wa hanashi ma-

                           (CLICK)
                       -to talk with, I would be happy if
                       you stopped.

          

                                 CARL
                       Russell, don't touch that. It could
                       be radioactive or something.
          Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.

          

                                 DUG
                       I am a great tracker. My pack sent
                       me on a special mission all by
                       myself. Have you seen a bird? I
                       want to find one and I have been on
                       the scent. I am a great tracker,
                       did I mention that?
          BAM!   The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.

          

                                 DUG
                       Hey, that is the bird! I have
                       never seen one up close but this is
                       the bird.
                           (to Carl)
                       May I take your bird back to camp
                       as my prisoner?

          

                                 CARL
                       Yes! Take it! And on the way,
                       learn how to bark like a real dog!

          

                                 DUG
                       Oh I can bark!
          Dug BARKS.

          

                                 DUG
                       And here's howling!
          Dug HOWLS.    The bird HISSES at Dug.

          

                                                                    48.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Can we keep him? Please please
                    please?

          

                                CARL
                    No.

          
          Russell falls to his knees, pleading.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But it's a talking dog!

          

                              CARL
                    It's just a weird trick or
                    something. Let's get to the falls.

          
          Carl grabs Russell.   The bird follows, as does Dug.

                              DUG
                    Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh
                    please be my prisoner.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY


          
          Footprints.   A dog's nose follows the tracks.   This is GAMMA,
          a bulldog.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Oh, here it is.    I picked up the
                    bird's scent!

          
          A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler.

                               BETA
                    Wait a minute, wait a minute! What
                    is this? Chocolate. I smell
                    chocolate.

          

                              GAMMA
                    I'm getting prunes and denture
                    cream! Who are they?

                              BETA
                    Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
                    We'd better tell him someone took
                    the bird, right Alpha?
          ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    No. Soon enough the bird will be
                    ours yet again.

          

                                                                       49.

          

          
          Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in
          helium.

          

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    Find the scent, my compadres and
                    you two shall have much rewardings
                    from Master for the toil factor you
                    wage.

          
          Beta and Gamma look at each other.

                              BETA
                    Hey Alpha, I think there's
                    something wrong with your collar.
                    You must have bumped it.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
          Beta and Gamma LAUGH.   Alpha turns.   They stop laughing.

                              ALPHA
                    Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire
                    to -- SQUIRREL!

          
          All three dogs look for the squirrel.   False alarm.

          

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    Mayhaps you desire to challenge the
                    ranking that I have been assigned
                    by my strength and cunning?

          

                              BETA
                    No no. But maybe Dug would.     You
                    might want to ask him.

          
          Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively.

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, I wonder if he's found the
                    bird on his very special mission.

                              ALPHA
                    Do not mention Dug to me at this
                    time. His fool's errand will keep
                    him most occupied, most occupied
                    indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not
                    agree with that which I am saying
                    to you now?

          

                              BETA
                    Sure, but the second Master finds
                    out you sent Dug out by himself,
                    none of us will get a treat.

          

                                                                     50.

          

          

                              ALPHA
                    You are wise, my trusted
                    Lieutenant.

          
          Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar.

                              ALPHA (CONT'D)
                    This is Alpha calling Dug.   Come
                    in, Dug.

          
          The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's
          collar.

          

                                DUG
                    Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds
                    funny.

          

                              ALPHA
                    I know, I know!   Have you seen the
                    bird?

                              DUG
                    Why yes, the bird is my prisoner
                    now.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, right.

          
          The screen view adjusts to see the bird.   It hisses.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Impossible! Where are you?!

          

                              DUG
                    I am here with the bird and I will
                    bring it back and then you will
                    like me. Oh, gotta go.
          On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a
          boy's face. It's Russell.

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (on video screen)
                    Hey Dug! Who you talking to?

          
          The video screen goes blank.   The dogs BARK excitedly.

                              BETA
                    What's Dug doing?

          

                              GAMMA
                    Why's he with that small mailman?

          

                                                                    51.

          

          

                              BETA
                    Where are they?

          
          Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.    A TRACKING DEVICE
          locates Dug.

                              ALPHA
                    There he is. Come on!

          
          The dogs sprint off into the jungle.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY

          The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
                    prisoner!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

          

                              DUG
                    That man there says I can take the
                    bird and I love that man there like
                    he is my master.

          
          The bird HISSES.

          

                              CARL
                    I am not your master!

          
          The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.   Dug jumps up on it.

          

                              DUG
                    I am warning you, once again, bird!

                                 RUSSELL
                    Hey!     Quit it!

          

                              DUG
                    I am jumping on you now, bird.

          
          Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether.

          

                              CARL
                    Russell! At this rate we'll never
                    get to the falls!

          
          Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.   Carl falls,
          pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH!
          Carl GASPS.   He turns his anger to the group.

          

                                                                   52.

          

          

                              CARL
                    I am nobody's master, got it?
                        (points to bird)
                    I don't want you here,
                        (points to Dug)
                    ...and I don't want you here.
                        (points to Russell)
                    I'm stuck with you. And if you two
                    don't clear out of here by the time
                    I count to three-
          Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.

          

                               DUG
                    A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball!

          

                               CARL
                    Ball?
          Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.

          

                              CARL
                    You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?

                              DUG
                    Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so
                    want the ball!

          

                              CARL
                    Go get it!!
          Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and
                    then bring it back!

          

                              CARL

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Why?

          

                              CARL
                    Just give it to me!
          Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.

          

                               CARL
                    Bird.   Bird!
          Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.

          

                                                                        53.

          

          
          Carl grabs Russell and runs.

          

                              CARL
                    C'mon Russell!

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE

          Carl pulls them down a slope.     He slips.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN TREETOPS


          
          Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree.

                                 CARL
                    Daah!

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM

          Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks.        Carl
          slips and his foot goes into the water.

          

                                 CARL
                    Aaahh...

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE


          

                              RUSSELL
                    What are we doing?

          
          Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves.      BUGS buzz around him.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN STEEP HILLSIDE


          
          Carl climbs up the hill.      He FALLS over a dead branch.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.
                    Kevin's gonna miss me.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS


          
          They climb over a ridge.      Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight.
          Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD.

          

                                                                         54.

          

          

                                CARL
                      I think that did the trick.

          
          He turns.   Dug.     With the ball in his mouth.

          

                                DUG
                      Hi, Master.

          

                                   CARL
                      Afternoon.
          Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.

          
          Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - NIGHT

          A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring
          down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept
          dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.

          
          Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.        He
          rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.

          

                                CARL
                      Well, thanks for keeping us dry
                      anyway, Ellie.

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                      Which one's the front?

          
          Russell struggles to set up the tent.       He reads his manual.

                                RUSSELL
                      Is this step three, or step five?
          Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      There!
          Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into
          place.

          
          Carl can't watch.
          An off screen SMACK!      Russell walks to Carl.   Miraculously,
          he looks unscathed.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      All done.
          Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                        (pointing to tent)
                    That's for you!

          
          The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the
          cliff.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Awh.   Tents are hard.

          

                              CARL
                    Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness
                    Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, but... can I tell you a
                    secret?

                               CARL
                    No.

                              RUSSELL
                    Alright, here goes. I never
                    actually built a tent before.
                    There. I said it.

                              CARL
                    You've been camping before, haven't
                    you?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, never outside.

          

                              CARL
                    Well, why didn't you ask your Dad
                    how to build a tent?

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't think he wants to talk
                    about this stuff.

          

                              CARL
                    Why don't you try him sometime?
                    Maybe he'll surprise you.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see
                    him much.

          

                              CARL
                    He's got to be home sometime.

          

                                                                   56.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Well, I called, but Phyllis told me
                    I bug him too much.

          

                              CARL
                    Phyllis? You call your own mother
                    by her first name?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Phyllis isn't my mom.
          Carl realizes he put his foot in it.

          

                               CARL
                    Oh.

          
          The two sit silently together, watching the fire.

                              RUSSELL
                    But he promised he'd come to my
                    Explorer ceremony to pin on my
                    Assisting the Elderly badge, so he
                    can show me about tents then,
                    right?

          
          Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.   He looks at the missing
          badge on Russell's sash.

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, uh, why don't you get some
                    sleep. Don't want to wake up the
                    traveling flea circus.

          
          Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants
                    to take Kevin prisoner. We have to
                    protect him!

          
          Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    Can Kevin go with us?

          

                               CARL
                    Alright.   He can come.

                              RUSSELL
                    Promise you won't leave him?

          

                               CARL
                    Yeah.

          

                                                                    57.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Cross your heart?

          
          Carl looks down at Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    Cross my heart.

          
          Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.    He shakes his
          head and looks up at the house.

                              CARL
                    What have I got myself into, Ellie?

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING

          A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand
          smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away.

          
          Carl rises, looking up at the house.

                              CARL
                    Morning Sweetheart.

          
          The balloons on the house are wilting.

                              CARL
                    We better get moving.

          
          He scans the camp.   The bird is gone.

                              CARL
                    Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell
                    won't notice.
                        (calls out)
                    Alright, everybody up!

          
          Russell sits up with a SNORT.

                              RUSSELL
                    Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
                    Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

          
          Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.

                              DUG
                    Find the bird.    Find the bird...

                    POINT!
          Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.

          

                                                                   58.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Oh, look! There he is.

          
          Russell points to the right.   The bird is on top of Carl's
          house.
          Dug turns around.

          

                              DUG

                    POINT!
          The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.

          

                              CARL
                    Hey, that's my food!   Get off my
                    roof!

          

                              DUG
                    Yeah, get off of his <>!

          
          In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out.   The bird CALLS back.

          

                              CARL
                    What is it doing?

          

                              DUG
                    The bird is calling to her babies.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
          The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.

          

                              DUG
                    Her house is over there in those
                    twisty rocks.
          Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.   The
          baby birds call from somewhere inside.

          

                              DUG
                    She has been gathering food for her
                    babies and must get back to them.

          
          The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head
          with her beak. She HISSES at Dug.

                              RUSSELL
                    Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
                    you promised to protect her!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Her babies need her, we gotta make
                    sure they're together.

          

                                                                   59.

          

          
          The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth.   Carl gathers up
          the hose tether.

          

                              CARL
                    Sorry Russell. We've lost enough
                    time already.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Yeah...

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes
          ahead. She scampers back toward the house.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA

          Russell chews on some chocolate.

                              RUSSELL
                    This was her favorite chocolate.
                    Because you sent her away, there's
                    more for you.
          Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.

          
          They hear rustling from the bushes behind them.

          

                                 CARL
                    Huh?

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Kevin?

          
          Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously
          barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.

          
          Dug is conflicted.

          
          Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl.
          He turns toward Dug.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    Where's the bird? You said you had
                    the bird.

          

                              DUG
                    Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have
                    said that, I can see how you would
                    think that.

          

                                                                      60.

          

          

                              ALPHA
                    Where is it?

          

                              DUG
                    Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow
                    and then I will again have the
                    bird. Yes.

          
          Alpha BARKS angrily.

          

                              ALPHA
                    You lost it. Why do I not have a
                    surprised feeling? Well, at least
                    you now have lead us to the small
                    mailman and The One Who Smells of
                    Prunes.

          
          Carl and Russell look at Dug.    He turned on them!   Dug
          shamefully lowers his head.

          

                              ALPHA
                    Master will be most pleased we have
                    found them, and will ask of them
                    many questions.
                        (commanding, to Carl)
                    Come!

          

                              CARL
                    Wait, we're not going with you.
                    We're going to the falls!
          Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.

          

                              CARL
                    Get away from me! Get down!

          
          The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.    Dug follows.
          The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD.

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY

          Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.

          
          Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls.
          Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch
          warily and continue their march.

          
          They round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.

          

                                                                      61.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE


          
          The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group
          approaches the huge cave opening.

          
          DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop.
          More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there
          are more dogs!

          
          Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell.
          Closer... closer...

          
          From the darkness a voice:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Stay!

          
          The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It
          examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.

          

                              VOICE
                    You came here in that?

          

                              CARL
                    Uh... yeah.

                              VOICE
                    In a house? A floating house?
          The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.

                               VOICE
                    That is the darndest thing I've
                    ever seen! You're not after my
                    bird, are you? But if you need to
                    borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy
                    to oblige!
          The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.

          

                              VOICE
                    Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
                    My dogs made a mistake.

          
          The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.   Carl
          recognizes him!

                              CARL
                    Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well... Yes.

          

                                                                    62.

          

          

                              CARL
                    The Charles Muntz?

          
          Muntz gives him the "thumbs up."

          

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          
          Carl GIGGLES with glee.

          

                              CARL
                    It's really him!
                        (to Russell)
                    That's Charles Muntz!

                              RUSSELL

                        (EXCITED)
                    It is?!?

                        (CONSIDERS)
                    Who's Charles Muntz?

          

                                CARL
                    Him!

          

                                DOG WALLA
                    Yes!    It is him! He is!

                              CARL
                    I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
                    I, we were your biggest fans!

          
          Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.    Muntz is charmed.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, you're a man of good taste!

          
          Muntz LAUGHS at his joke.    Carl joins in.

                              MUNTZ
                    You must be tired.     Hungry?

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Uh-huh.

                              MUNTZ
                        (to dogs)
                    Attention everyone! These people
                    are no longer intruders. They are
                    our guests.

          
          The dogs CHEER.

          

                                                                  63.

          

          

                              DOG WALLA
                    Follow me! I like you temporarily.
                    You do smell like prunes. I will
                    not bite you.

          
          Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow.

          

          INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                CARL
                    Wow.

          
          Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the
          "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.

          

                              MUNTZ (O.S.)
                    I'm sorry about the dogs -- hope
                    they weren't too rough on you.

          

                              GAMMA (O.S.)
                    We weren't!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Go ahead and moor your airship
                    right next to mine.

          
          Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house.
          Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible.

          

                              CARL
                    We're not actually going inside the
                    "Spirit of Adventure" itself?!

                                MUNTZ
                    Oh.    Would you like to?

                              CARL
                    Would I?!?!

          
          Carl GIGGLES like a little boy.

                              CARL
                    Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

          
          Carl and Russell follow up the ramp.

                              CARL
                    Jiminy Cricket.

          
          Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta.

                                BETA
                    Not you.

          

                                                                      64.

          

          

                              GAMMA
                    What do we do with Dug?

          

                              ALPHA
                    He has lost the bird.     Put him in
                    the Cone of Shame.

          
          Dug WHIMPERS.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE GANGPLANK - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible.   Dug sits
          forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck.

          

                              DUG
                    I do not like the Cone of Shame.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - TROPHY ROOM

          Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room.
          It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures,
          and rare cultural artifacts.

          
          Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and
          Russell through the room.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Most of the collection is housed in
                    the world's top museums: New York,
                    Munich, London... `Course I kept
                    the best for myself.

                              CARL
                    Did you ever! Will you look at that?

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast
                    charged while I was brushing my
                    teeth. Used my shaving kit to
                    bring him down.
          A dog approaches carrying a menu.    Muntz waves it off.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, surprise me.
                        (to Carl)
                    Only way to get it out of Ethiopia
                    at the time was to have it declared
                    as "dental equipment!"
          Muntz LAUGHS.   Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one
          of the bones.

          

                                                                  65.

          

          

                              CARL
                    Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian
                    Leopard Tortoise!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, you recognize it? I'm
                    impressed! That's an interesting
                    story there...

          
          A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth.
          Muntz glances at the bottle.

          

                               MUNTZ
                    Hm, excellent choice.
                        (to Carl)
                    I found it on safari with
                    Roosevelt.
          Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
          POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.

                              MUNTZ
                    He and I fell into a habit of
                    playing gin rummy in the evenings.
                    And did he cheat? Oh, he was
                    horrible!

          
          Muntz and Carl LAUGH.   Alpha interrupts.

                              ALPHA
                        (high-pitched voice)
                    Master, dinner is ready.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh dear, broken translator.   It's
                    that loose wire again.
                        (leans down, fixes it)
                    There you go big fella.

          

                              ALPHA
                        (deep scary voice)
                    Thank you Master.
          Russell reacts.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I liked his other voice.
          Muntz LAUGHS.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Well, dinner is served!    Right this
                    way.

          

                                                                    66.

          

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM


          
          Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a
          large table.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    So how are things stateside?
                    Almost tempted to go back a few
                    times, but I have unfinished work
                    here... Please.
          Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place
          napkins on their laps.

                              MUNTZ
                    I hope you're hungry because
                    Epsilon is the finest chef I've
                    ever had.
          Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove
          the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look
          delicious.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

                              RUSSELL
                    Yes!!
          Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and
          eats a bite.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey!

          
          Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his
          glass.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey!

          
          Carl looks around, still enthralled.

                              CARL
                    Oh my Ellie would have loved all
                    this. You know, it's because of
                    you she had this dream to come down
                    here and live by Paradise Falls.

          
          He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole
          window.

          

                                                                    67.

          

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I'm honored. And now you've made
                    it!

          

                              CARL
                    You're sure we're not a bother?
                    I'd hate to impose.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    No no! It's a pleasure to have
                    guests -- a real treat.

          
          The dogs erupt into excited barking.

                               DOG WALLA
                    Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm
                    down...
          In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Hey!

                              MUNTZ

                        (CONT'D)
                    Shouldn't've used that word...
                    Having guests is a delight. More
                    often I get thieves, come to steal
                    what's rightfully mine.

                               CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.

                              MUNTZ
                    They called me a fraud, those...
                    dah! But once I bring back this
                    creature, my name will be cleared.
          The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,
          feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.

          
          This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size
          skeleton.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a
                    lifetime tracking it. Sometimes
                    years go by between sightings...

          

                               (MORE)

          

                                                                   68.
                              MUNTZ (cont'd)
                    I've tried to smoke it out of that
                    deathly labyrinth where it lives...
                    Can't go in after it. Once in,
                    there's no way out. Lost so many
                    dogs...
          Muntz is lost in reverie.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    And here they come, these bandits,
                    and think the bird is theirs to
                    take! But they soon find that this
                    mountain is a very dangerous
                    place.

          
          Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, that looks like Kevin!

          

                                 MUNTZ
                    "Kevin?"

          

                             RUSSELL
                    Yeah! That's my new giant bird
                    pet. I trained it to follow us.

          
          Muntz and Alpha exchange glances.

                              MUNTZ
                    Follow you? Impossible.      How?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    She likes chocolate.

          
          Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz.

                                 MUNTZ
                    Chocolate?

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Yeah, I gave her some of my
                    chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.

          
          Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it.

          

                              CARL
                    But it ran off!      It's gone now.

          
          Muntz stares.

          
          He walks to a table full of flight helmets.

          

                                                                   69.

          

          

                              MUNTZ
                    You know, Carl. These people who
                    pass through here, they all tell
                    pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"
                    making a map.
          Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.   It
          rolls across the floor.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.

          
          Muntz topples another helmet.
          He lifts a third to show Carl.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    An old man taking his house to
                    Paradise Falls.

          
          He drops the helmet.   It rolls to Carl's feet.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    That's the best one yet. I can't
                    wait to hear how it ends.
          Carl glances around nervously.

          
          Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE

          BIRD!

                              CARL
                    Well! It's been a wonderful
                    evening, but we'd better be going.

          
          Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.

                              MUNTZ
                    Oh, you're not leaving?

          

                              CARL
                    We don't want to take advantage of
                    your hospitality. Come on Russell.

          
          Carl leads Russell toward the door.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    But we haven't even had dessert
                    yet.

          
          Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.

          

                                                                          70.

          

          

                                MUNTZ
                      No, the boy's right. You haven't
                      had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
                      delicious Cherries Jubilee.

          
          Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like
          something out of a bad dream.

          

                                MUNTZ
                      Oh, you really must stay. I
                      insist! We have so much more to
                      talk about!

          
          A distant HAUNTED WAIL.         Everyone stops.

          

                                   RUSSELL
                      Kevin?
          Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he
          sees THE BIRD.

                                   MUNTZ
                      It's here.
          He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

                                MUNTZ
                          (to dogs)
                      Get them!

          

          INT. CAVE


          
          Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.

          

                                   CARL
                      Hurry!

                                RUSSELL
                      I am hurrying!

          
          Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.

                               RUSSELL
                      They're coming!

          
          Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.
          Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short.

          

                                DUG (O.S.)
                      Master, over here!

          

                                                                         71.

          

          
          Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl
          and Russell run toward him.

          
          The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting
          closer.
          There's no choice but to JUMP.

          
          The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell
          to leap down the incline, like astronauts.

                              DUG
                    Go toward the light, master!
          Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

          
          The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts
          Carl and Russell on her back.
          She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
          Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.

          
          BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the
          ceiling. The house lowers.

          
          Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the
          house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto
          the ground.

                                 CARL
                    Russell!

          
          Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.
          Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.

          

                                 CARL
                    Get back!!
          Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
          down! The dogs stop short.

          
          Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the
          canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!

          

                              DUG
                    Go on Master!       I will stop the
                    dogs!
          Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

          

                                                                        72.

          

          

                               DUG
                    Stop you dogs!!

          
          The dogs run around Dug.

          
          Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.

          
          The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She
          rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.

          
          The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back
          and forth wildly in the air.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Help! Help!

          
          Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

                              CARL
                    Gimme your hand!
          Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
          PULLS him back onto the bird.
          Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
          to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds
          100 feet below.

          
          Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Hang on to Kevin!

          
          Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.

          
          Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries
          them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
          is kicked loose and falls into the river below.

          
          Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs
          are stuck on the other side.
          Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's
          still intact.

          
          He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Kevin!

          
          The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back
          to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.

          

                                                                     73.

          

          
          The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She
          can't stand.

          
          Russell applies a bandage.

          
          From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
          Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.

          
          Russell runs to her side.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
                        (to Carl)
                    She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
                    her get home?

          
          Carl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze,
          then to his house.
          He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it.

                               CARL
                    Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.

                              MUNTZ
                    You lost them?

          

                              BETA
                    Uh, it was Dug.

          

                              GAMMA
                    Yeah, he's with them.    He helped
                    them escape!

          
          Muntz snarls in anger.

          

                               MUNTZ
                    Wait.   Wait a minute.   Dug...

          
          He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.

          

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS


          
          DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on
          Dug's location.

          

                                                                     74.

          

          
          Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.

          
          Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.

          

                              CARL
                    See anything?

          

                              DUG
                    No, my pack is not following us!
                    Boy they are dumb.
          Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
          from behind a tree canopy.

                              CARL
                    This is crazy. I finally meet my
                    childhood hero and he's trying to
                    kill us! What a joke.

                              DUG
                    Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
                    walks up to a tree and says I
                    forgot to store acorns for winter
                    and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
                    because the squirrel gets dead.
          They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

          

                              CARL
                    Careful Russell.
          The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
          porch.

                              RUSSELL
                    You okay, Kevin?
          Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
                    The wilderness isn't quite what I
                    expected.

          

                               CARL
                    Yeah?   How so?

                              RUSSELL
                    It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
                    not how they made it sound in my
                    book.

                              CARL
                    Hmm, get used to that, kid.

          

                                                                    75.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    My dad made it sound so easy. He's
                    really good at camping, and how to
                    make fire from rocks and stuff. He
                    used to come to all my Sweatlodge
                    meetings.

          
          Russell smiles at the thought.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    And afterwards we'd go get ice
                    cream at Fentons. I always get
                    chocolate and he gets butter-
                    brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
                    curb, right outside, and I'll count
                    all the blue cars and he counts all
                    the red ones, and whoever gets the
                    most, wins. I like that curb.
          He looks up at Carl.

                              RUSSELL
                    That might sound boring, but I
                    think the boring stuff is the stuff
                    I remember the most.
          They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

          
          The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.    Kevin CALLS BACK.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Look, there it is!

          
          Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.   He tries to run
          but is pulled back by his tether.

          
          LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.

                              CARL
                    Hold on Russell, stand still!

          
          Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
          Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward
          the labyrinth entrance.

          
          Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.   She runs
          off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

          

                              CARL
                    Look at that bird go!

                              CARL
                    Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

          

                                                                      76.

          

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your
                    babies!

          
          Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce
          spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Run Kevin! Run!

          
          A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Oh no!

          
          The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.

          

                              CARL
                    Russell, give me your knife!

          
          Carl saws frantically at the net.

          

                              MUNTZ (O.S.)
                    Get away from my bird!

          
          Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them,
          a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.

          
          Muntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house.

          
          Heat waves ripple up.   Balloons POP.    Carl's house LOWERS
          into the fire.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                CARL
                    No!

          
          Carl panics.    He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.

          
          Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking
          him down and grabbing the bird in the net.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    No!
          Carl pulls his house away from the flames.

          

                                                                     77.

          

          
          The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the
          dirigible.

          
          Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Careful. We want her in good shape
                    for my return.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    Let her go! Stop!

          
          Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
          The dirigible flies off.

          

                               RUSSELL
                    Kevin!
          Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes
          the flames.

          
          Carl collapses on the side of his house.

                              RUSSELL
                    You gave away Kevin.   You just gave
                    her away.

          

                              CARL
                    This is none of my concern.      I
                    didn't ask for any of this!

          

                               DUG
                    Master.   It's alright.

          

                              CARL
                    I am not your master! And if you
                    hadn't a shown up, none of this
                    would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
                    dog!

          
          Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
          Carl angrily puts on the harness.

          

                              CARL
                    Now, whether you assist me or not,
                    I am going to Paradise Falls if it
                    kills me.

          
          He walks off.   Russell falls in behind.
          An angry dawn breaks.

          

                                                                    78.

          

          

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY


          
          Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky
          landscape.

          
          Russell's harness drags along side, empty.

          
          Russell walks behind.

          

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING


          
          With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.
          The house groans as it comes to rest.

          
          Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING


          
          He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls.
          Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.

          
          Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.    Next to him stands
          the real house, just like Ellie wanted.

                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
                    Here.
          Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.

                              RUSSELL
                    I don't want this anymore.
          Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone.

          
          Carl picks up the sash.   He walks up the steps of his house.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          The door opens. Carl steps in.   He's back in his house for
          the first time in days.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess
          from the rough journey.

          
          Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the
          table into position.
          He pushes their two chairs back into their place.

          

                                                                   79.

          

          
          Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.

          
          Quiet.

          
          Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.
          Carl surveys the room.

          
          The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.   He opens it
          and puts Ellie's drawing back.
          He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper
          clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
          He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.

          
          Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but
          Ellie never made it.
          He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he
          hadn't before.

          
          The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
          A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
          On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...
          photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
          Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw
          adventure in everyday life.

          
          A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in
          their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:

          

             "THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!

             LOVE, ELLIE."
          Carl smiles.

          
          He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.   On the arm is
          Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.
          He looks to Ellie's chair.

          
          He crosses his heart.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


          
          Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.

                                CARL
                    Russell?

          

                                                                     80.

          

          
          But Russell is nowhere to be seen.

          
          A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating
          off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.

          

                               CARL
                    Russell!

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
                    won't!

          
          Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into
          the sky.

          

                              CARL
                    No, Russell! No!
          Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
          it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
          have lost too much helium.

          
          Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.    It lands atop the
          mountain rocks with a thud.

          
          This gives him an idea.

          

                                                              CUT TO:
          The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
          dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

          
          Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.   Then another.
          Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.    It
          teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!

                               CARL
                    Wahhoo!

          
          The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of
          things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side
          atop Paradise Falls.

          Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies.

          KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.    Carl's eyes go wide.

          

                                 CARL
                    Russell?

                    Dug!

          

                              DUG
                    I was hiding under your porch
                    because I love you. Can I stay?

          

                              CARL
                    Can you stay? Well, you're my dog
                    aren't you? And I'm your master!

                              DUG
                    You are my master?!
          Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.

                                 DUG
                    Oh boy.     Oh boy!

          The house flies off into the sky.

                              CARL (O.S.)
                    Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy!

          Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the
          leaf blower. They turn to look.

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.    He
          smashes into the wall.

          

                                                                     82.

          

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Ooph!

          
          He tries again and TUMBLES through the window.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower,
          ready for action.

                                RUSSELL
                    Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -
          Growling dogs move toward him.

          
          Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM

          Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.     She's
          miserable and scared.

                              MUNTZ
                    And they wouldn't believe me. Just
                    wait till they get a look at you.

          INT. DIRIGIBLE


          
          Dogs tie Russell to a chair.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Let me go!

          
          Muntz enters.

                              MUNTZ
                    Where's your elderly friend?

          
          Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face.

                              RUSSELL
                    He's not my friend anymore.

          Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the
          porthole. Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.
                    Guard that bird. If you see the
                    old man, you know what to do.

          
          Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room.

                              RUSSELL
                    Hey, where are you going?    I'm not

          Muntz slams the door.
          Light emerges from the floor.    Russell is on the ramp, which
          is opening. Russell REACTS.

          

                                                                    84.

          Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell's sash, then
          hooks his cane onto his back. He's fighting for a cause.
          He hears SCREAMING. It's Russell! Tied to his chair, he
          slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the
          edge.

          

                               CARL

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP - CONTINUOUS

          Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using
          his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him
          just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely
          together.

          Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to
          the dirigible ramp.

          
          Carl carries Russell into the house.

                    safe!
          Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.

          Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end
          of Carl's cane.

          Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.      He
          bangs his cane. All the dogs turn.
          He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air.

          The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit.

          

                              DOGS
                    I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna
                    get the ball! I'm gonna get it!

                    I got it!!

          
          Behind them Carl shuts the door.    The dogs realize their
          mistake.

                                 GAMMA
                    Uh-oh.

                    I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out

          Muntz scans the horizon.    Suddenly the in-ship communicator
          comes to life.

          Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair.

          

                              RUSSELL
                    I want to help!
          He manages to get his arms free.

          

                                RUSSELL
                    Ha ha!

          
          Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on
          the porch and fall off.

          
          Russell SCREAMS as he falls.     The hose unspools.

          
          Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it
          and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down.

          
          The house drifts away from the dirigible.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues.

                    Does anyone know where they are?!?!

          
          On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the
          control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose.
          Muntz stares, slack-jawed.

                                 RUSSELL
                    Whoooaaah!

          
          The house floats off.

          Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind.

          
          What's that noise?   From beneath the dirigible emerges...

          Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room.

                      Come on, Kevin.

          
          Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them.       He grabs a sword
          from the wall display and attacks.
          Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg.

          
          Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door.    He slams it shut.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, OUTSIDE OF TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks.

          
          He hears growling and turns around.    There stands Alpha and
          the other dogs.

                                 DUG
                      Hi.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY

          Dug runs.   The dogs give chase.

          

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

          Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses.    Carl uses his
          cane to defend himself.

          

          OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!
          Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
          His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
          Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis
          balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.

          
          Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his
          head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He's stuck! Carl
          raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too.

          
          Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free
          and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy.
          He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and
          lifts his sword.

          

                                MUNTZ
                      Any last words, Fredricksen?   Come
                      on, spit it out!
          Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.    He falls backwards.

          

                                                                        90.

                    Come on!

          
          Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird.

          
          Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything
          that gets in his way.

          

                              MUNTZ
                    Enough! I'm taking that bird back
                    with me alive or dead!
          Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal
          the final blow.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.        He bumps a
          a LEVER.

          Muntz is knocked off balance.     He slides to one side.    Trophy
          cases slide after him.
          The dirigible tilts to the other side.

          
          The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl!
          Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls
          through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He
          dangles out over open air.
          He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging
          beneath it.

          
          The ship corrects again.      Carl climbs back inside.
          Muntz comes at Carl.

          

                              CARL
                    Come on, Kevin!

          pushes the bird along as he goes.

          
          Muntz follows up.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT


          
          Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him
          again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a
          radar shade off the control panel.
          Alpha moves in.     Dug hides behind the steering wheel.

          

                              ALPHA
                    I will have many enjoyments for
                    what I am about to do, Dug.

          
          Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.    Dug cowers,
          but then notices the RADAR SHADE.

          
          As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head.
          Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone.
          The dogs all GASP.

                    sitting! Attack!

          
          The bump caused his collar to go funny again.    The dogs all
          howl with laughter.

          with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches
          on to a rung of the ladder.

          
          He watches Carl and the bird climb.

          The house slows and lowers atop the airship.    Carl HOISTS the
          bird up onto the porch.

                     Come on, Kevin!
          Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself...

          
          BLAM!   Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle!

          
          A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of
          them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing
          onto the dirigible.

          

                                                                     94.

          

          
          Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship.

          
          The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin
          still inside.

          

                                 CARL
                      No!

          
          Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding
          house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin.
          Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to
          stop it.

          
          The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin.

          

                                CARL
                     Russell!   Get out of there!
          Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.

          
          BLAM!   A bullet smashes the door jam next to them.

          
          Muntz storms toward the house.    Carl holds desperately to the
          hose.

          

                                 CARL
                     No!    Leave them alone!

          
          Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.

          
          The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second.   Carl
          holds on for his life.

          
          Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle.

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY

          Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door.

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP

          The house slides farther over the edge.

          
          Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free
          from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it's
          about to go!

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE

          Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room.

          

                                                                    95.

          Muntz KICKS the door.

          
          Suddenly, Carl has an idea.

                                CARL
                      Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't
                      let go of her!

          

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

          Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions.   He Dug and the
          bird huddle together.

          
          Muntz breaks through the door.    He lifts his rifle and sights
          the bird...
          Through the window, Carl yells out.

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP


                                 CARL
                      Kevin!   Chocolate!

          
          Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate.

          

          INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM


          
          Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from
          his hands.

          
          Muntz lunges after them.

          

          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          
          The hose caddy breaks free.
          Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from
          her side.

          
          Muntz leaps after them.
          But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.

          
          Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the
          ground....
          He falls.

          

                                                                       96.

          

          

          

          EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP


          
          PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose.   He PULLS himself
          toward the edge.

          
          The hose curves beneath the tail fin.    Finally it swings
          out...

          

                              RUSSELL
                    That was cool!
          Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird
          holds on to the hose with her beak.
          Carl LAUGHS, relieved.

          

                              CARL
                    Don't jerk around so much, kid!
          Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.

                              DUG
                    Oh I am ready to not be up high.
          Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
          Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats
          softly down into the clouds, and disappears.

                              RUSSELL
                    Sorry about your house, Mr.
                    Fredricksen.

          
          Carl smiles.   He puts his arm around Russell.

          

                              CARL
                    You know, it's just a house.
          Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship
          floating off over the clouds.

          Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.     The babies
          peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

          

                              CARL
                    Ow! Ow! Ow!

                              RUSSELL
                    Look at you. You're so soft.

          Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the
          LABYRINTH. Time to go.

          

                              CARL/RUSSELL

                              RUSSELL
                    I wish I could keep one.

          
          The babies run to the bird.      One stops to HISS at Dug.

          
          Carl has misplaced something.

                               CARL
                    Huh, where's my cane?      I just had
                    it here...
          Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane.

          
          Babies start HACKING too.     They COUGH up tennis balls.

          

                              CARL
                    You know what? Keep `em.       A little
                    gift from me to you.
          The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.

          

                                 RUSSELL
                    Bye Kevin!
          The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
          last time before disappearing into the mist.

          

          INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT - LATER

          Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets

          Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
          Scoop it into his open chassis.
          His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
          A faded label on his corroded chest plate:
          "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
          
          Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
          Stacks it with the others.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          Something catches his eye.
          Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
          A hubcap.
          The sun reflects off it.
          Wall-E checks the sky.
          
          ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
          
          The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
          
          "...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
          
          He places the hubcap in his compactor.
          Presses a button on his chest.
          The song stops playing.
          The end of a work day.
          
          Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
          Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
          The insect hops on his shoulder.
          They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK
          
          Wall-E travels alone.
          Traverses miles of desolate waste.
          Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
          
          Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
          Buildings, highways, entire cities...
          Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
          "Buy N Large"
          "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation!
          The corporation ran every aspect of life.
          There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
          
          CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
          Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!"

          A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
          
          Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
          Practically falling apart.
          Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
          He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
          Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
          
          
          EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Wall-E now sports the newer treads.
          Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS.
          The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
          
                                                                      3.

          The holographic billboard powers off.
          Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
          The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
          Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley.
          
          ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP
          
          Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK.
          A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements.
          A "Buy N Large" logo on its side.
          Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
          
                                                                     4.

          Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls.
          KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere.
          The tired robot removes his newfound treads.
          Ahh... Home.
          
          Wall-E motors down the center aisle.
          Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER.
          Jury-rigged to an iPod.
          Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!"
          The image is very poor quality.
          Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC).
          The same song Wall-E worked to.

          Wall-E opens his cooler.
          Newfound knickknacks.
          Pulls out the hubcap from his chest.
          Looks back at the TV.
          Mimics the dancers on the screen.
          Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
          
          Continues to unpack:
          A spork.
          A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
          A Zippo Lighter.
          
          He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
          They rotate until an empty space appears.
          His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
          The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          
          A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
          Wall-E is drawn to it.
          Presses his "Record" button.
          
          ON TV SCREEN
          
          Two lovers sing gently to one another.
          They kiss...hold hands...
          
          Wall-E tilts his head as he watches.
          Curious.
          Holds his own hands.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
          Pauses to take in the night sky.
          STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
          Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
          The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
          
          The wind picks up.
          A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He looks out into the night.
          A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
          
          Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
          IOTAM still gently playing.
          
          ...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
          
          Wall-E raises the door.
          Pauses.
          WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
          The door shuts just as the storm hits.
          Obliterates everything in view.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - SAME
          
          Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter.
          Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie).
          Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in.
          It happily dives in.
          
          Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube.
          Backs into an empty shelf space.
          Rocks it like a cradle...
          ...and shuts down for the night.
          Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
          He wakes. Unboxes.
          Groggy and lifeless.
          Stumbles outside.
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
          His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
          A solar collector.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
          
          His CHARGE METER chimes full.
          Solar panels fold away into hiding.
          Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler.
          Heads off to work.
          ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach.
          Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
          
          Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread.
          The cockroach simply pops back to life.
          No biggie. Ready to go.
          Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
          
          A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
          
          - CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
            CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor.
            A cube lands by the cockroach.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
            Unsure what it's for.
            Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses.
            Tosses it in his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
            Presses the remote lock.
            Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
          
          - Plays with a paddle ball.
            The ball keeps smacking him in the face.
            He doesn't like it.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
            Throws out the ring. Keeps the case.
            The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
            ...A RUBBER DUCKY...
            ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
            ...An OLD BOOT...
            ...A TROPHY...
          
          - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
            Activates it.
            FOAM blasts in his face.
            It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
            Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself.
            Now what?
          
          - CU on fridge door.
            A WELDING BEAM moves down its center.
            It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
           The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals...
          
          ...a SMALL PLANT
          
          in its early stage of growth.
          Wall-E is entranced.
          Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
          
          CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
          
          Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
          Dusts dirt off the leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
          
          Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
          Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
          Stares at the ground.
          Continues staring.
          
          A RED DOT
          
          quivers on the dirt.
          A single laser point of light.
          Wall-E moves to touch it...
          
          ...The dot races along the ground.
          
          Wall-E drops his Igloo.
          Chases after the dot.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY BAY
          
          The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
          He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
          
          MANY LASER POINTS
          
          coming from every direction.
          All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
          Triangulating towards a center.
          
          Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
          Slowly he reaches for it.
          Can't grab it. Just light.
          ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
          The ground shakes.
          Wall-E becomes confused.
          
          Doesn't see above him.
          The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
          A noise. Building.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          
          Rocket engines.
          Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
          
          Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
          
          Wall-E runs for it.
          An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
          A second column of fire.
          A third.
          Trapped.
          
          Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
          Working fast.
          Noise deafening.
          Heat rising.
          Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
          
          ...Then suddenly quiet.
          Smoke clears.
          
          CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
          
          Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
          Glows red hot from the heat.
          Trembles with fright.
          Everything in shadow.
          Something very big looms over him.
          Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
          Bangs his head on metal.
          
          WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
          Rests ominously in the empty bay.
          
          A PORTAL on its underside opens.
          Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
          Nowhere to go.
          He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
          
          A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
          Scans the surface.
          
          Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
          The device unfolds.
          Wall-E boxes up again.
          
          A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
          ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
          Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons.
          The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
          
          ...a PROBE ROBOT.
          
          It hovers gracefully above the ground.
          White. Egg-shaped.
          
                                                              9.
          
          
          Blue-lit eyes.
          Female.
          Eve.
          
          Wall-E is transfixed.
          Inches closer.
          Watches Eve from behind the device.
          Tilts his head.
          Time stops.
          She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
          
          Eve hovers over the ground.
          A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
          Fans out 180 degrees.
          Scans random objects and areas.
          
          The device rises back into the ship.
          Exposes Wall-E.
          He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
          Never takes his eyes off Eve.
          Watches her float away from the ship.
          ...from the ship?
          The ship!
          
          Engines roar back to life.
          Wall-E digging furiously.
          The rocket takes off.
          
          Smoke clears.
          Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
          Looks for Eve.
          She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
          Waits until it is completely out of sight...
          
          ...then Eve rises high up into the air.
          
          She flies around the bay.
          Soars like a graceful bird.
          Does loops in the sky.
          Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
          He is hypnotized.
          
          Eve descends gently to the ground...
          Wall-E sneaks up closer.
          Hides behind another boulder.
          Slips.
          Makes a NOISE.
          Instantly, Eve whips around.
          Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
          Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
          
          ...Smoke clears...All quiet.
          
          Eve, now cold and dangerous.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
          Scans the area.
          No sign of life.
          All business again.
          Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
          
          ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
          
          Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock.
          Trembles uncontrollably.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
          
          Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash.
          Scans random areas.
          Wall-E spies from the shadows.
          Too frightened to approach.
          She moves on. He follows.
          
          
          EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
          
          Eve probes a mound of tires.
          Wall-E hiding nearby.
          He flinches at the sight of
          
          HIS COCKROACH
          
          innocently approaching Eve from behind.
          She spins around.
          Blasts the insect.
          Wall-E is gut-punched.
          
          The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
          Unscathed. Still curious.
          
          Eve finds the insect intriguing.
          Lowers her arm.
          The end separates into individual hovering sections...
          
          ...A HAND.
          
          She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
          Wiggles into her workings.
          It tickles.
          
                                       EVE
                          [Giggles]
          
          Wall-E relaxes.
          CHUCKLES privately.
          
          Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
          Locks onto him.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          Arm converts to laser cannon.
          Fires rapidly.
          Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts.
          Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
          
          Wall-E now exposed.
          Nowhere to hide.
          Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably.
          Eve holds her fire.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Identify yourself.]
          
          She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
          Keeps her gun trained on him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Repeat. Identify yourself.]
          
          Wall-E peeks out from his box.
          Doesn't understand a thing she says.
          Doesn't care.
          Can't believe she's real.
          The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
          Jumps onto his master.
          
          Eve scans Wall-E.
          A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
          Buzzes "negative".
          He's not what she's looking for.
          She retracts her gun arm.
          Hovers off.
          Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Sigh.]
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY
          
          LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
          
          Eve scans through the market.
          Wall-E follows from a safe distance.
          A stray puppy-dog.
          
          Eve glances over at him.
          Wall-E panics.
          Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS.
          Creates an avalanche.
          
                                                                      12.
          
          
          They chase him down a flight of stairs.
          Wall-E reaches the exit doors.
          Won't open!
          Carts pig pile on top of him.
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E perched on the roof.
          Patiently watches Eve fly.
          She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
          
          Eve comes in for a landing below.
          Shuts down for the night.
          Wall-E waits.
          Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape.
          Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground.
          Eve doesn't wake.
          Wall-E creeps up to her.
          Opens his arms wide...
          ...and measures her.
          Turns to a pile of trash.
          Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
          
                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING
          
          Eve powers up again.
          Does a double take.
          A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
          She hovers away, unimpressed.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
          Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
          They roll on top of him.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING
          
          - Scans a car engine.
            Negative.
            Slams the hood shut.
          
          - Scans a Port-A-Potty.
            Negative.
            Slams the door shut.
          
          - Scans an Apollo capsule.
            Negative.
            Slams the hatch shut.
          
          - Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD.
          
                                                              13.
          
          
           Negative.
           Slams the lid shut.
          
          
          EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK
          
          Eve hovers over the freighter.
          Frustrated.
          Not finding what she's looking for.
          Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
          
          Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
          Gets stuck.
          Wrestles to free herself.
          Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
          The reaction startles Wall-E.
          
          Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
          She gives up.
          Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
          Sits at the other end of the anchor.
          Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
          Then...
          ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
          Musters the courage to speak, when --
          She suddenly turns to him:
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [So what's your story?]
          
          Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
          Me?
          Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:
          
                                     EVE
                               (German)
                        [Directive?]
                               (Japanese)
                        [Directive?]
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Huh?]
          
                                     EVE
                               (Swahili)
                        [Directive?]
                               (English)
                        Directive?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh, I understand that!]
          
                                                          14.
          
          
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
          Scoops it into his compactor.
          Proudly spits out a cube.
          Points to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles to speak)
                        Di...rec...t--
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                       EVE
                        Classified.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh. Sorry.]
          
          She scans his CHEST LOGO.
          
                                       EVE
                        Name?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles again)
                        W-wally? ...Wall-E.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smooth; almost perfect)
                        Wwww-aaaa-leee...
          
          Wall-E nearly melts.
          She says his name so beautifully.
          Moves closer.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E.
                                 (giggles)
                        Eve.
          
          Wall-E tries to repeat it:
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeee...?
          
                                       EVE
                                 (slower)
                        Eve.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeeaaah?
          
                                     EVE
                        Eeeve. Eeeve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eee--vah!
          
          She giggles again.
          Wall-E likes making her giggle.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Eee-vah! Ee --
          
                                       EVE
                        Eve.
          
          The wind kicks up.
          The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He moves to grab her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        (Gasp!) Eee-vah!
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
          
          She draws her gun on him.
          Doesn't understand the danger.
          The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
          Too late.
          Wall-E collapses into a box.
          The storm hits full force.
          Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E? Wall-E?
          
          WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
          Calmly takes Eve's hand.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The back door lowers.
          A rush of wind and sand.
          Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door.
          She coughs up dust.
          
          Wall-E hits a switch...
          Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
          His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
          
                                                                   16.
          
          
          An air of enchantment.
          Eve is taken aback.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Come on in.]
          
          She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
          Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
          Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
          He is compelled to show her everything.
          Hands her an eggbeater...
          ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
          ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
          ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
          ...his Hello Dolly tape.
          Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud beeps)
                        [My tape!!]
          
          He grabs it back. Protective.
          Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work.
          The movie eventually appears on the TV.
          Plays a clip of POYSC.
          Wall-E is relieved.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [What do you think?]
          
          Mimics the dancing for Eve.
          Encourages her to try.
          She clumsily hops up and down.
          Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything.
          Wall-E politely stops her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [How `bout we try a different move?]
          
          Spins in a circle. Arms out.
          Eve copies.
          Spins faster, and faster...
          Too fast.
          Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves.
          
          Eve helps him up from the mess.
          Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off.
          Dangles from two wires.
          Eve GASPS with concern.
          Wall-E placates her.
          
                                                                      17.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [It's fine.]
          
          Feels his way to the rack of shelves.
          Rotates them until...
          ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear.
          Replaces his broken eye with a new one.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME.
          Wall-E freezes.
          He had no idea it could do that.
          Moves closer to inspect it...
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          It's the closest he's ever been to Eve.
          She remains focused on the lighter.
          Wall-E stares up at her.
          ...The tiny flame flickering between them...
          ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background...
          Suddenly, he is moved to express his love.
          Musters the courage to open his fingers...
          ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers...
          
          -- Eve turns and looks at him.
          
          Wall-E instantly chokes.
          Pulls his hand back.
          Eve becomes intrigued with the TV.
          Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM...
          Wall-E watches her.
          His infatuation still palpable.
          Then he remembers...
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          He rushes to his shelves.
          Eve watches him rummage through junk.
          A drum falls down on his head.
          She giggles, charmed by it all.
          Something about Wall-E...
          
          She is drawn back to the lovers on TV...
          ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand.
          A tap on her shoulder.
          She turns to find Wall-E holding something.
          
          The plant.
          
          Eve immediately locks onto it.
          
                                                                    18.
          
          
          Drops the lighter.
          In a flash...
          ...her chest opens...
          ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away...
          ...stores it inside her...
          Then she shuts down completely.
          Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest.
          
          Wall-E is stunned.
          What'd I do?
          Waves his hand in front of her face.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Knocks on her chest plate.
          No response.
          Wall-E panics.
          Gently shakes her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Still no response.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah? ...Ee-vah?!
          
          CAMERA MOVES IN on the blinking green light...
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E places Eve in his charging spot.
          Aims her hovering form to face the sun.
          Waits.
          
          MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE:
          
          - Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat.
          
          - A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon.
            Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve.
            Gets struck by lightning.
            Holds up another umbrella.
            Gets struck again.
          
          - A SANDSTORM blows through.
            Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof.
            Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve.
          
                                                               19.
          
          
          
          - Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest.
            Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY.
            Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY.
            Tries to connect the other end to hers.
            An automatic defense system blows him off truck.
          
          - Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk.
            Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
          
          - Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE.
            Uses an industrial tire as a boat.
            Rows like a gondolier with a road sign.
          
          - Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve.
            Watches the SUNSET.
            Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can.
            Tries to pull out her hand to hold it.
            It snaps back into place, trapping his hand.
          
          END OF MONTAGE
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof.
          The blank Eve floating next to him.
          Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her.
          Still no response.
          Finally, he gives up.
          
                                        WALL-E
                           [defeated sigh]
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E loads up his cooler.
          Checks on Eve one more time.
          Still nothing...
          Heads off to work, defeated.
          
          
          EXT. WORK SITE - LATER
          
          Wall-E simply going through the motions.
          No spirit in him at all.
          Stops.
          Pulls out the Zippo lighter.
          Flicks it a few times.
          A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame.
          Distant rumbling.
          Wall-E looks in the direction of his home.
          A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
          
                                                             20.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh no.]
          
          
          EXT. TRASH ALLEY - DAY
          
          Wall-E racing as fast as he can.
          The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DAY
          
          The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck.
          A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof.
          Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold.
          Wall-E racing in the distance.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
          
          Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp.
          Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship.
          The cargo doors slam shut.
          
          The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up.
          Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship.
          Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him.
          Leads it back to the top of the hill.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay.]
          
          The insect mopes.
          Droops its little antennae.
          Wall-E motors back down to the rocket...
          
          BASE OF RECON SHIP
          
          The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE.
          Preparation for launch...
          
          
          INT. RECON SHIP
          
          Eve is secured into a slot.
          Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES.
          All dormant.
          Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT.
          The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window...
          
          OUTSIDE THE SHIP
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
          ...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side.
          The ship's engines ignite.
          Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support.
          The rocket takes off into space.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF HILL
          
          The cockroach watches his master go.
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP
          
          The spaceship roars through the sky.
          Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's.
          He looks ahead. SCREAMS.
          
          HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES
          
          litter the outer atmosphere.
          The ship bursts through the layer.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The recon ship breaks free of the planet.
          Its boosters shut down.
          Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE.
          Looks back at his planet.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Oooh...
          
          Weightlessness takes effect.
          Wall-E almost floats away.
          Grabs hold of the ship.
          Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        E-vah!
          
          No response. She remains shut down.
          Wall-E points out at the stars.
          It is the most spectacular light show possible.
          And Wall-E has a front row seat.
          
          MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES
          
          - The ship flies past the MOON.
            A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER.
            "BNL Outlet Coming Soon."
          
          - The ship passes by the SUN.
            Wall-E pops open his solar panels.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
           Instantly recharges.
          
          - The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS.
            Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER
          
          A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space.
          Wall-E is mesmerized by it.
          Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead.
          A planet?
          No. A starliner.
          Gigantic in size.
          
          The "AXIOM".
          
          The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
          
          
          INT. DOCKING BAY
          
          TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in.
          It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck.
          The impact knocks Wall-E off.
          He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace.
          
          Suddenly the entire dock comes to life.
          Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear.
          ...Rise from the floor...
          ..Lower from the ceiling...
          It's a cacophony of automation.
          They all attend to the ship.
          
          EVE
          
          and four other probes slide out of the ship's side.
          Suspended in a horizontal rack.
          Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him.
          She remains shut down.
          Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah... ?
          
          A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock.
          A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.
          
                                      M-O
                                (beeps)
                         [Hold up.]
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
          Waits for the FLOOR LINES to appear.
          Depict their exact path of action.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Okay. Go.]
          
          They file out on the line.
          
          A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack.
          M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready.
          M-O scans Eve.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant."
          
          M-O is disgusted.
          Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean.
          A VACU-BOT follows after him.
          Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off.
          
          The cleaning crew waits for probe #2.
          Wall-E studies the routine.
          Figures out a way to climb down to Eve.
          When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3.
          The crane grabs him instead.
          
          M-O turns around to clean the next probe.
          Wall-E is lowered in front of him.
          Boxes up.
          Confused, M-O scans him.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant."
          M-O is horrified by such filth.
          A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
          
          He scrubs Wall-E full force.
          Wall-E's front panel pushes him away.
          Confused, M-O moves to clean him again.
          Wall-E backs away.
          Leaves a DIRT TRAIL.
          M-O curses:
          
                                     M-O
                        [You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]
          
                                                                    24.
          
          
          M-O furiously scrubs the floor.
          Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.
          
          ON FAR WALL
          
          Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall.
          Act like hovering caution signs.
          A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE.
          He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face.
          Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow.
          
          BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E
          
          M-O just finishes cleaning the floor.
          Wall-E is fascinated.
          Impishly makes another mark.
          M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Look, it stays clean. You got that?]
          
          Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face.
          M-O loses it.
          Scrubs his own face.
          
          Gopher and his steward escort arrive.
          The cleaning crew stand at attention.
          Wall-E boxes back up with the probes.
          
          Gopher begins scanning each probe.
          Moves down the line.
          Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe...
          Stops -- Wait a minute.
          Turns back.
          Wall-E is gone.
          Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds...
          Reaches Eve.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her.
          Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT --
          
          The entire dock goes to "Code Green"!
          
          Alarms sound.
          Green lights flash.
          All automation stops.
          
          In rapid succession...
          ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher...
          ...A crane-bot loads Eve...
          ...Curved energy bands lock her down...
          ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat...
          
          It's all moving too fast for Wall-E.
          Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          
                                      WALL-E
                          Ee-vah!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          Grabs onto the back of the transport.
          They disappear into the elevator.
          
          The cleaning crew files out.
          Follow their lines back to their hold.
          M-O stops short.
          Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY
          
          Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT"
          
          The tracks lead to the elevator.
          M-O's neurosis takes over.
          Must clean dirt.
          He makes a radical decision and...
          ...jumps off his line.
          Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass.
          Wall-E hidden behind the transport.
          Peeks at Eve.
          Pets her blank faceplate.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet beeps)
                          [It'll be okay, Eve.]
          
          The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway.
          All following glowing lines on the floor.
          Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth.
          Tries to process it all.
          Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic...
          ...without him!
          
          Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic.
          Timidly attempts to merge.
          Sticks out one tread...
          -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP.
          Wall-E boxes up. Guns it.
          Weaves across all the lines on the floor.
          Bounces off robots like bumper cars.
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          Barely able to navigate the chaos.
          Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION.
          Scans for Eve...
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY
          
          ...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign...
          ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute...
          ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp...
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          
          
          INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wall-E flies up the ramp.
          Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR.
          It blocks his way.
          Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers
          
          A HUMAN PASSENGER
          
          sitting, reclined, in the chair.
          He is large, round and soft - like a big baby.
          Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit.
          The chair seems to be steering itself.
          Guided by floor lines, just like the robots.
          Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face.
          He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well, I've been in my cabin all morning
                        so let's hover over to the driving range
                        and hit a few virtual balls into space.
          
                                     PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN)
                        Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want
                        to do that.
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well then what do you want to do?
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He looks over his shoulder.
          Passenger #2 is floating right next to them.
          Isolated in his own hover chair.
          Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
                                     PASSENGER #2
                        I don't know. Something.
          
          Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence.
          They all exit the hallway. Merge into the...
          
          ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD
          
          Wall-E is in awe.
          Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides.
          THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space.
          All reclined and riding on hover chairs.
          MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions.
          
          Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes.
          Absolutely no reason to ever get up.
          No purpose.
          Every one of them engrossed in their video screens.
          Cocooned in virtual worlds.
          Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS.
          The controls allow them to steer...
          ...order food...
          ...play games...
          ...and most of all...
          
          ...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers:
          
          The CHATTER is deafening.
          No one notices Wall-E at all.
          He drives into the endless human traffic.
          
                                     MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER
                        Bot, over here!
          
          A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger.
          Puts a fresh drink in her open hand.
          Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.
          
                                     MISC. PASSENGERS
                        I can't hear you...I'm in a tunnel.
                        You're breaking up...Oh, okay. You're
                        back. I can hear you now...
          
          They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the
          
          MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS)
          
          A city-sized, mall-like environment.
          All under a GIANT DOME.
          The ceiling simulates the sun and sky.
          A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN.
          
                                                                    28.
          
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Buy N Large. Everything you need to be
                        happy. Your day is very important to us.
          
          Wall-E is gobsmacked.
          A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him.
          Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey, Drink-bot.
          
          Wall-E shies away.
          John reaches farther out with the cup.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!
          
          Reaches too far.
          John falls to the floor.
          Flails like an upside down turtle.
          Unable to stand on his baby legs.
          
          Instantly, SIRENS.
          Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive.
          Block John's accident.
          EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor.
          Redirect the hover chair traffic.
          John reaches out for assistance.
          Nobody notices. Just drive past.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please remain stationary. A service-bot
                        will be here to assist you momentarily.
          
          Suddenly John begins to rise.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Uhh...Hey! What's going on?
          
          Wall-E lifting him up from behind.
          Loads him back onto his chair.
          John doesn't know how to react.
          Wall-E waves hello.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E!
          
                                       JOHN
                        Uhh... John.
          
                                                                       29.
          
          
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                          JOHN
                           Uh no, John.
          
          Wall-E scans the concourse.
          Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL.
          He races after them.
          Abandons the stunned John.
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah!
          
                                        JOHN
                                  (small wave)
                           Bye...Wall-E.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It pulls out of the station.
          Wall-E leaps on.
          Barely catches the last car.
          It glides down the concourse.
          
          
          INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER
          
          A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS.
          All wearing matching BNL ONESIES.
          Motionless in their HOVER RINGS.
          They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens.
          
                                        NANNY-BOT

          Wall-E's monorail glides past.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery.
          Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by.
          Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.

                           Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.
          
          Wall-E now notices his fellow passengers.
          They all slurp from similar cups.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          Next, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON.
          BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Feel beautiful.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOTS
                               (pre-recorded lines)
                        ...It's the new you...Oh stunning...You
                        look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men...
          
          They pass through the FASHION DISTRICT.
          ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue! It's
                        the new red!
          
                                    MONORAIL PASSENGERS
                        Oooohh...
          
          Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons.
          Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Whoa.
          
          Their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel.
          
          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          
          Wall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him.
          Spots Eve on the other side.
          Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary.
          But her chair moves backwards.
          Smashes Wall-E against the back wall.
          No way getting past her.
          Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention.
          She's oblivious.
          Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:
          
                                     MARY
                        Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me
                        started! Every holo-date I've been on has
                        been a virtual disaster! If I could just
                        meet one who wasn't so superficial. There
                        are no good men out there!...
          
          Wall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest.
          Accidentally breaks it off.
          
                                     MARY (CONT'D)
                        ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled
                        through them all -- (Gasp) What the --?
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          
          Mary's chair shorts out.
          ...holo-screen shuts off...
          ...jumpsuit defaults back to red...
          For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view.
          Her eyes slowly dilate.
          It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time...
          
                                     MARY
                               (mesmerized)
                        Huh... ?
          
          Her gaze falls on Wall-E.
          He waves politely.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
                                        MARY
                               (beat)
                        M-mary.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah.
          
          He points to Eve on the other side of Mary.
          Gestures he'd like to get by.
          She is slow to understand.
          
                                     MARY
                        Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead.
          
          Mary moves her hover chair back.
          Wall-E rolls over to Eve.
          Pats her protectively.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY
          
          The monorail emerges into "First Class."
          A vast, circular plaza of pools.
          Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments.
          Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside.
          All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS.
          
                                       POOLSIDE PASSENGER
                                 (claps; umbrella-bot opens)
                        Shade.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA.
          
                                                                     32.
          
          
          The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower.
          The passengers exit.
          Follow their respective lines.
          Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower.
          Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor.
          
          ON MARY
          
          She is the last to exit the car.
          Doesn't follow any lines.
          Excited by her newfound awareness.
          Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.
          
                                     MARY
                        I didn't know we had a pool!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE LOBBY
          
          Eve's transport enters the cavernous hall.
          A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end.
          A bridge elevator behind him.
          Blocked by a force field gate.
          
          The transport pulls up to the typing-bot.
          Gopher BEEPS.
          The typing-bot responds by typing.
          Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...
          
          Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open.
          The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator.
          Notices Wall-E hiding at the back.
          Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close.
          The elevator shoots up to the bridge.
          
          The typing-bot looks at its hand.
          Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture.
          Huh. Never done that before.
          Tries it some more...
          
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
          
          Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck.
          Marvels at it all.
          His view suddenly goes dark.
          The elevator doors open on...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The large circular room is dimly lit.
          Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other.
          A massive console wraps around its entirety.
          Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights.
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers.
          
          Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps.
          Suddenly the wheel disengages.
          The autopilot (AUTO).
          A single camera eye lights up its center.
          A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling.
          Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes.
          Auto eyes Eve. Scans her.
          Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows.
          
          Auto detects Eve's plant light.
          Goes still...
          Begins computing rapidly.
          The number "A113" flashes on his lens.
          An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.
          
          Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous.
          Without warning, Auto heads in his direction.
          Wall-E boxes up.
          A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him.
          Irises open, like a trapdoor.
          
          Wall-E drops...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          ...and hits the floor hard in the room below.
          Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING.
          
          Auto lowers through the portal.
          A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
          
                                        AUTOPILOT
                           Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
          
          Shoots back up. The portal closes.
          Wall-E peeks out of his box.
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV
          
          PAN across the nautical-themed cabin.
          One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS.
          Their years of service listed below.
          The autopilot in the background of each picture.
          Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other.
          From human to gelatinous blob.
          We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT.
          A blobby Captain.
          It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed.
          
          He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm.
          Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          Activates the POYSC SAMPLE.
          It plays loud.
          The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          -- All hands on deck!!
          
          Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as...
          ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry...
          ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT...
          ...The Captain's bed automatically raises...
          ...Forms into a hover chair...
          The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.
          
                                       BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                                 (pre-recorded)
                          Morning! Just a trim?
          
          Wall-E blends in with the primping.
          Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          (Giggles)
          
          Lines light on the floor.
          Lead his chair automatically to the elevator.
          Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Elevator doors swish open.
          The Captain still half-asleep.
          Claps his hands twice.
          
          On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console.
          Pours a cup.
          CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers.
          The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH.
          Leads him over to the coffee.
          Wall-E stays lockstep behind him.
          Auto glides over to the Captain.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT
                          Sir --
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Coffee.
          
          Wall-E hides under the console just in time.
          
          The Captain reaches for his coffee.
          Makes a minimal effort.
          Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward...
          ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
          
                                                                        35.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, the annual --
          
          The Captain gives Auto the hand.
          Sips his coffee.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Protocol, Auto. First things first.

                        Computer, status report.
          
          His chair automatically arcs along the console.
          SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.

          He eyes Eve on the transport across the room.
          Has to get to her.
          But Auto is right above him. Can't move.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT
                        Captain...
          
          Auto calls up a screen on the console.
          Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe.
          Waits patiently for the Captain to notice.
          Finally, the Captain turns...
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                        Okay, Auto.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, the annual reconnaissance has --
          
          ...but then notices the time.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        12:30?!
                               (disappointed sigh)
                        Auto, why didn't you wake me for the
                        morning announcements?
          
          He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge.
          Wall-E nearly collides with him.
          
                                                                       36.
          
          
          Ducks back under the console.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do
                        on this ship.
          
          Grabs a large dial.

          An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom.
          A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN.
          Displays a live video feed of the Captain.
          The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM)
                               (unmotivated)
                        Well, good morning everybody, and welcome
                        to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As
                        always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and
                        sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's
                        log is showing that today is our 700th
                        anniversary of our five year cruise.
                        Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
                        proud to know that 700 years later we'd
                        be...
                               (deflates)
                        ...doing the exact same thing...they were
                        doing...
          
          Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING.
          The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (INTERCOM)
                               (snaps out of ennui)
                        SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your
                        free...
                               (hard to pronounce)
                        ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup.
                        Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto,
                        what's that flashing button?
                               (mic feedback whine)
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console.
          It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
                                    AUTOPILOT (O.S.)
                        Captain?
          
          The Captain turns to Auto.
          For the first time he notices Eve. Finally.
          Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Probe One has returned positive.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Positive?
          
          Auto re-activates Eve.
          She wakes.
          Rises to salute the Captain.
          
          Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy.
          She's okay!
          He is compelled to head straight for her...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But...no probe's ever come back
                        positive...
                               (looks at flashing button)
                        ...before.
          
          The flashing button is practically calling to him.
          Can't resist. Presses it.
          Instantly SHADES close on all the windows.
          The room goes dark.
          
          ...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again...
          
          A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him.
          Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Greetings and congratulations, Captain!
                        If you're seeing this, that means your
                        Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,
                        or...
                               (air quotes)
                        ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth
                        with a confirmed specimen of ongoing
                        photosynthesis!
          
          The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen.
          Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        That's right, it means it's time to go
                        back home!
          
                                                                     38.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (nervous)
                        Home? W-w-we're going back?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Now that Earth has been restored to a
                        life-sustaining status, by golly, we can
                        begin "Operation Recolonize"!
          
          A section of the console illuminates.
          An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out...
          
          ...into a passing Wall-E's hands.
          
          Wall-E immediately boxes up.
          Holds the manual over his head.
          The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium.
          Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover.
          It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE".
          Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Simply follow this manual's instructions
                        to place the plant in your ship's holo-
                        detector, and the --
                               (bad edit)
                        -- Axiom -- will immediately navigate
                        your return to Earth! It's that easy!
          
          ON VIDEO SCREEN (DURING SPEECH)
          
          An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge.
          The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up.
          A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine.
          A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth.
          
          The Captain listens closely to the instructions.
          Wall-E paying attention as well.
          
                     CAPTAIN                          WALL-E
          Huh?                               Huh?
          
          Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve.
          Heads in her direction.

                        Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity,
                        you and your passengers may have suffered
                        some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few
                        laps around your ship's jogging track
                        will get you back in shape in no time.
          
          The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.
          
                                                                   39.

                        If you have any further questions just
                        consult your operation manual. See you
                        back home real soon.
          
          The transmission ends.
          The Captain examines the manual.
          Holds it out in front of him.
          
                                     CAPTAIN

                        Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel?
          
          Auto intervenes.
          Clips the corner of the cover with his handle...
          ...and simply opens the book.
          The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated.
          Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wow... Will you look at that?
          
          ON EVE
          
          Wall-E taps her shoulder.
          Not now Wall-E -- Double take!
          
                                    EVE
                        Wall-E?!

                               (tiny wave)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          Eve is in a state of disbelief.
          Shoves Wall-E into the shadows under the console.
          
                                     EVE
                               (hushed; angry)

          Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him.
          Wall-E just stares at her.
          Smitten.
          
                                                                      40.

          ON THE CAPTAIN
          
          He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.

          The bridge suddenly jumps to life.
          Green lights flash.
          A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling...
          ...Scans the entire room...
          ...Identifies Eve...
          ...Rides along the ceiling rails...
          ...Stations itself directly above Eve...
          ...Arms unfold. Position her...
          ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face:

                           Accepted.
          
          A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers.
          Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve...
          Her chest lights up.
          The doors open.
          The Captain winces...
          
          ...and nothing is inside.
          
                                        CAPTAIN

                           Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?
                                  (checks manual)
                           Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you
                           change the text again...
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
          Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual.
          Eve is stunned.
          Searches her chest cavity for the plant.
          Then she remembers...
          
                                     EVE
                        Plant! Wall-E...
                               (turns on him)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger.
          Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty.
          Picks him up. Scans the floor.
          Nothing.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?

                        [Find it!] PLANT!
          
          Wall-E scared of her.
          Starts searching.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        Why don't you scan her to be sure.
          
          Eve jumps back to attention.
          Auto slides up to her.
          Scans her chest cavity.

                        Correct, Captain.

                               (privately relieved)
                        Well, false alarm!
          
                                                                    42.
          
          
          
                                       SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        False alarm.
          
          Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts.
          Exits back into the ceiling.
          The shades rise.
          Lights go back on.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The probe must be defective. Gopher, send
                        her to the Repair Ward.
          
          Eve turns.
          Excuse me?
          Gopher hops to attention.
          Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          Loads her back onto the transport...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have them run diagnostics on her. Make
                        sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!
          
          ...and reveals WALL-E.
          Everyone stares at him.
          Long awkward pause.
          Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain.
          Shakes his hand.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
          Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm.
          The Captain stares at it.
          Turns to Auto.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have "Wall-E" cleaned.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The elevator opens.
          Gopher's transport drives out.
          Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands.
          The typing-bot has now mastered waving.
          Waves an enthusiastic goodbye.
          Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          She gives him the cold shoulder.
          Refuses to speak to him.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          The transport exits the lobby.
          
          BACK UP IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Analyze.
          
          The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light.
          It rotates.
          The captain sits at his vanity console.
          ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN.

                        to as "soil", "dirt", or "earth".
          
          The last word piques his interest.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Earth?
          
          His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Define "Earth"...

                        distinct from the sky or sea.
          
          Dozens of IMAGES OF LAND pop up on screen.
          Lush, green, colorful, inviting.
          He's fascinated.
          Takes it all in.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the Captain.
          Glued to his screen.
          Filled with ocean images.
          
                                                                     44.

          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL
          
          M-O continues to clean WALL-E'S FILTHY TRAIL.
          Oblivious to everything around him.
          Cuts through traffic.
          Robots crash into each other in his wake.
          M-O doesn't notice EVE AND WALL-E'S TRANSPORT drive past.
          They hover down a corridor, and enter...
          
          
          INT. REPAIR WARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          It's a fully automated clinic for broken bots.
          Day care for the malfunctioned.
          The REJECTS are kept in FORCE FIELD PENS.
          Dozens line the walls.
          
          Eve and Wall-E stop at the INSPECTION STATION.
          Robotic ORDERLY-ARMS activate.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          Watches them systematically check in Eve.
          Perform an I.D. scan.
          Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head.
          A button is pressed on the boot.
          Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Where are you going?!]
          
          The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E.
          He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him.
          Races through the ward.
          Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                               (pre-recorded)
                        Just a trim? Uh huh.
          
          She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up.
          Holds up a mirror.
          Wall-E gasps.
          
                                                                     45.

                        You look gorgeous.
          
          Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm.
          Placed in an empty force field pen.
          Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT:
          ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face...
          Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly.
          Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          
          Eve slides past Wall-E.
          Carried by an orderly-arm.
          Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM.
          The frosted glass doors shut.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          
          INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM
          
          Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots:
          
          - An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends.
            The orderly-arms struggle to close it.
          
          - A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY.
            It bursts into flames.
          
          Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode.
          A series of tests begin.
          Eve is annoyed but calm.
          It's all routine.
          An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm.
          
          OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD
          
          Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors.
          Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE.
          To him, her arm is being ripped off.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          BACK INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry.
          Her insides light up.
          It tickles.
          
                                    EVE
                        (Giggles)
          
                                                                    46.
          
          
          
          Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E
          
          Wall-E watches in horror.
          It looks as if Eve is being tortured.
          Mistakes the screeching for her screams.
          Wall-E struggles to free himself.
          
          INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          She is washed and scrubbed.
          A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body.
          It feels good.
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          It looks as if Eve is being beheaded.
          He needs to stop the torture.
          Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field.
          The barrier shorts out.
          Wall-E tumbles to the floor.
          Lands on his "Play" button.
          POYSC blares across the ward.
          The Rejects all stop and stare.
          
                                       WALL-E
                          EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!
          
          Wall-E races to the diagnostics room.
          Crashes right through the glass doors.
          Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms.
          Grabs Eve's separated gun arm.
          Points it at the orderly-arms.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (angry beeps)
                          [Let her go, or I'll shoot!]
          
          His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style.
          Doesn't realize...
          
          ...he's holding the gun backwards.
          
          Eve slowly reaches for the weapon.
          
                                       EVE
                                 ("Put the gun down...")
                          Wall-E...
          
          An orderly lunges at him.
          Wall-E panics. Shoots!
          The gun fires backwards.
          It blasts through the repair ward.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL.
          
          Wall-E shrinks.
          He knows he's in trouble.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT.
          ...All orderly-arms go limp...
          ...The repair ward doors open up...
          ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear...
          
          The Rejects look at each other for a beat.
          Then CHEER wildly.
          We're free!
          
          The mob of robots all rush Wall-E.
          Lift him on their shoulders.
          Carry their hero out of the ward.
          Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm.
          
          Eve watches in astonishment.
          This day just gets worse and worse.
          She flies off after them.

          The REJECT MOB stampedes through the halls.
          Disrupts all robot traffic.
          Wall-E carried over their heads.
          Suddenly, the mob stops in front of...
          
                                                                    48.

          Wall-E's dropped in front of them.
          Still holds Eve's gun.
          Cowers.
          A TINY ROBOT pushes Wall-E closer.
          Show `em who's boss.

          Eve catches up to them.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          Snatches her arm back.

          The stewards prepare to fire SUSPENSION BEAMS (like Gopher).
          Eve realizes what's about to happen.
          Grabs Wall-E.
          Flies over the stewards.
          
                                       STEWARDS
                        Halt. Halt.
          
          The mass of rejects take their cue.
          Robot rebellion!
          They bust through the steward blockade.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past.
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          Match them with the "Wanted" screens.
          Call attention to them. Point.
          Stewards in hot pursuit.
          
          Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY.
          Lets the stewards pass by.
          She glances out the porthole...
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          She can see the DOCKING BAY below her.
          Just under the bay doors...
          
          ...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS.
          
          Eve gets an idea.
          Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway...
          
          INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence.
          Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN)
                         Caution: Rogue robots.
          
          Wall-E points to it.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (beeps)
                         [Hey look! We're on TV -- !]
          
          Eve aims her gun at the screen.
          Blows it to pieces.
          Wall-E shrinks into a box.
          Never mind.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY
          
          Dark.
          The elevator chimes.
          Eve and Wall-E step out.
          Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway.
          Eve approaches "Bay #1".
          She and Wall-E enter...
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eve navigates the dark.
          Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE.
          Fiddles with some buttons.
          
                                                              50.
          
          
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He glances down at EVE'S HAND.
          Privately intertwines his fingers.
          Maybe now is the right moment...
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet)
                          Ee-vah...?
          
          FLASH!
          Banks of controls light up around them.
          
          AN ESCAPE POD
          
          is revealed at the end of the room.
          Its hatch automatically opens.
          Bathes the room with light from its lit interior.
          Eve turns to Wall-E:
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN.
          It displays coordinates to Earth.
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod.
          He happily complies.
          Jumps up on one of the seats.
          Pats the seat next to him.
          Aren't you coming?
          
          Eve remains at the threshold.
          Shakes her head.
          Points to her chest.
          Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
          
                                       EVE
                          Directive.
          
          ...She's not going.
          
          This changes everything.
          Wall-E races out of the pod.
          Boxes up.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (beeps)
                          [Then I'm not going either.]
          
          Eve shakes her head.
          
                                                                        51.
          
          
          
                                        EVE
                                  (gentle, but firm)
                         Wall-E.
          
          Carries his box back into the pod.
          Exits.
          Wall-E follows her right back out.
          Drives behind the console.
          You can't make me.
          Eve sighs.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (frustrated)
                         Wall-E.
          
          The hallway elevator CHIMES.
          They both look up.
          Someone is coming.
          
          Eve shuts off everything.
          Lights go out. The pod closes back up.
          Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall.
          Blend in with the other wall fixtures.
          
          They HEAR something hover into the     room.
          Can't see what it is.
          Then...
          An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over     the console.
          Presses buttons.
          The pod lights up again. The hatch     opens.
          The stranger's SHADOW comes around     the console to reveal...
          
          GOPHER
          
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other.
          Gopher?
          They watch from the shadows as...
          ...Gopher enters the pod...
          ...opens his chest cavity...
          ...emits his suspension beam...
          
          ...and deposits the PLANT.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (excited whisper)
                         Plant!
          
          Gopher exits the pod.
          
          CLOSE ON EVE
          
          She keeps her eyes on Gopher.
          Watches him return to the console.
          She turns to speak to Wall-E --
          
                                                              52.
          
          
          He's gone.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (whisper)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E is inside the pod.
          Picks up the plant.
          Proudly shows it to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud whisper)
                        Ee-vah!
          
                                       EVE
                                 (louder whisper)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Too late.
          Gopher hits a button.
          The pod door shuts on Wall-E...
          
          ...and launches into space.
          
          Gopher shuts off the room.
          Exits.
          
          Eve leaps out of the shadows.
          Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW.
          Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance.
          The plant icon on Eve's chest glows.
          She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK.
          Enters it like a phone booth.
          
          OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve bursts out into space.
          Rockets after Wall-E.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD
          
          Wall-E plastered against the back of the pod.
          It suddenly reduces speed.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Cruising speed.
          
          He drops to the floor.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        You are now free to move around the
                        cabin.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
          Wall-E fumbles to get his bearings.
          Peers out the rear hatch window.
          Sees the Axiom receding from view.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Yikes!]
          
          He clambers up into the pilot's seat.
          Pulls back hard on the throttle.
          Nothing happens.
          Looks down at the console.
          A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Twenty seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Uh oh.
          Wall-E frantically hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button.
          No change.
          Pushes every button on the console.
          Everything activates:
          ...Lights flash...
          ...Oxygen masks drop...
          
          OUTSIDE THE POD
          
          ...Windshield wipers activate...
          ...Flares fire off...
          ...Parachutes deploy...
          
          BACK INSIDE THE POD
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Ten seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Wall-E panics.
          Looks for a means of escape.
          Spots the hatch.
          Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Shoots himself to the door.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
                        three, two...
          
          Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER.
          The hatch won't open!
          
          ON EVE
          
          She races through space after him.
          Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                     EVE
                        No, no, no...
          
          She flies towards the debris field, when --
          
          Wall-E whizzes right past her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vaaaaaah!
          
          He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Uses it as a form of propulsion.
          Eve is consumed with relief.
          Chases after him.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He points the extinguisher the other way.
          Attempts to fly back over to her.
          It's hard to steer...
          
          ...They rocket right past each other again...
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay there! I'll come to you!]
          
          Eve waits.
          Wall-E finally has the hang of steering.
          Fires short bursts.
          Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve.
          Gets extinguisher foam in her face.
          She giggles.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               ("Look what I've got")
                        Ee-vah...
          
          He opens his compactor door.
          Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Gasp!)
          
          ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV
          
          ...Sensors zero in on the plant...
          ...Confirm its authenticity...
          ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears...
          ...Draws directions to the bridge...
          ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"...
          
                                                           55.
          
          
          
          Eve is ecstatic.
          She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam.
          Seals it safely in her chest.
          Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms.
          Spins him around.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E! (Laughs)
          
          Wall-E can't believe his luck.
          Rests his head on her shoulder.
          Bliss.
          
          Eve stops spinning.
          Leans her head against his.
          A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them.
          A "thank you" kiss.
          
          Wall-E's METER spikes.
          He floats circles in space.
          
                                    WALL-E
                              (swoons)
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Come on. Time's a wastin'.]
          
          She reaches for his hand.
          Wall-E shakes his head.
          Holds up his extinguisher instead.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [I can fly myself.]
          
          Kicks on the extinguisher.
          Spins in a pirouette...
          ...and flies away.
          Eve giggles.
          Chases after him.
          
          BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS
          
          The two fly around the stern of the ship.
          Wall-E does a few barrel rolls.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Try that.]
          
          Eve giggles.
          Matches him move for move.
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          The pair fly between the BOOSTER ENGINES of the ship.
          Weave in and out of the rocket flames.
          Bank up along the ship's port side.
          Execute a double helix in perfect unison...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM'S OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
          
          Passengers hover down the hallway.
          All focused on their private screens.
          No one looks out at the stars.
          
          ...except for MARY.
          
          She has pulled over to the side.
          Stares wistfully out the DECK WINDOW.
          
                                      MARY
                               (sigh)
                        So many stars.
          
          Spots EVE & WALL-E dancing among the stars.
          
                                     MARY
                        Oooh...
                               (recognizes Wall-E)
                        Hey, that's what's his name --
          
          She backs up to wave hello.
          Bumps into JOHN'S HOVER CHAIR.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey! What the --
          
          Mary leans over to his armrest.
          Turns off his holo-screen.
          Points out the window.
          
                                     MARY
                        Look! Look at THAT!
          
                                     JOHN
                               (disoriented)
                        Wha...huh?
          
          Wall-E flies past the window.
          A wave of recognition hits John.
          He comes to life, as if wakened from a long sleep.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey... I know that guy! It's, uh...
                               (snaps fingers)
                        Wall-E! Hey Wall-E! It's your buddy, John!
          
                                                                       57.
          
          
          
                                     MARY
                        Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!
          
          They both wave until Wall-E's out of sight.
          John absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest...
          
          ...and touches Mary's hand.
          
          Both turn towards each other.
          They make eye contact for the first time.
          Awkward beat.
          
                                       JOHN
                        Hi.

                        Hi.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E AND EVE
          
          They soar across the Axiom's bow.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto busy operating the ship.
          Doesn't see Eve and Wall-E outside the window.
          Auto turns the SKY DIAL from DAY TO NIGHT.
          
          INSIDE THE CONCOURSE
          
          The sky dome fast-forwards to evening.
          PAN OVER to the top of the bridge tower.
          The windows of the Captain's quarters are dark.
          Only the FLICKERING GLOW OF A HOLO-SCREEN lights the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (V.O.)

          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT - SAME
          
          The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research.
          MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen.
          Crops, farms, a barn, etc....
          An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.

                        "Hoedown" - a social gathering at which
                        lively dancing would take place.
          
          An aperture opens in the ceiling above.
          Auto lowers down to face the Captain.
          
                                                                     58.

                               (points to images)
                        These are called "farms". Humans would
                        put seeds in the ground, pour water on
                        them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --

                        Good night, Captain.

                        (annoyed grunt)
          
          Auto rises back up to the bridge.
          The aperture shuts. Lights out.
          The Captain glares at the ceiling.
          Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Psst! Computer.
                               (the holo-screen lights up)
                        Define "dancing".
          
          BACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side.
          Spiral gracefully around one another.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        "Dancing" - A series of movements,
                        involving two partners, where speed and
                        rhythm match harmoniously with music.
          
          Wall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam.
          He lets it float freely out into space.
          Eve catches him in her arms.
          Wall-E croons.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          Eve scans the Axiom for a way in.
          Notices SPARKS.
          Down on the ship's lower hull...
          
          CLOSER ON LOWER HULL
          
          A REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna.
          Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him.
          It shuts.
          Burn-e bangs on the closed door.
          Stuck outside.
          
                                                                    59.

                          [Hey! Let me in! Let me in!]
                                 (looks around)

                          The Lido Deck is now closing...The Lido
                          Deck is now closing.
          
          The last few passengers exit the pool area.
          All wearing the same color blue uniforms...
          
          ...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool.
          
          CLOSE ON FEET
          
          They ripple the surface of the pool.
          John and Mary float over the water's surface.
          Splash one another playfully.
          
                                       JOHN
                          Hey now. Stop that...
          
                                       MARY
                          Make me (giggles).
          
                                       JOHN
                          I didn't know we had a pool.
          
          A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower.
          Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
          
                                       LIFEGUARD-BOT
                          No splashing, no diving.
          
                                       JOHN & MARY
                                 (annoyed)
                          Ahh! Go on!
          
          John splashes the robot.
          It shorts out.
          
          ON UPPER DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck.
          Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS.
          Eve peeks through the towels.
          Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS.
          On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance.
          No way in.
          
                                                                    60.
          
          
          
          A TRASH-BOT passes.
          Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE.
          Eve keys in on the chute.
          It runs all the way up the tower...
          
          ...to the bridge.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He stares at EVE'S HAND.
          Time to seize the moment.
          Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest.
          It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker.
          Puts his hands together...
          
          Eve whips around.
          What's that noise?!
          Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
          
                                        WALL-E
                           E-vah --
          
          Eve immediately shuts off his music.
          Shoves his hands down.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (hushed hums)
                           [Stop it! They'll hear us!]
          
          She places a stack of towels on his head.
          Gestures for Wall-E to stay put.
          Points to her PLANT LIGHT.
          
                                        EVE
                           Directive.
          
          Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone.
          Zooms silently across the Lido Deck.
          Up into the trash chute.
          
          CLOSE ON EARTH
          
          It sits in space.
          The AXIOM glides towards it.
          Something's not right.
          We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain sits by his window to space.
          Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.
          
                                                                      61.

                          [Landing noises] We're here everybody!
                          Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain
                          we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd
                          cheers]...No it's nothing. I was pleased
                          to do it. It's all about you people --
          
          ON TRASH CAN
          
          NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel.
          Blows the lid off.
          The Captain is stunned by this vision.
          She opens her chest to reveal...
          
          ...the plant.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                                 (amazed)
                          How...? How'd you find it?!
          
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Salutes.
          Formally presents him the plant.
          He takes it in his hands.
          Still potted in the old boot.
          Gazes at it in wonder.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          We can go back home...for the first time!
                                 (laughs)
                          What's it like now?
          
          Eve shrugs.
          Doesn't know how to answer.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for
                          myself!
          
          He turns to his console.
          Hits a button.
          A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel.
          The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device.
          Plays back images of her time on Earth.
          
          A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past.
          All displayed from Eve's POV:
          ...Being delivered to Earth...
          ...Flying above the devastated landscape...
          ...Blowing up a rock...
          ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wait...that doesn't look like Earth...
                        Where's the blue sky...
          
          He looks over to his computer screen.
          The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display.
          Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...Where's the grass?
          
          His face drops.
          Slumps in defeat.
          The dream is over.
          
          ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN
          
          The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays...
          It stirs the Captain out of his funk.
          He looks up at the screen.
          Leans in for a closer look.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...I know that song...
                               (observes the dancers' feet)
                        And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
          
          A rueful smile grows on his face.
          He looks down at
          
          HIS FOOT
          
          It's tapping in time to the music.
          His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands.
          He lifts it up.
          Makes the boot dance.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...You made it somehow, eh little guy?
                        You didn't give up, did you?
          
          As if in response, the plant wilts slightly.
          A leaf drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Gasp!) Oh no, no --
                               (remembers)
                        Wait a minute.
          
          The Captain urgently hovers across the room.
          Eve left alone.
          Her recorded memories continue playing...
          
          ...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment.
          
                                                          63.
          
          
          Eve recognizes the music.
          Watches the lovers on screen hold hands.
          Something familiar about the gesture...
          Looks at her own hands.
          Slowly, she interlocks her fingers...
          ...Eve's eyes go wide.
          This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her.
          
          Her memories continue on the screen:
          ...a tap on the shoulder...
          ...Wall-E presents her the plant --
          ...The screen goes BLACK!
          
          Then...
          
          ...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates.
          
          Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out:
          ...protecting her from the rain...
          ...the sun...the sandstorm...
          ...keeping watch night and day...
          ...trying to jump start her heart...
          
          ON EVE
          
          Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her.
          Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.
          
                                        EVE
                               (soft)
                        Wall-E...
          
          She looks at her hands again.
          
          MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS
          
          Still waiting between the towel racks.
          Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah...
                               (gives up; beeps)
                        [I'll never get it right.]
          
          Becomes impatient.
          Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE.
          Sticks his head in.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        EE-VAHH?!
          
          No answer.
          The chute has an endless drop.
          Wall-E climbs in.
          
                                                                     64.
          
          
          Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place.
          Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters...
          
          OUT ON THE UPPER DECK
          
          A monorail pulls up.
          M-O steps off.
          Still hot on Wall-E's trail.
          Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby.
          Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS...
          
          ...leading to the trash chute.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Ah-hah! Gotcha!]
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain at his wet bar.
          Waters the plant in the sink.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        There you go little guy. You came a long
                        way for a drink of water... Just needed
                        someone to look after you, that's all --
          
          He is struck with a notion.
          Stares out the window at space for a beat.
          Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant.
          Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (to himself)
                        We have to go back.
          
          Activates his chair's call button.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, come down here!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT (ON SPEAKER)
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Eve is still watching Wall-E's vigil on the screen:
          ...playing Pong...
          ...Wall-E etches their names in a heart...
          Eve is lost in the moments.
          So touched.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smitten)
                        Wall-E...
                                     (MORE)
          
                                                                    65.
          
                                       EVE (CONT'D)
                                 (remembers)
                        Wall-E!
          
          He's still waiting for her.
          She turns to leave and finds
          
          AUTO
          
          lowering in front of her.
          Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand.
          "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the
                        Holo-detector.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Not necessary, Captain. You may give it
                        to me.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (not listening)
                        You know what? I should do it myself.
          
          Heads for the elevator.
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                        Captain!
          
          Auto shoots back upstairs.
          Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator.
          Blocks the Captain.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, get out of my way.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, we cannot go home.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What are you talking about? Why not?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        That is classified. Captain, give me the
                        plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (holds plant out of reach)
                        What do you mean, "classified"? You don't
                        keep secrets from the Captain!
          
                                                                   66.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me what's classified!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        The plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
          
          It's a stare down.
          Beat.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Auto rises back into the ceiling.
          Lowers down over the vanity console.
          High speed button pushing.
          A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears.
          Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY".
          The BNL FANFARE plays.
          Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium.
          Haggard. Nervous.
          Wears an emergency oxygen vest.
          The fanfare plays too long.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                               (to O.S.)
                        Just cut it off, will ya?!
                               (music stops; forced chuckle)
                        Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad
                        news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well...
                        failed! Wouldn't you know, rising
                        toxicity levels have made life
                        unsustainable on Earth.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Unsustainable? What?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Darn it all, we're going to have to
                        cancel Operation Recolonize.
                               (dons his life vest)
                        So just, uh...just stay the course.
                        Rather than try to fix this problem,
                        it'll just be easier if everyone remains
                        in space.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (offended)
                        Easier?
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          
                                     CEO ADVISOR (O.S.)
                        Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override
                        directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot.
                        Take control of everything! And do not
                        return to Earth!
                               (ready to run)
                        Repeat! Do not return to Earth!
                               (throws on his gas mask; to
                                camera crew)
                        Now let's get the heck out of here.
          
          The CEO races out of the room.
          The message cuts out.
          
          Auto turns to face the Captain.
          The Captain shakes his head in disgust.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Now, the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        No, wait a minute. Computer, when was
                        that message sent to the Axiom?
          
          The paused image on the holo-screen highlights.
          Data begins to calculate on the screen.
          We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS.
          It stops on "2110".
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Message received in the year 2110.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!!
                        Auto, things have changed! We've got to
                        go back!

                        Sir, orders are: "Do not return to
                        Earth".
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But life is sustainable now! Look at this
                        plant, green and growing! It's living
                        proof he was wrong.

                        Irrelevant, Captain.
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What?! It's completely relevant!
                               (points out to space)
                        Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And
                        it's in trouble! I can't just sit here
                        and...and...do nothing! That's all I've
                        done! That's all anyone on this blasted
                        ship has ever done...NOTHING!!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        On the Axiom you will survive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Must follow my directive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        DAAAARGH!!
          
          The Captain turns away in frustration.
          His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS.
          Notices AUTO in every one of them.
          Looking over all their shoulders.
          A little closer every generation.
          The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder...
          ...and Auto is right behind him.
          The Captain looks at the plant in his lap.
          His countenance grows determined.
          He rights his hat...
          ...turns to face Auto...
          ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are
                        going home today!
          
          Auto slides into his face.
          Makes the Captain flinch.
          No more Mr. Nice Robot.
          Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
          
          GOPHER
          
          shoots out of a pneumatic tube.
          Salutes Auto.
          Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay.
          She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Gopher?
          
          Gopher activates his suspension beam.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny!
                                  (to Eve)
                           Eve, arrest him!
          
          Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher.
          The robot raises his epaulet arms.
          Don't shoot!
          She opens her chest cavity.
          Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Eve, you are to put this plant straight
                           in the Holo-detector.
          
          Gopher slowly advances towards Eve.
          But then tosses the plant across the room...
          
          ...down the TRASH CHUTE.
          
                                           CAPTAIN
                           No!
          
                                           EVE
                                  (hums)
                           [Oh no!]
          
          It's over.
          The plant is gone.
          But in that frozen moment...
          
          ON TRASH CHUTE
          
          ...THE PLANT suddenly reappears.
          Rises like a ghost, up from the chute.
          Wall-E's head follows.
          Unawares of the plant resting on his head.
          
                                           WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                           CAPTAIN & EVE
                           WALL-E!!
          
          Wall-E straddles the top of the lip chute.
          The plant drops onto his chest.
          Wall-E looks at it with surprise.
          
                                        WALL-E
                                  (beeps)
                           [Hey, the plant.]
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN & EVE
                        Wall-E! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here!]
          
          Wall-E is slow to understand.
          Finally picks up the plant.
          Anticipates to throw it, when...
          ...Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
          Eve moves to help Wall-E.
          But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam.
          
          Wall-E dodges Auto's multi-arm advances.
          Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest.
          Slams it shut.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [You can't have it!]
          
          Auto flips open one of his handles.
          Produces a TASER...
          
          ...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
          
          Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out.
          He wheezes...
          ...then drops lifelessly down the chute.
          
          Eve screams.
          Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto.
          The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed.
          She shuts down.
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE
          
          Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening.
          Drops her down the chute.
          She bangs against the sides as she tumbles.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          Gopher salutes Auto and exits.
          Auto turns to the Captain.
          He is in shock.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        All communications are terminated. You
                        are confined to quarters.
          
          The power shuts off in the room.
          Auto rises back up through the ceiling...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          
          DOWN SHOT THROUGH BRIDGE FLOOR APERTURE
          
          The Captain looks up.
          Shakes his fist in fury.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                         NO! MUTINY! MUTINY! MUTINEEEEE!!
          
          The aperture closes TO BLACK.
          
          Beat.
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          Black.
          The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes.
          Her view comes into focus.
          Scans around. Disoriented.
          
          
          INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
          
          Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH.
          Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere.
          Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES.
          
          Eve looks down.
          COMPUTER MICE crawl over her.
          One of them has crawled over her REBOOT button.
          Switched her back on.
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          A warning alarm sounds.
          Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES.
          It slides into an AIRLOCK.
          Inner shield doors lock and seal.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                         Caution: Activating airlock
                         disposal...Activating airlock disposal.
          
          The exterior hatch flies open.
          The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash.
          
          Eve begins to panic.
          Calls out again:
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          Suddenly, her area is flooded in light.
          She flinches at the sight of
          
                                                            72.
          
          
          
          TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS
          
          as they rumble up behind her.
          Headlights for eyes.
          They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E.
          "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts.
          Each grab a ton of trash at once.
          Eve is swept up with the junk.
          Compact it. Spit it out...
          
          ...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube.
          
          Her cube is picked up.
          Transported to a waiting platform.
          Stacked with other massive cubes.
          Eve discovers...
          
          ...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E!
          
          He groans.
          Not doing well.
          
          Again the alarms kick in.
          The platform slides on rails...
          ...across the safety line...
          ...into the airlock...
          ...the inner shield doors begin to close...
          
          INSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve needs to act fast.
          Her gun arm stuck inside the cube.
          Struggles to activate it...
          ...It cocks.
          BLASTS herself free.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          He's stuck deep in the cube...
          
          BACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          M-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute.
          Lands in a pile of trash.
          Covered with filth.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Primal scream.]
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Piles of trash everywhere.
          The airlock doors closing in the distance.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          ZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E.
          His screen reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT".
          
                                       M-O
                                 (beeps)
                          [I have you now!]
          
          M-O speeds towards the airlock.
          
          ON EVE
          
          Tugs on Wall-E.
          Desperate to free him.
          He's slow to pull loose...
          
          ...THE GAP in the doors narrows...
          
          ...Eve's never going to make it...
          
          ON M-O
          
          Racing towards the doors.
          He's almost at the airlock...
          The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms.
          M-O is stuck.
          
          The exterior hatch opens:
          ...Eve yanks Wall-E free...
          ...The trash flies out into space...
          ...She flies against the force...
          ...Fights to reach M-O...
          ...Grabs onto his roller...
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          The WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door.
          Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock.
          The exterior hatch closes.
          
          Eve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap.
          Safe.
          M-O still stuck in the door.
          Shaking uncontrollably with fear.
          
                                       M-O
                          Whoa.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The WALL-As light up a SMALL WORK SPACE.
          Eve props Wall-E up against some trash.
          He's barely functioning.
          Fades in and out of consciousness.
          Just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.
          
                                                       74.
          
          
          
                                     EVE
                               ("Stay awake.")
                        Wall-E...
          
          Eve gently opens his chest cavity.
          Examines the damage.
          Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD.
          Charred. Shorting out.
          Irreparable.
          She flies off into the depot.
          Searches for a new circuit board.
          
          M-O dutifully cleaning Wall-E.
          Finishes up.
          His DISPLAY POV reads: "All clean."
          M-O closes up. Satisfied.
          Wall-E feebly offers his hand in gratitude.
          
                                          WALL-E
                                 (weak)
                        Wall-E.
          
          M-O stares at the filthy hand.
          Cleans it.
          Then shakes.
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
          They sit in awkward silence for a beat.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Really?)
                        M-O?
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Got it.)
                        M-O.
          
          Eve returns with FOUND CIRCUIT BOARDS.
          Shows each one to Wall-E.
          Will any of these work?
          He shakes his head with a frail "no."
          
          Wall-E opens his compactor.
          Pulls out the plant.
          
                                      WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Di...rec...tive.
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          
          Eve holds the plant.
          Her "RETURN TO AXIOM SUPERIOR" flashes in her display.
          She considers it for a moment...
          ...then tosses the plant to the floor.
          I don't care about the plant anymore.
          She holds her hand out to him.
          
                                        EVE
                        Directive.
          
          Wall-E struggles to lift his hand to Eve's.
          He reaches out...
          
          ...and bats her hand away.
          
          Surprises Eve.
          Wall-E pushes past her.
          Crawls over to the discarded plant.
          Gives it back to Eve.
          
                                        WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Errr.....
          
          Eve can't make out what he is saying.
          Wall-E fumbles around his box.
          Pulls out...
          ...the Zippo lighter.
          Lights it.
          Eve stares at the flame.
          
                                        EVE
                        Earth?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Earth.
          
          He moves his binocular   eyes up and down.
          Like the time he fixed   his broken eye.
          You can fix me, Eve.
          With spare parts in my   truck.
          The truck that is back   on...
          
                                     EVE
                        Earth! Earth!
          
          Her eyes light up.
          She understands!
          No time to lose.
          She scoops him up...
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          
                                         WALL-E
                          M-O?
          
                                         M-O
                                   ("I'm comin'!")
                          Wall-E!
          
          M-O rushes over to Wall-E.

          Hangs onto his IGLOO LATCH with his roller.
          Eve raises her gun arm...
          ...Blasts a HOLE IN THE CEILING.
          Takes off with the two of them.
          Up through the garbage chute.
          The WALL-As wave goodbye.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
          A steward moves down the hall.
          Siren wailing.
          Scans for rogue robots.
          Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen.
          He stops in front of...
          
          A YELLOW LINE
          
          painted haphazardly on the floor.
          Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door.
          
                                         STEWARD
                          Wrong.
          
          The steward opens the closet.
          Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner.
          The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush.
          The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          
          Suddenly, everything begins to shake.
          The steward looks around, confused.
          A JET ENGINE NOISE builds.
          Seems to be coming from...
          
          ...the hallway TRASH CHUTE.
          
          Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it.
          The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E.
          Beeps the POYSC song.
          Our savior has arrived!
          The steward's alarm goes haywire.
          
          ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY
          
          He takes a snapshot:
          Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant...
          
                                                                 77.
          
          
          ...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera.
          
          ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The terrified steward is thrown in.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please hold. We are currently having
                        technical difficul -- !
          
          Eve locks the door on him.
          The trio take off down the hall.
          The freed paint-bot gives chase.
          Cheers POYSC as he follows.
          Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea.
          Presses his PLAY BUTTON.
          POYSC BLARES through the hallway.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music.
          Parade after Eve and Wall-E.
          Hum POYSC.
          All following the pied piper.
          
          ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates.
          Alarms sound.
          Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)

          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto observes the same "Wanted" image.
          
                                     AUTO
                        Not possible.
          
          Raises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM.
          It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location.
          Auto activates every steward on the Axiom.
          
          ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT
          
          Stewards eject from their wall stations.
          Like ATMs jumping to life.
          Race in the direction of Eve.
          Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way.
          
                                                                    78.

          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches the deck plan display.
          Monitors the progress of all the stewards.
          The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to...
          
          THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain, still trapped.
          Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door.
          Has no effect.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (hoarse; exhausted)

                        robots...
          
          A flashing light catches his attention.
          Outside his window.
          He looks up on the SKY DOME...
          A GIANT "WANTED" IMAGE of Eve and Wall-E, holding...
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The plant!
          
          The Captain's eyes light up.
          Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor.
          "Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth"
          He is filled with renewed determination.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Laughs) We'll see who's powerless now.
          
          Lays flat in his chair.
          Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey.
          Pulls off the underside panel.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Ah-Ha!
          
          Yanks out a bundle of wiring.
          Cross-connects two wires.
          The console powers up...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNELS - NIGHT
          
          Eve zooms through the hallways.
          A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them.
          They reach an intersection when...
          
          ...The CAPTAIN'S FACE appears on holo-screens all around
          them.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
          
          ALL AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          All screens display the Captain's live feed.
          He's absolutely everywhere.
          A few stray passengers are still up.
          Watch their screens in confusion.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
          
          Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen.
          Furiously tries to shut off the intercom.
          
          BACK ON EVE AND WALL-E
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm
                        locked in my room. Eve, Wall-E, bring the
                        plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have
                        activated the holo-detector. Now hurry!
                        Auto's probably going to cut me off --
          
          The screens all go dead.
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other with determination.
          They're about to continue on when...
          
          A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
          
                                    STEWARDS
                        Halt.
          
          Dozens of them stand in a row.
          Eve fires her gun. Destroys a steward.
          Another one quickly takes its place.
          Traps her arm with its SUSPENSION BEAM.
          She can't shoot.
          The stewards advance, when suddenly...
          
          ...the Rejects charge the stewards:
          
          ...The beautician-bot deflects rays with her mirrors...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in their faces...
          
                                                                      80.
          
          
          ...The defib-bot shocks them with her paddles...
          ...The umbrella-bot opens up...
          ...Shields the others from the attack...
          
          BEHIND THE UMBRELLA-BOT
          
          A weak Wall-E activates his welding beam.
          Shorts out the Massage-bot's ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          It goes berserk.
          Leaps at the entire army of Stewards.
          Robot parts fly everywhere.
          Eve and Wall-E can't watch the carnage.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          He sets Eve's CYLINDRICAL DEVICE on the floor behind him.
          It projects her stored memories.
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen.
          A MESSAGE SCREEN pops up.
          It's the Captain.
          
          ...and he's holding the plant?
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto!
          
          Auto's single lens irises wide.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Not possible.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it?
                          Come and get it, Blinky!
          
                                      AUTO
                          No.
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen.
          It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT.
          The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E.
          Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Ha ha!
          
          HEARS AUTO coming.
          Turns off the vid-com.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall.
          The room goes dark again.
          
          CLOSE ON CEILING
          
          The aperture opens.
          Auto lowers into the dark.
          Cautiously searches the empty room...
          
                                       AUTO
                          Captain? Captain...?
          
          ON AUTO'S POV
          
          PANS across the portraits of other captains...
          ...past our present Captain...
          ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously...
          -- wait a minute.
          
          The Captain lunges at him.
          Grabs Auto by the steering wheel.
          Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale.
          His lower extremities of no use.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Let go. Let go.
          
          Auto panics.
          Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling.
          The Captain gets stuck between floors...
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          What too heavy for ya, huh?!
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          ...Auto tries to pull free.
          The Captain won't let go.
          Auto ends up yanking him through.
          The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco.
          Auto swings violently back and forth.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          You're not getting away from me, one-eye!
                          -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?!
          
          Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube.
          Sees the Captain fighting Auto.
          Charges at the Captain...
          
          ...who kicks him straight out the window...
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
          Gopher plummets...
          ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL...
          ...and smashes in a heap on the cement.
          The end.
          
          ON WALL-E AND EVE
          
          We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards.
          The massage-bot floats above it all.
          Pants like a wild beast.
          One steward still twitches.
          The massage-bot crushes him with one blow.
          
          Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant.
          They take off for the Concourse Level.
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           That's it!...A little closer!
                           Must..press...button.
          
          The Captain reaches his one free hand out for...
          ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Gotcha! Ha ha!
          
          His hand slams down hard on it.
          KLAXONS sound all over the ship.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          ...Floodlights kick on everywhere...
          ...The LIDO DECK POOLS automatically cover up...
          ...Stray PASSENGERS pause to take in the alarms...
          ...SPACE-LIFE PRESERVERS burst from their hover chairs...
          ...Inflate around their necks...
          ...GREEN LINES appear on the floors...
          ...SLEEPING PASSENGERS are involuntarily led out of their
          cabins...
          ...Every hover chair follows the illuminated lines...
          
          The procedure is completely automated.
          The passengers are all confused.
          Helpless to stop it.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers glide in by the thousands.
          Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools.
          Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          ON JOHN AND MARY
          
          They arrive together at the Lido Deck.
          Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying.
          A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them.
          
                                      NANNY-BOT
                         Remain calm. Remain calm.
          
          CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA
          
          The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates.
          A large cylindrical device rises from the stage...
          
          ...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR.
          
          JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome.
          Show the bridge.
          Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto.
          He tries to speak to them during the fight:
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                                (strained; in command)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your
                         Captain speaking! We're having a slight
                         malfunction with the Autopilot! Please
                         remain calm!
          
          The passengers get caught up in the conflict.
          Treat it as if it were a televised fight.
          
          ON THE REAR OF THE DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel.
          Make a beeline for the holo-detector.
          Ready and waiting for the plant...
          
          ...almost there...
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
                                     AUTO
                         Enough.
          
          Auto furiously spins his wheel.
          Throws the Captain to the floor.
          The entire ship lists dangerously to one side.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side.
          Wall-E drops the plant.
          It tumbles off the bridge plaza.
          Eve is forced to set Wall-E down.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
          He clings to the holo-detector.
          She flies off to retrieve the plant.
          
          The hover chairs stay locked on their lines.
          Passengers all slip off their chairs.
          Their uniform color defaults back to RED.
          Slowly slide across the deck.
          And for the first time...
          ...all of humanity reaches out to one another.
          CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands.
          
          Everyone piles up on the listing side.
          The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity.
          Eve searches desperately amongst them.
          
          ON JOHN & MARY
          
          They hang together off their chairs.
          CRYING TODDLERS just above them.
          The kiddies slip out of their hover rings.
          Mary GASPS in horror.
          Yells to John:
          
                                        MARY
                           John, get ready to have some kids!
          
          They purposefully let go of their chairs.
          Grab hands, forming a human chain.
          Catch the toddlers.
          All slide together down the Lido Deck.
          The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down.
          They land at the bottom, next to Eve.
          
          An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck...
          ...lands on the pool level.
          It begins sliding down the Lido Deck.
          Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.
          
                                           MARY
                                  (Gasp)
                           LOOK OUT!
          
          Eve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them.
          She stops   the car before it hits.
          Struggles   to hold it up.
          Can't let   it crush the passengers below her.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto keeps the ship tilted.
          Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          Switches it off.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                       85.
          
          
          
          The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor...
          Wall-E is still hanging onto it.
          Barely functioning.
          He uses all his strength...
          
          ...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector.
          
          Stops it from disappearing into the floor.
          The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes.
          Something's wrong.
          Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW.
          Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device.
          
                                    AUTO
                           No.
          
          Auto presses down on the "off" button.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him.
          Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up.
          Begins slowly to expand himself...
          
          ...and push the holo-detector back up!!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Jams it into the "off" button.
          Short circuits it.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                           NO!!
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector reverses full force.
          Crushes Wall-E.
          We can't tell if he survived the crush.
          
          Eve calls out for him.
          Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers.
          
          BACK ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed.
          That's it.
          He braces his arms against the floor...
          
                                                                 86.
          
          
          ...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET...
          
          ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN
          
          The passengers collectively GASP.
          Their Captain is standing...
          ...and walking himself up the railing...
          ...towards Auto!
          They CHEER!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto hears the distant cheering.
          Wonders what's up.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                           Auto!
          
          Auto whips around.
          Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly).
          Finds himself face to face with him.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Rushes at him.
          The Captain grabs it. They wrestle.
          The taser ARCS in the Captain's face.
          He flinches. Looks up.
          Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column...
          
          ...and smirks.
          
          The Captain looks Auto in the eye.
          Raises a finger up to the control panel...
          ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON...
          ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL".
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                                  (grits his teeth)
                           Auto, you are relieved of duty.
          
                                       AUTO
                           Noo --
          
          Auto is instantly turned off.
          The Captain smiles triumphantly.
          Grabs the wheel with both hands.
          Makes the ship level again.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers all spill across the deck.
          Shaken but OK.
          Eve sets the monorail down.
          Rockets over to the holo-detector.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          
          Wall-E is pinned under the lip of the holo-detector.
          Eve tries to lift it up.
          It won't budge.
          She looks back to the crowd.
          
                                     EVE
                        PLANT! PLANT!
          
          ON M-O
          
          He searches the crowd for the plant.
          Humans begin to stand for the first time all around him.
          Through his POV he spots the plant mixed in among them.
          "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" flashes on his display screen.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She fights to keep the machine from crushing Wall-E further.
          
                                      M-O (O.S.)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          M-O holds the plant up from across the Lido Deck.
          The vacu-bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger.
          Humans and robots form an impromptu fire line.
          Toss it up to Eve on stage.
          She shoves the plant into the device.
          The detector instantly scans the plant.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)

                        Earth.
          
          Slowly, the holo-detector rises...
          Wall-E topples out from underneath.
          Badly crushed and leaking oil.
          Eve GASPS in horror.
          M-O and the Rejects avert their eyes.
          Passengers recoil as well.
          
          WIDE ON DOME CEILING

          Eve lifts Wall-E up.
          No sign of life.
          
                                      EVE
                        No! WALL-E!!
          
                                                                    88.
          
          
          
          M-O's head drops in despair.
          The passengers witness grief for the first time.
          Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy.
          Mary begins to cry.
          Buries her head in John's shoulder.

                           Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
                           three, two, one, zero.
          
          The ceiling countdown hits "0:00."
          
          
          EXT. AXIOM
          
          The ship jumps to light speed.
          
          BACK INSIDE
          
          The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet.
          Everyone holds on to one another.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          The Captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel.
          Fights the G-forces.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          Humans and robots hang on for dear life.
          John and Mary cling to each other and the babies.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She holds tightly to Wall-E.
          Still calling out his name.
          No response.
          
          ON SPACE
          
          The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.
          
          
          EXT. EARTH - HILLSIDE - DAY
          
          The cockroach waits obediently on the hill.
          Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay.
          His antennae twitch with boredom.
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
          A RED DOT
          
          appears on the ground.
          The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside.
          The ground begins to shake.
          Daylight dims.
          The insect looks to the sky.
          
          ON CLOUD COVER
          
          A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds.
          Blots out the sunlight.
          The Axiom's keel breaks through.
          Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
          
          The cockroach senses his master's return.
          HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him.
          He eagerly chases after them.
          
          ON AXIOM
          
          The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky.
          Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
          
          
          EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT
          
          The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth.
          Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT.
          Thousands of feet deep.
          The ship's keel descends into it.
          The earth shudders.
          Trash towers tumble in the distance.
          
          ...Then all is quiet.
          
          ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM
          
          A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship.
          MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend.
          Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
          
          The Captain walks out gingerly.
          Holding the boot w/ plant.
          The other passengers step out on their own legs.
          Wobble like toddlers.
          They squint up at the harsh sunlight.
          A commotion is heard from the back.
          Somebody trying to push through.
          
          EVE
          
          appears out of the crowd.
          Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
          
                                                                      90.
          
          
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind her.
          They rush across the gangway.
          
          The cockroach meets up with Eve.
          Climbs up onto Wall-E.
          Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding.
          Eve urgently scans the landscape.
          Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance.
          She takes to the air.
          M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Eve! Wait!]
          
          The Captain respectfully removes his hat.
          Good luck, friend.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The interior is dark and still.
          Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens.
          Eve flies inside with Wall-E.
          Sets him on the floor.
          
          She scans the rotating shelves at high speed.
          Grabs a CAR JACK.
          Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body...
          
          QUICK SHOTS
          
          ...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve...
          ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E...
          ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion...
          ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece...
          ...She opens his new solar panels...
          
          ...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun.
          
          OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY
          
          The rejects stop.
          See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode.
          Oh no.
          
          BACK IN THE TRUCK
          
          A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E.
          Eve holds her breath, watches...
          Waits...
          
          ...Beep...
          ...Beep...
          
                                                                       91.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E (O.S.)
                        (Apple "reboot" SFX)
          
          Wall-E's meter fully charges.
          His head slowly rises from his box.
          Blinks.
          The cockroach hops with joy.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          ...She holds out her hand to him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (with love)
                        Wall-E...
          
          Wall-E gives her a blank stare.
          He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck.
          She grabs him.
          Turns him back around.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (It's me!)
                        Eve!
          
          Wall-E just stares.
          Doesn't seem to know who she is.
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Here, look at these.]
          
          She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf.
          The light bulb glows in her hand.
          She gives them to Wall-E.
          No reaction.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Remember?)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
          
                                        EVE
                               (hums)
                        [I know!]
          
          She hovers over to the video player.
          Plays HELLO DOLLY.
          Looks back to see if it has any effect.
          
          Wall-E is over at the shelves.
          Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor.
          Crushes them into a cube.
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                                                 92.
          
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Runs over the cockroach on his way out.
          The insect pops back to life.
          Watches his friend in shock.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile.
          Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube.
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Still in disbelief.
          
                                    EVE
                              (somber)
                        No.
          
          Wall-E continues to stack his cubes.
          She stops him.
          Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes.
          Nobody home.
          Eve presses his "play" button.
          Nothing but STATIC.
          Eve begins to panic.
          Shakes him.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
          
          No response.
          He's gone.
          She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
          
          Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand.
          Forces his fingers to interlace with hers.
          Holds him close one last time.
          Leans her head against his.
          Hums softly.
          
                                       EVE
                        [Hums IOTAM]
          
          She touches her forehead to his.
          Goodbye Wall-E.
          A TINY SPARK between them.
          
          Eve turns to hover away.
          Jerked back.
          Her fingers caught between his.
          She checks his eyes again.
          Nothing.
          
          But then...
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          ...a tiny SERVO NOISE.
          She looks down at their hands.
          
          CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
          
          They start to move.
          Slowly close around Eve's.
          
          She looks back at his face.
          Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus.
          His brows raise...
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah?
          
                                       EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          He notices their hands entwined.
          His dream come true.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (amazed)
                         Ee-vah!!
          
          She giggles.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK
          
          The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
          
          "And that is all that love's about..."
          
          BACK OUTSIDE
          
          Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes.
          M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck.
          They begin to celebrate.
          Wall-E's alive!
          Then M-O realizes they need privacy.
          Herds the Rejects O.S.
          
                                      M-O
                         Go! Go, go go!
          
          Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch.
          Together now and ever more.
          
          "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          CLOSE UP OF THE PLANT
          
                                                                  94.
          
          
          
          Newly planted in the earth.
          Small hands water it gently.
          PULL OUT to reveal it surrounded by kids.
          The Captain instructs them.
          John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom.
          Robots and passengers stream off the ship.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        This is called "farming"! You kids are
                        going to grow all kinds of plants:
                        vegetable plants, pizza plants!
                               (laughs)
                        Ahh, it's good to be home...
          
          The CAMERA PULLS OUT from the Axiom...
          ...over the bay...
          
          "...That it only took a moment..."
          
          ...past Wall-E & Eve holding hands in his truck...
          ...over M-O and the Rejects cleaning outside...
          ...Through the trash towers of the city...
          ...past a FIELD OF PLANTS, sprouting from its peak...

               [Showing Pictures of City Life]


                                     NARRATOR

                         No one would have believed in the early 
                         years of the21st century, that our world 
                         was being watched by intelligences greater 
                         than our own. That as men busied themselves 
                         about their various concerns, they observed 
                         and studied. Like the way a man with 
                         a microscope might scrutinize the creatures 
                         that swarm and multiply in a drop of 
                         water. With infinite complacency men 
                         went to and fro about the globe, confident 
                         of our empire over this world. Yet, 
                         across the gulf of space, intellects, 
                         vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded 
                         our plant with envious eyes. And slowly 
                         and surely, drew their plans against

               Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears 
               his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't 
               slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground 
               loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating 
               the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down 
               the stairs.

                         Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!


               Ray turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is 
               going to say.

 
                                     SAL

                         I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 
                         I got half of Korea coming in.

 
                                     RAY

                         No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour 
                         blow! Call Tadesko. 

 
               Camera follows them walking down the street.


                                     SAL

                         Tadesko can't move 40 containers in 
                         an hour. I need somebody who can do 
                         double picks.

 
                                     RAY

                         I wish I could help you Sal. God damn 
                         union regulations.

 
                                     SAL

                         (getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position 
                         here!

 
                                     RAY

                         Come on, you remember the union regulations, 
                         Sal.
 
                                     SAL

                         (angrily) You know what your problem 
                         is?

 
               Sal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (joking) I can think of a couple of 
                         women who'd be happy to tell you. 

 
                         
               EXT. RAY'S CAR - DRIVEWAY - DAWN


               Ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as 
               Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair, 
               extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife 
               Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair 
               hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie 
               (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes 
               (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.) 
               and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing, 
               long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         Is it 8:30? We say that?


                                     MARY ANN

                         We said 8:00.


                                     RAY

                         (changing subject) Hey, this is one 
                         safe looking vehicle you got yourself 
                         here Tim. Congratulations.

 
                                     TIM

                         Thank You.


                                     RAY

                         8 o'clock huh?


                                     MARY ANN

                         Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday, 
                         depending on the traffic.

 
               Robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the 
               electrical pole. He is listening to his MP3 player at a loud 
               enough volume for the camera (10' away to hear).

 
                                     RAY

                         There he is! You got a hug?


               Robbie ignores him as if he was not there and heads up to the 
               front door of the house.

 
                                     RAY

                         (continues) Confusing handshake? (joking) 
                         Kick in the teeth? The door's locked. 
                         (to Mary Ann): Still working on those 
                         manners?

 
               Mary Ann nods "yes" as Rachel gets out of the car.


                                     RACHEL

                         Hello dad.


                                     RAY

                         Hello, Rachel!


               Rachel gives him a hug and goes back to the car to retrieve her 
               bag. She struggles and Mary Ann, Tim, and Ray try to help which 
               results in a small bicker argument. (Ray, Tim, and Mary Ann add 
               lib.)

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (during bickering, at the front door) 
                         The door's locked.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (suit case in hand) I'll just get it 
                         in the door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         It's got rollers, just roll it.


                                     MARY ANN

                         Well we can't roll it up the stairs 
                         now can we?

 
                                     RAY

                         Really, I got it from here, okay?

 
                         
               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN


               Mary Ann, Rachel, Ray, and Tim walk into the kitchen as Robbie 
               heads straight upstairs to his room. Mary Ann sees a car engine 
               next to the kitchen table and looks at Ray in disgust. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be 
                         out of here next week.

 
               Mary Ann walks over to the refrigerator to check for the basic 
               food supplies. Ray gets frustrated that she is going through 
               HIS stuff.

 
                                     RAY

                         (trying to get her to leave) You better 
                         get going if you want to beat the traffic, 
                         don't you think?

 
               Mary Ann ignores his comment as she opens the refrigerator which 
               is almost empty. 

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         You're out of milk. (smells it) And 
                         everything else.

 
               Shot of Rachel, intensely listening from the stairs.


                                     RAY

                         (mad) Would you close the door please? 
                         Now that that's my refrigerator.

 
                         
                                     TIM

                         I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel) 
                         I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see 
                         you in a few days.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Bye Tim.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I'd better get this upstairs.


               Ray tries to further rid of her but she continues.


                                     RACHEL

                         (trying to get her bag form Mary Ann) 
                         Mom, Mom!

 
                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann, let me get this.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I can get it.


                                     RAY

                         (rushes to close his bedroom door, as 
                         if hiding something) Excuse me.

 
               Ray gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's 
               room.

 
               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RACHEL AND ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAWN


               Mary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his 
               bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed.

 
               
                                     MARY ANN

                         A little old to still be sharing aren't 
                         they?

 
                                     RAY

                         I don't hear any complaints.


                                     MARY ANN

                         No, I do.


               Mary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player. 
               She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down 
               on a desk chair.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie 
                         to make sure he's listening) ...on the 
                         French occupation of Algeria due Monday 
                         which he's yet to begin. It would be 
                         nice if he were done by the time we 
                         got back so we don't have to keep him 
                         up all night on Sunday.

 
               Mary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says...


                                     ROBBIE

                         I just got to type it up. (makes typing 
                         motion)

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         No, you just got to start writing it 
                         first.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (interrupts her) I love you mom!


               Mary Ann kisses him.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I love you. (begins walking over to 
                         Rachel) Listen to your father.

 
               Mary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices...


                                     MARY ANN

                         Oh, no shoes on the bed.

                         We'll be at my parent's house in Boston 
                         but don't call the house line, because 
                         you know. Well the point is I've got 
                         my cell phone. So if anything comes 
                         up, or if you have any questions just 
                         call.

 
                                     RAY

                         Believe it or not, I can handle it.

 
                         
                                     MARY ANN

                         you.

 
               Mary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops 
               to say...

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         You think?

                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about. 
                         Listen, you tell your mother that Ray 
                         sends his love and kisses.

               Robbie is watching the TV stories about lighting storms in other 
               parts of the world. Channel changes ever few seconds. Ray turns 
               off the TV and throws Robbie's baseball mitt at him. He catches 
               it and says...

                         it is? (no response from Robbie) That's 
                         how it's gonna be?

                         Careful with that throw.

                         on that when you're done here.

 
               During next lines (until noted) they throw the ball back and 
               fourth.

                         Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got 
                         to type it up.

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, bullshit!


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah, and what do you know Ray?


                                     RAY

                         Everything. Haven't you heard? Between 
                         me and my brother, we know everything.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         What's the capital of Australia?


                                     RAY

                         That's one my brother knows.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Is it okay with you if I just laugh 
                         the first 500 times you tell that one.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Just do your report. We don't send you 
                         to school so you can flunk out.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         You don't pay for it, Tim does.


               Ray throws the ball at Robbie hard enough to knock dust off his 
               mitt. Robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth 
               in pain.

 
                                     RAY

                         That's half of what I've got.


                                     ROBBIE

                         You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         That why you act like such a dick?

 
                         
               Ray throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a 
               window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up 
               the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares 
               back.

 
                                     RAY

                         What?


                                     RACHEL

                         That's not how you're going to get through 
                         to him. You want him to listen to you...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts her) What are you? Your 
                         mother or mine?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where are you going?


                                     RAY

                         To sleep. I work for a living.


                                     RACHEL

                         What are we supposed to eat?


                                     RAY

                         You know, order.


               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - DAWN


               Ray takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and 
               takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep. 
               

 
               INT Ray's House - Living room -  Day


               Rachel is flipping TV channels as Ray walks down the hall after 
               his nap. He sits down and sees Rachel picking at a splinter. 
               Rachel has his hard hat on.

 
                                     RAY

                         What's the matter?


                                     RACHEL

                         I got a splinter.


                                     RAY

                         Where'd you get it. Come here.


                                     RACHEL

                         On your porch railing.


                                     RAY

                         What, you want me to... (beat) You want 
                         me to take that out for you?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Absolutely not!


                                     RAY

                         Well, come here let me see it.


               Rachel shows him but doesn't let him touch it for fear he may 
               pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and 
               he looks at it.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's gonna get infected.


                                     RACHEL

                         No it wont.


                                     RAY

                         Yes, it's gonna get infected.


                                     RACHEL

                         No, it won't. When it's ready, my body 
                         will just push it out. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Push it out?


                                     RACHEL

                         I read that. (as she sits back down) 
                         You should get TiVo. Tim got it for 
                         my room. It's awesome. I can watch all 
                         my shows after homework.

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum 
                         card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?

 
                         
               Ray takes a bite of the food sitting on the coffee table in front 
               of him, having no idea what it is.

 
                                     RAY

                         (with the disgusting food in his mouth) 
                         What is that?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Hummus.


                                     RAY

                         Hummus?


                                     RACHEL

                         From the health food place. I kept one 
                         of their menus last time we were here. 
                         

 
               Ray gives Rachel a "this is gross" look and she gawks at him.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         Uh, you said order!


                                     RAY

                         (laughs) I meant order food! Where is 
                         Robbie?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         He went out.


                                     RAY

                         Out where?


                                     RACHEL

                         I don't know. He just took your car 
                         and left.

 
               EXT Ray's House - Front Driveway - Day


               He glances at his open garage door with the car that should have 
               been in it. He runs across the street to search for his car. 
               As he sees everyone else looking at the sky, he looks himself 
               to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of 
               it. The cloud is swirling as if it was being artificially turned.

 
               
                                     FRIEND 1

                         You ever see something like that?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (scratching his chin) In the springtime 
                         maybe. Not this time of year. Come on, 
                         we can see better from the back yard.

 
                         
               (continuous) EXT Ray's House - Back Yard - Day


               Ray runs by the fence to his back yard. As he runs, the wind 
               starts to pick up. 30-40 mph. 

 
                                     RAY

                         That is so weird.

                         What?


                                     RAY

                         The wind is blowing toward the storm. 
                         

 
                                     FRIEND 2

                         That is weird.


               Winds pick up faster. 40-50 mph.


                                     RAY

                         Rachel, wanna see something cool?

 

                Rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear. 
                Pan up to view the 'storm' that appears to be lighting up with 
                multiple colored lights. Wide angle shot of clothes blowing in
                the wind. Suddenly the wind dies down to nothing. Lightning hits
                the pavement about 300 feet away.


                                     RAY

                         It's okay.


                                     RACHEL

                         I want to go inside.


                                     RAY

                         It's okay.


                                     RACHEL

                         I want to go inside.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, you go ahead.


               The friend's baby starts to cry...


                                     FRIEND 2

                         That's enough weather for me. (begins 
                         walking inside)

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I don't want to go by myself.


               BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and 
               louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house. 
               BAM! The lighting continues. BAM!

 
                                     RAY

                         Kind of fun, ain't it?


                                     RACHEL

                         No.


                                     RAY

                         Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of 
                         July.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         No it's not.


               Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder 
               and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. 
               BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! 
               Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING 
               continues.

 
               INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day


               Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs 
               into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes 
               Rachel scream.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's okay. You're fine.


                                     RACHEL

                         It hit right behind our house.


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there 
                         again because lighting doesn't strike 
                         twice in the same place.

 
               BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump.


                                     RAY

                         Oh, SHIT!


               They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. 
               They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes 
               on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor 
               under the table as the lighting goes on.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where's Robbie?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know.


                                     RACHEL

                         Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you 
                         okay?

 
               BAM! The lighting continues.


                                     RAY

                         Where's the thunder?


                                     RACHEL

                         Why won't it stop?


               Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all 
               is silent.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (with hesitation) Is it over?


               Ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the 
               lightening came from. Ray climbs out from under the table to 
               get an idea of what just happened.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where are you going?


                                     RAY

                         Just checking things out. Just wait, 
                         wait there.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Are we going to be okay?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know.


                                     RACHEL

                         You don't know.


                                     RAY

                         No. I meant... Rachel, please, just 
                         stop asking so many questions. Just 
                         wait here.

 
               Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything 
               is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then 
               walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power. 
               He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone 
               which also appears to not work at all. He sees his watch which 
               has also stopped working. 

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD AREA - EVENING


               Pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots. 
               

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - FRONT STREET - EVENING


               Ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and 
               for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working. 
               By now we get the picture (EMP). He walks out onto the sidewalk 
               where he is joined by his friend.

 
                                     FRIEND 2

                         You believe this Ray? Every single car.

 
                         
               Ray walks past her onto the street where he sees ROBBIE walking 
               up the street towards him. Ray begins running towards him.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. 


                                     ROBBIE

                         The car just stopped and...


                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) You're okay? Are you 
                         okay?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         ... and the lighting started hitting 
                         about a block away over and over again. 
                         And me and this other guy we...

 
                                     RAY

                         (getting angry) Where the hell'd you 
                         go?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ... 
                         by the church.

 
                                     RAY

                         Did you see it? Did you... Were you 
                         near it?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and 
                         over the lighting started hitting. It 
                         opened up this hole or something...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         26 times?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, you're okay?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah.


                                     RAY

                         Good, because your sister is in the 
                         house, I want you to go in that house 
                         and I want you to stay with her. Okay? 
                         (break, as he starts running down the 
                         street) And the next time you take my 
                         car with no driver's license and no 
                         permission, I call the cops. You better 
                         be there when I get back. 

 
               Robbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie. (snaps his hands together)

 
                         
               Ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards 
               away.

 
                                     RAY

                         Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it, 
                         dead?

 
                                     MANNY

                         All of them, everything, look at this... 
                         (taps the starter motor) starter's fried. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         Lightning hit it? 


                                     MANNY

                         Not even close. I thought if I changed 
                         it... you got any idea what's going 
                         on?

 
                                     RAY

                         I'm on my way to find out. Try umm... 
                         try changing the solenoids.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right 
                         see, I told you that, the solenoids.

 
                         
               Everyone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what 
               went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the 
               lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk 
               by.

 
                                     COP 1

                         Let us through. Let us through here.

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Hey, what up, Ray?


                                     RAY

                         (joking) I should of known you two were 
                         behind this.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor 
                         hood 

 
                                     RAY

                         Can you blame him?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         You see it?


                                     RAY

                         Yep, you got power where you are?

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Nope, nothing.


                                     RAY

                         It's the cars though. That's the thing.

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Solar Flare, that's what this guy told 
                         me. 

 
                                     RAY

                         A solar flare?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, 
                         they turn into solar flare flashes. 
                         It's the only thing that can kill all 
                         of the electronic stuff.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Can I say something?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         What bro?


                                     FRIEND 3

                         The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Bro, I'm just telling you what that 
                         guy said he heard.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         I know but it just sounds dumb saying 
                         that...

 
               Ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where 
               everyone else is gathered around. 

 
                                     COP 1

                         I never seen anything like this before. 
                         That many strikes of lighting in one 
                         spot.

 
               The cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Is this the only place?


               Ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt 
               crumbs. He switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold 
               to hold in one hand.

 
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Is it hot?


                                     RAY

                         No. It's freezing.


               The police officers and the other people gathered around feel 
               a vibration under their feet.

 
                                     COP 2

                         What is that?


                                     RAY

                         You feel that?


                                     FRIEND 3

                         Yeah, I feel that.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         What is it the subway?


                                     COP 1

                         There's no subway here.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         PATH Train maybe?


                                     COP 1

                         That can't be the water main. 


                                     COP 2

                         There's nothing else down there.


                                     COP 1

                         The water main doesn't run through here.

 
                         
                                     COP 2

                         Well, there's something down there and 
                         it's moving.

 
               The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start 
               running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows 
               start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even 
               more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone 
               on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering 
               windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and 
               moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement 
               lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something 
               throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the 
               air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The 
               police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the 
               ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes 
               out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide 
               behind a building. 

 
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Oh my god.


               Ray begins walking out from behind the building.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         Ray, no, stay man.


               The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to 
               other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. 
               People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the 
               beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding 
               into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous 
               beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again 
               Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. 
               He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator 
               beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides 
               behind a building as the machine walks by.

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING


               Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking 
               eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking 
               at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the 
               kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With 
               anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         What happened?


               Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the 
               kitchen, not responding.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What's going on?


               Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on 
               the stool at the island.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad, what's the matter?


                                     ROBBIE

                         What's all that stuff all over you?

 
                         
               Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie.

                         Rachel reaches through a leg of the 
                         island to pull at Ray's hood on his 
                         shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his 
                         head toward Rachel fast enough to make 
                         some of the white powder poof off as 
                         if jerked back into reality. Robbie 
                         jumps as well in fright.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What's all the stuff?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Hello? Ray?


               Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He 
               gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive 
               to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to 
               see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly 
               does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing 
               it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.

 
               Walking back into the kitchen...


                                     RAY

                         We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

 
                         
               Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He 
               shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over 
               at the force Ray used.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (questioning) What? Wait. I have no 
                         idea what's going on...

 
                                     RAY

                         (while Robbie asks) ... all the food 
                         from the refrigerator and the cupboard, 
                         put it in here.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         I think we are having a bit of a shock 
                         here...what's going on, just tell me...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Just do it.


               Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try 
               to get it to work.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel, sweetheart... 


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad, you're really scaring me.


                                     RAY

                         I need you to get your suitcase...

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad. (break) Dad!


                                     RAY

                         The one that you brought, bring it to 
                         me, okay?

 
               Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the 
               refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he 
               realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.

 
                                     RAY

                         Can you do that for me, darling?


               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - EVENING


               Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs. 
               He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains 
               a hand gun. He tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds 
               his shirts over it.

 
               Street Sidewalk - Evening


               Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down 
               the sidewalk with about 20 other people around them. Rachel is 
               clutching Ray's hand and Robbie is carrying the box of food. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         What's happening?


                                     RAY

                         Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We... 
                         We've only got about another minute.

 
                         
               Ray sees the car that Manny was working on just as Manny's Apprentice 
               closes the hood. Ray mutters...

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, Please, Please.


               People are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction. 
               Ray, Robbie and Rachel approach the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         Just keep it down.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Ray, I'm standing right beside you. 
                         Can you please answer me?

 
               Ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Just get in the front seat Robbie.

 
                         
               Ray loads Rachel in the middle row of seats as Robbie gets in 
               the passenger seat.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Who's car is this?


                                     RAY

                         Just get in.


                                     RACHEL

                         Who's car is this?


               Ray throws Rachel's bag in the row of seats behind her, slams 
               the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car. He 
               is caught by Manny walking.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right. 
                         I had to change the sole... Ray?

 
                         
               Manny sees Ray has loaded his whole family into the car.


                                     MANNY

                         Hey Ray? Ray? What? 


               Manny walks over to the passenger side as Ray and Robbie watch 
               him.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Ray. Open up.


               Ray, who did no such thing sits there. Robbie looks at ray wondering 
               what he's going to do.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR 
                         RAY!

 
               Ray reaches over Robbie and opens the door.


                                     MANNY

                         What are you...


                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) Get in.


                                     MANNY

                         That's funny, you gotta get out of the 
                         car. You can't take it.

 
               Ray tries to get Manny to calm down from the panic he is in...

 
               
                                     MANNY

                         It's not my car. It's not your car. 
                         Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy 
                         kids. Guy's gonna come back...

 
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) I don't have time to 
                         expl....

 
                                     MANNY

                         (interrupts him) You're busting my chops. 
                         I got a shop to run. You know how many 
                         people...

 
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) Get in!


                                     MANNY

                         No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...


                                     RAY

                         GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

 
                         
               Rachel begins crying as she says...


                                     RACHEL

                         What do you mean?


               A dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in 
               fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other.

 
                                     MANNY

                         All right, get out of the truck! I'm 
                         not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR 
                         RAY!

 
               Rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame 
               at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the 
               flaming tree.

 
                                     MANNY

                         I'm not fooling around, I got a busy 
                         day ahead of me...

 
                                     RAY

                         (to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!

 
                         
               Ray helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding 
               away.

 
                                     MANNY

                         RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT 
                         MY CAR!

 
               Manny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator 
               beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding 
               to smithereens. 

 
               INT. CAR - DUSK


               Trying to outrun the beams...


                                     RAY

                         GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!


                                     RACHEL

                         Is this the terrorists?!?!


                                     RAY

                         JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!


               Ray grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward 
               the floor.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET DOWN!


                                     ROBBIE

                         HOLY SHIT!


               High shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away. 
               The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses 
               below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker 
               falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris 
               flies all over behind the van.

 
               The van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars 
               are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by 
               them honking the horn every few cars.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Where are we going?!?!?!


                                     RAY

                         We gotta go! We got to be the only working 
                         car around here. I'm not stopping until 
                         we are clear. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         CLEAR OF WHAT?!?! 


                                     RAY

                         We gotta go.


                                     ROBBIE

                         WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?


                                     RAY

                         YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!


               Rachel begins frantically crying. After a few seconds, she begins 
               hyperventilating. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep 
                         it down Rachel!

 
               After honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten 
               worse.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         (with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING 
                         HER OUT!!

 
                                     RAY

                         WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!

 
                         
               Robbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm Rachel. He 
               thinks of an old technique he was taught.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Okay, (slapping his arms together on 
                         top of each other, demonstrating) Put 
                         em' up Rache.

 
               Rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows 
                         so she holds the position. He begins 
                         to calm her down) This space right here, 
                         this is yours.

 
               Robbie stares directly into her eyes. She takes deep breaths 
               to regain control. She is able to open her eyes and stare back 
               into his eyes to maintain contact.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         ... This belongs to you, right? 


                                     RACHEL

                         (panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) You're safe in your 
                         space. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my 
                         space.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) You're safe in your 
                         space. Nothing is going to happen to 
                         you in your space. 

 
               Ray looks back into the back seat in amazement at Robbie able 
               to do what he's doing.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm really scared.


                                     ROBBIE

                         I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk 
                         to dad...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         No....


                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) I will be two feet 
                         away. Okay.

 
               Rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing 
               while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Will you hold my hand?


                                     RACHEL

                         Yes.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Are you gonna be okay?


                                     RACHEL

                         (relatively calm) Yes.


               Robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (taking a breath to calm himself) I 
                         want to know everything you know.

 
                         
               Ray looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward 
               on the road.

 
                                     RAY

                         This thing, this machine, it crawled 
                         out of the ground and started torching 
                         everything, just killing everybody.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         No, this came from some place else.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         You mean like Europe?


                                     RAY

                         NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!


               Ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the 
               driver's side.

 
                                     RAY

                         That machine, it was already buried. 
                          

 
               Ray looks into the sky. What for is unknown.


                                     RAY

                         Maybe it came down in the lightning 
                         storm. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Wait a minute... you just said it was 
                         buried.

 
                                     RAY

                         No, the machine I'm talking about was 
                         buried. But, what came down in the lighting 
                         storm, what operates it. That's the... 
                         that's the.... You know. The....

 
                         
               Robbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots 
               forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky. 

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         The what?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Why aren't there any helicopters or 
                         airplanes?

 
                                     RAY

                         Hey Rache. How you doing there girl? 
                         (to Robbie) How she doing?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         How you doing?


                                     RACHEL

                         I'm fine.


                                     ROBBIE

                         (to Ray) She's good.


                                     RAY

                         Good.  Hey, what was that thing you 
                         did with her?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         Hey Rachel


                                     RACHEL

                         I want mom.


                                     RAY

                         I know. You feel better?


                                     RACHEL

                         I want mom.


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, tell me about it, you know?

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         Take me to Mom's!


                                     RAY

                         Listen, I just need you to hold it together 
                         for me, okay?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I WANT MOM!!!


                                     RAY

                         When you start screaming like that, 
                         you know, I can't really...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM!!!


               Robbie gets back into the back seat to repeat the "arms" process 
               with her to calm her again.

 
                                     RAY

                         I know...


                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!


                                     RAY

                         That's where we're going right now.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!


                                     RAY

                         I KNOW!!


               EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DUSK


               Still in the car...


                                     RACHEL

                         Come on, hurry up Dad...


               As soon as the van stops, Robbie gets out and opens the door 
               for Rachel.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks 
                         on it)

 
               Robbie grabs the keys off his belt loop as Rachel begins running 
               up to the front door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (begins, and continues once in the house) 
                         MOM! TIM!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (begins, and continues once in the house) 
                         MOM!! TIM!!

 
               Ray remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is 
               (kids are shouting for Tim).

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK


               Rachel and Robbie are shouting for "mom" and "Tim" as Ray walks 
               through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from 
               different parts of the house in their search. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         They're gone.


                                     RACHEL

                         Is she dead??


                                     RAY

                         She's not dead. All right? She's just 
                         no here. Okay? They're never here.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         How do you know?


                                     RAY

                         Because they are on their way to Boston....

 
                         
               The camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie. 
               Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next 
               to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim.

 
                                     RAY

                         ... and so they just kept on going, 
                         they're probably up to your grandma's 
                         house by now.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         How come the lights are on here and 
                         not at your place?

 
                                     RAY

                         Umm.... Because nothing bad happened 
                         here. Okay?

 
               Robbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out 
               of the phone.

 
                                     RAY

                         So, were safe here. All Right?


               Remembering Robbie's calming "arm" technique...


                                     RAY

                         Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay, 
                         you are safe in your area...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad. That's not how it goes.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get 
                         you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get 
                         something to eat.  (digs into the box) 
                         What do we have here??

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         .. Busy signals, one of the fast ones.... 
                         You think all the circuits are down?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco, 
                         Barbeque Sauce. This is really good 
                         Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food. 
                         What... What the hell is this?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         That's all that was in your kitchen.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right. 
                         

 
               Robbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box 
               for food. He finds peanut butter. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the 
                         bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm.... 
                         We'll just get some sandwiches.

 
               Ray takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole 
               loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm 
               Rachel and Robbie.

 
                                     RAY

                         You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal? 
                         Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie, 
                         two for me, (he has one extra in his 
                         hand) ...one for the house. (laughs) 
                         

 
               Ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the 
               cooking utensil holder on the counter.

 
                                     RAY

                         Maybe after we get done eating, I will

               Robbie shakes his head yes to her statement.

                         Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two 
                         pieces of bread) You can eat the bread. 
                         Okay?

                         Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to 
                         be eating peanut butter sandwiches. 
                         (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?

                         You're not hungry either? Well, that's 
                         fine.

 
               Ray picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window. 
               One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides 
               off.

 
                                     RAY

                         Everybody just relax, okay? Because 
                         we are here now and we're safe, and 
                         we're gonna stay.  And in the morning 
                         your mom and Tim are going to be here 
                         and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? 
                         (no responses) Okay.

               Rachel and Ray are running down the stars carrying their own 
               pillows and blankets. Robbie follows slightly behind them carrying 
               his own and a few extra pillows and blankets.

                         when there's a tornado, and they tell 
                         you to go to the basement for safety? 
                         It's like that.

                         Rachel, no more talking.


               Robbie puts his hat on Rachel's head and ushers her over to the 
               spot under the stairs where blankets are laid out. Ray walks 
               over to the chair about five feet away from the bed.

               Rachel and Robbie are heard in the background...

                         Love you, Rache.


               Ray takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa 
               as he sits down. So Robbie and Rachel wont notice.

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT


               Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder 
               and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy 
               of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets 
               Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash 
               is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to 
               Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening 
               starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting 
               lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought 
               the stairs.

 
               A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his 
               breathing becomes more erratic.

                                     RAY

                         No, this is something else...


               Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine 
               begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. 
               Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up 
               to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves 
               everywhere. 

 
               A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even 
               louder.

                         IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!!


               The lighting grows more intense as does the sound.


                                     RAY

                         WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE, 
                         THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO??

 
                         
               Robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows Rachel down 
               the stairs who runs. Robbie goes back to get Ray.

 
               Ray realizes he has forgotten his gun.


                                     RAY

                         WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! 


               Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through 
               the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first 
               door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages, 
               after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of 
               the furnace room. 

 
               The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark, 
               you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around 
               them.

               Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding 
               on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges 
               it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. 

 
               He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping 
               against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in 
               pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds 
               most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top 
               floor because the second floor was completely torn off. 

 
               The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane 
               engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the 
               remains of different sections of an airplane. 

 
               EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - YARD - DAWN


               Ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue 
               cart through the aisle.

               The man continues hauling the cart.

               The cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps 
               down the floor to the ground.

               van in the background.

                         beside him. The camera on his shoulder 
                         saved his life. (to Max) You hear that 
                         Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid

                         Out there in the pine barrens. We were

                         those things around midnight. They've 
                         got some kind of shield around them. 
                         We can't see it, but everything we fire 
                         at them detonates too early before we 
                         can get close enough to cause any damage. 
                         When they flash that thing, everything

                         machines come up from under the ground, 
                         right? That means they must have been 
                         buried there a long time ago. So who's

               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAWN


               Ray is talking to Rachel...


                                     RAY

                         Look at me. Look at me. 


               Rachel and Ray are putting on their coats.


                                     RAY

                         You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?

 
                         
               Rachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes.


                                     RAY

                         Don't look down, don't look around me. 
                         I'm taking you to the car and you're 
                         gonna want to look around. But you are 
                         not going to, are you?

 
               She shakes her head and whispers "no".


               INT. (BUT DUE TO CRASH IT IS NOW EXT.) MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DEBRIS 
               FIELD - DAWN

 
               Ray is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind 
               them looking at the devastation.

 
                                     RAY

                         You're doing good. You're doing good. 
                         Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right 
                         to Boston, and we're gonna see your 
                         mom. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm not gonna look, dad.


                                     RAY

                         That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay, 
                         listen, I want you to close your eyes. 
                         Got them closed? 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Um-Huh. 


                                     RAY

                         There you go. Keep em' closed for me.

 
                         
               Camera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment 
               of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to 
               pull out. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie, get in. 


               Robbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated. 


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         Why are you yelling?


               Ray gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get 
                         in!

 
               They pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey.

 
               
               EXT. VAN - DAY


               Ray is reading the map while Robbie looks out the window. They 
               are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Because I don't want everybody to see 
                         we've got a working car. (going over 
                         the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson 
                         until we find an open bridge or ferry, 
                         then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then 
                         take the back roads across Connecticut 
                         all the way to Boston. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where is everybody?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding 
                         in their basements. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         If we had any balls, we'd go back there 
                         and find one of those things and kill 
                         it. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, well, why don't you just let me 
                         make the big decisions, okay?

 
               Ray shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry 
               at Robbie.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's 
                         about your speed.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Okay, enough Robbie!


                                     RAY

                         (angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray 
                         shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want 
                         Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird 
                         to me but you decide.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Yes, Rachel.


                                     RACHEL

                         I have to go to the bathroom.


                                     RAY

                         Really?


               Rachel shakes her head "yes" as he pulls the car over.


               Ray grabs Robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car. He 
               glares at Rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which 
                         Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!

 
                                     RAY

                         Not so fast, not so fast, all right? 
                         Now, there are two things we have to 
                         watch out for, and the second is people 
                         who might want our car. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         There's nobody around!


                                     RACHEL

                         I gotta go.


               Robbie breaks free of Ray's grasp on his sleeve. Robbie and Rachel 
               both get out of the car. Ray follows the both of them to supervise 
               the whole event from the van.

 
                                     RAY

                         (displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's 
                         good right there. (points to a spot 
                         20' away)

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         All right, then just go where I can 
                         see you!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!!


                                     RAY

                         I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         THAT'S LOOKING!!


               Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie 
               has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under 
               the road. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Listen. Every time you don't listen 
                         to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? 
                         I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm 
                         making a list!

 
               Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking 
               for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it 
               in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES 
               start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down 
               the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes 
               up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs 
               her. 

 
                                     RAY

                         I told you to stay where I could see 
                         you!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm sorry!


               Ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van.

 
               
               Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only 
               interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity 
               to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!

 
                         
               Some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!! 
                         GIVE ME A HAND!!!

 
               Robbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large 
               puddles of water. Robbie is not giving up hope that one may let 
               him on. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU 
                         HAVE ROOM!!!

 
                                     SOLDIER

                         Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF 
                         RUN OVER!!!

 
               Ray sees Robbie trying to get on with them. He has had enough 
               of Robbie and goes up to him to tell him....

 
                                     RAY

                         WHAT!?!?!  ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN 
                         THAT DIRECTION?

 
               Robbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         THERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION, 
                         ROBBIE!!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE 
                         A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         OKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE 
                         IN CHARGE NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE 
                         DOING!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WE CATCH UP WITH THESE SOLDIERS, WE 
                         PICK UP WHOEVER ELSE ISN'T DEAD AND 
                         WE GET BACK AT THEM!!! WE GET BACK AT 
                         THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!!

 
                                     RAY

                         WELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T 
                         INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING 
                         THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT???

 
                         
               Ray and Robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each 
               other as the tanks continue rolling by.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH???

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT!


                                     ROBBIE

                         YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         YOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!! 
                         YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE 
                         MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU 
                         CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US 
                         ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE 
                         ABOUT YOURSELF!!! WITCH IS EXACTLY THE 
                         WAY YOU LIKE IT!!!

 
               Robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline 
               keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air 
               from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as 
               an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?! 
                         WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!

 
               Rachel begins to cry as Robbie looks at her in sorrow. 


                                     RACHEL

                         WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU 
                         GO!!!

 
               Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks 
               her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to 
               the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this 
               brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the 
               divorce of their parents.

 
               INT. VAN - DAY


               Robbie is staring out the window in the exact opposite direction 
               of Ray. The radio is broadcasting the emergency alert test. Ray 
               turns off the radio and says...

 
                                     RAY

                         If I close my eyes, why don't you drive 
                         for a bit.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         I don't have a license.


                                     RAY

                         Since when has that stopped you?


               INT. VAN - DUSK


               Robbie is driving into a city. Ray is sleeping in the passenger 
               seat. The streets are crowded with people walking. Robbie gets 
               worried and gets Ray to drive. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Ray. (no response) Ray. (no response) 
                         Dad!

 
               Ray wakes up and Robbie tries to get him to take the wheel.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         You think you could.... You think you 
                         could...

 
                                     RAY

                         Don't stop... don't take your foot off... 
                         Okay. I got it... I got it....

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where's everybody going?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know Rach. 


                                     RACHEL

                         But we do right?


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, we do.


               They continue driving through the crowd as they become more and 
               more mad at Ray for not letting them on. They begin banging on 
               the glass. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Why'd he do that?


               The man continues hitting the windshield.


                                     RACHEL

                         Why is he doing that?


                                     RAY

                         He wants a ride. Everybody just wants 
                         a ride.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Can we give him one?


                                     RAY

                         Just sit back and put on your seatbelt. 
                         Robbie, put on your seatbelt. 

 
               Rachel is busy looking at all the people who are now begging 
               for a ride.

 
                                     RAY

                         Put on your seatbelt Rachel.


               The three of them fasten their seatbelts.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Be careful.


               People bang on the windows louder as they shout "give me a ride".

 
               
                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away 
                         from the car.

 
               A police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window.


                                     RAY

                         HEY!!


                                     POLICE MAN 3

                         Stop the car!!


                                     RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

                         GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!

 
                         
                                     POLICE MAN 3

                         You could carry 20 people in there! 
                         STOP THE CAR!!!

 
               Rachel is panicking and starts to do the "arms" process to stay 
               calm. 

 
                                     RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

                         GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!

 
                         
               Ray hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side 
               of the van. Ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as 
               someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it. Rachel 
               screams in panic.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHH!!


                                     RAY

                         Oh hold on!!


               Robbie and Ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding 
               a baby. They swerve to miss her.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Look out! Look out!


                                     RAY

                         (seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD!

 
                         
               The van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches 
               about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins 
               to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side 
               to side shouting at about a riot level. 

 
               INT. VAN - DUSK


                                     RAY

                         Are you okay?


               Rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted 
               open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows 
               are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass. 
               A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the 
               hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the 
               van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to "push 
               it". He does so and the glass falls through.

 
               The passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by 
               the rioting crowd. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!!


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE?!?! ROBBIE?!?!?


               Ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him 
               out of the driver's side window.

 
                                     RAY

                         NO, JUST WAIT!!! WAIT!! STOP!!! JUST 
                         STOP!!!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!!


               A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and 
               tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back 
               into the crowd. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!!

 
                         
               Ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hit's the driver's 
               side door. Ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him 
               back into the crowd.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!


               Ray wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets 
               tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is 
               hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The 
               blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to 
               Ray. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (grasping his head in pain) AHHH!!!

 
                         
               Another man grabs Ray to try to fight him. Women in the crowd 
               yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling 
               Ray yells to "get in the car". Robbie fought off the men who 
               pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins 
               choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head 
               against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and 
               Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view. 

 
               
               A man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (through a choking grip) Rachel, get 
                         out of the car! GET OUT OF THE CAR RACHEL!!!

 
                         
               Ray just barely finishes as he is drug off into the crowd beyond 
               frame. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!


               Rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling 
               into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people 
               in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd.

 
               
               Ray manages to pull out his gun. He fires off two rounds into 
               the air. The crowd instantly moves away from him. One man yells 
               "take it easy!" No sign of Robbie. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (pointing the gun at the people on the 
                         roof of the car) GET OFF THE CAR!! GET 
                         OFF!!!

 
               Men start getting off the car to avoid the gun threatening Ray. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (continues) GET OFF THE CAR!! Move!! 
                         Move!!

 
               Realizing Robbie is nowhere in sight....


                                     RAY

                         Where's my son?!?!


                                     RIOT MAN 1

                         You don't need that, Man!


                                     RAY

                         WHERE'S MY SON?!?! ROBBIE!!    .... 
                           ROBBIE!!

 
                                     RIOT MAN 2

                         Put the gun down, man. It's not me!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (still determined to find Robbie) ROBBIE!!!

 
                         
               Ray is able to pull Robbie out from the crowd. Robbie has a running 
               bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. He is fighting to catch 
               his breath because he had it knocked out of him.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DAD!!!


               The camera moves from Robbie to Ray, then pivots on his face 
               to reveal a man holding another gun at Ray's head.

 
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         Okay, man, now listen. Put down the 
                         gun. I'm taking the car. 

 
                                     RAY

                         My daughter's in the car...


                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         (shaking the gun nervously) Put down 
                         the gun, I'm taking the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         All I want is my daughter....


                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         PUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!!


               Ray is scared into dropping his gun on the street. Ray then puts 
               his hands near his head to avoid being shot. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, all I want is my daughter. 

 
                         
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         (surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I just want my daughter. Please just 
                         let me take my daughter, can I.... All 
                         I want is my daughter. 

 
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take 
                         her, yeah, yeah....

 
               Ray grabs Rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the driver's 
               seat and closes the door. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie!!


               Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks 
               over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to 
               the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the 
               camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. 
               The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.

 
               
               INT. DINER - DUSK


               The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with 
               Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. 
               He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie 
               lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his 
               chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They 
               are all soaked from the rain. 

 
               They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and 
               off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots 
               are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his 
               hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain 
               as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around 
               to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One 
               more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite 
               his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. 
               The van drives away.

 
               Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what 
               to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has 
               none.

 
               Walking Down the Street - Dusk


               They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their 
               stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...." 
               while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some 
               people "don't give a shit who it is....."

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Looks like the power's still on here.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, power's still on because nothing 
                         bad has come up from under the ground.

 
                         
               A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and 
               lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just 
               like cars. They wait. 

 
               A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter 
               with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train, 
               as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars 
               go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue 
               walking.

 
               EXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK


               Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people 
               are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank 
               woman says over a megaphone... 

 
                                     WOMAN

                         Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative, 
                         thank you but we already have more blood 
                         than we can use. Again... (repeats message)

 
                         
               Shots of the herded people boarding the ferry.


               Solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving 
               folks".

 
                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         Please move forward calmly, the boat 
                         can make more than one trip. Please 
                         move forward calmly, take your time, 
                         don't rush. (repeats)

 
                                     SHERYL

                         Ray! RAY?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Sheryl?


                                     SHERYL

                         Yeah.


               Ray and Sheryl hug as they are re-united.


                                     SHERYL

                         Oh, my gosh, are these your kids?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Yes, this is Rachel.


                                     SHERYL

                         Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter, 
                         Nora. 

 
               Ray, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes.


                                     RAY

                         Hi, I've heard about you, Nora.


               Rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from 
               the boat. Robbie meets Sheryl with Ray.

 
                                     RAY

                         This is my son, Robbie.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Hi Sheryl.


                                     SHERYL

                         He's just like dad.


               Rachel continues watching the gulls.


                                     SHERYL

                         How you doing? You look like shit.

 
                         
               Rachel is now fully into watching the gulls. Ray, Sheryl, and 
               Robbie are engaged into small talk. Rachel sees the gulls flying 
               around something over the horizon behind the city.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (to herself) The trees are funny.

 
                         
                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         We're gonna move some cars out of the 
                         way to make more space. Give us a few 
                         minutes.

 
               Rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something 
               gets brighter on the horizon. Rachel grabs Ray's finger and he 
               realizes that she wants him. Ray turns around to see what Rachel 
               wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. Robbie sees Ray 
               looking that way, so he too looks that way. A robot puts it's 
               last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people. 
               It makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody. 
               The crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the 
               ship for safety. The captain sees the overflow and prepares the 
               ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow. 

 
                                     CAPTAIN

                         CAST OFF!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!


                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         CAST OFF NOW!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!! 
                         (to soldiers) No more people! No more 
                         people! We're taking the ramp up.

 
                         
               The soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for 
               quite a while. As the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start 
               to bulge forward from people pushing them. Three robots now switch 
               on their lights to look over the crowd of people. A moving crowd 
               of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so 
               far are withstanding. 

 
               Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to 
               let him and his family through. They say there is no more room.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to Sheryl) You just stay with me! Grab 
                         my jacket!

 
                                     SHERYL

                         I got you Ferrier. (trips) oh, Jesus!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         You okay? Come on!


                                     SHERYL

                         Jesus. Oh my god!


                                     RAY

                         Come on.


               The harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to 
               begin folding up the ramp. Soldiers shove empty cars off the 
               ramp. 

 
               Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's 
               jacket. 

 
                                     SHERYL

                         Oh, Ray!! RAY!!!


               They run faster and Sheryl falls farther behind. Robbie makes 
               a grab for her hand but a soldier stops Sheryl just short. 

 
               
                                     SHERYL

                         NO, I CAN GO WITH HIM!!!  RAY!!!! NO!!!!

 
                         
               The ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and 
               latch on to it. Ray looks back for Sheryl.

 
                                     RAY

                         SHERYL?!?!? SHERYL!!!!


                                     SHERYL

                         RAY!!!!


                                     RAY

                         There's room on the boat!!! 


                                     SHERYL

                         LET US THROUGH GOD DAMN IT!!!


                                     RAY

                         THERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S 
                         ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON 
                         THE BOAT!!!

 
               Rachel screams as Ray runs to the bow with Rachel in his arms. 
               Robbie is soon to follow...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Stay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!!

 
                         
               Robbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck.


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there 
               are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He 
               starts running to the stern of the ship.

 
               The captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers 
               start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the 
               dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins 
               pulling away.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (seeing Robbie running to the stern) 
                         Robbie? Robbie!?!?!

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded 
               up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are 
               hanging on the back side of the ramp. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Here, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got 
                         you! HOLD ON!!!

 
               Camera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people 
               in admiration and proud ness. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         TAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!! 


               INT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK


               The captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into 
               a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being 
               sucked in. 

 
                                     CAPTAIN

                         Oh, my god!


               Passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges 
               from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are 
               tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow 
               as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!!

 
                         
               The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one 
               side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running 
               towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. 
               Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for 
               them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly 
               pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding 
               on to Robbie's back, also going down.

 
               The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. 
               

 
               As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed 
               into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs 
               in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie 
               out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind 
               and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they 
               meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away 
               from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and 
               pulling them into the robot's holds. 

 
               EXT. BEACH - DARK


               Ray is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind. 
               They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for 
               so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Help me. Help me with her.


                                     ROBBIE

                         (gagging) Okay.


               Robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath. 

 
               
               Pulling each other up the hill....


                                     RAY

                         Don't stop. Don't stop.


               Alert sirens can be heard coming from the city.


               Ray pulls the two of them. 


                                     ROBBIE

                         (yells in pain) AHHH.


               They all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance 
               they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the 
               water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people 
               off the streets. Many people scream. 

 
               With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside 
               on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look 
               there with her. 

 
               THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people 
               with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel, 
               in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her, 
               and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat 
               down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill 
               to join the three. 

 
               Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as 
               we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing 
               falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods 
               where clothes fall like snow. 

 
               Pasture Fence Line - Dark


               Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line 
               of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 
               yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins 
               walking faster toward the gunfire.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, slow down.


               Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.


                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, slow down!!!


               Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling 
               down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into 
               a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up. 
               

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie.


                                     RAY

                         Robbie. We got to stay together Robbie.

 
                         
               Robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.


                                     RAY

                         Robbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!!


               Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their 
               heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET BACK HERE!!!


               Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have 
               now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can 
               to try to stay with Robbie.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!!

 
                         
               Robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel 
               are now searching for him.

 
                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!! (sets Rachel down next to 
                         a tree) NOW DON'T MOVE! FOR GOD'S SAKE, 
                         STAY RIGHT HERE! I'M COMING RIGHT BACK! 
                         (calling out for him) ROBBIE!!!

 
               Ray sees Robbie about 20' ahead of him. 


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!! ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back 
               by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie 
               fights to get back up.

 
                                     RAY

                         WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???


               Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over 
               the hill. Radio people are telling their officers "no effect 
               on target". 

 
               Robbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get 
               his attention on him.

 
                                     RAY

                         LISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU 
                         TO LISTEN TO ME!

 
               Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over 
               the hill. 

 
               Ray gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips 
               him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he 
               did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of 
               him, pining him down to the ground. 

 
                                     RAY

                         LISTEN TO ME! 


               Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over 
               the hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         DON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU!


                                     ROBBIE

                         I NEED TO BE HERE! I NEED TO SEE THIS!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUT 
                         YOU DON'T!!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         LET ME GO!!!


                                     RAY

                         YOU DON'T!!!


                                     ROBBIE

                         PLEASE LET ME GO!!!


               Rachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they 
               try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib). 

 
                                     RAY

                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN 
                         HATE ME.....

 
               Robbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the 
               ground.

 
                                     RAY

                         ... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         LET ME GO PLEASE!!!


                                     RAY

                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!!


                                     ROBBIE

                         DAD!!


               Ray sees the couple trying to get Rachel to go with them. For 
               a second, Ray doesn't know what to do. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Just listen to me!


                                     ROBBIE

                         I need to be here! I want to see this!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Wait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for 
                         your sister. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Please let me go! You need to let me 
                         go.

 
               Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. 
               Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. 
               Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough 
               trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. 
               

 
               Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at 
               each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. 
               Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER 
                         FATHER!!! 

 
                                     WOMAN

                         We thought she was alone... we....

 
                         
               She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill 
               where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls 
               over the hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie?!?!


               Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! 
               A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion 
               blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet. 

 
               
                                     RAY


                         ROBBIE!!!


               By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. 
               A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the 
               hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three 
               robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being 
               fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery. 
               

 
               EXT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - NIGHT


               Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away 
               from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle 
               as a signal for anybody who can see him.

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Over here! OVER HERE!!!


               Ray and Rachel run towards him. 


                                     HARLAND

                         Hurry!!


               The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run 
               into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar 
               doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people. 
               Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 


               Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks 
               at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the 
               clothes he wears. 

 
               Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and 
               Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (to Rachel) You all right?


               Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock. 


                                     HARLAND

                         (to Ray) And what about you?


               Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard 
               muttering "Robbie" very quietly.

 
               Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about 
               on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill 
               that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (while Harland moves the wheel barrel) 
                         (to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable? 
                         I need you to close your eyes now, okay? 
                         You need some sleep.

 
               Rachel's face is pure white with some red around her eyes.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


               Ray already knows what she is going to ask.


                                     RAY

                         He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna 
                         meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.

 
                         
               Harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall. 
               

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (about ready to cry) What do you think 
                         mom's doing right this minute?

 
               Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation. 
               He begins sharpening a shovel with a file. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I 
                         know she's not sleeping 'cause she is 
                         so worried about you. (trying to comfort 
                         her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen, 
                         and she's making that awful tea that 
                         she makes. And they're all just... ... 
                         ...there all just counting the minutes 
                         until they see you again.

 
               Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom. Ray sees 
               the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to 
               investigate what it is.

 
                                     RAY

                         (picking up the ribbon) What is this? 
                         What... What is this?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I won.


                                     RAY

                         You won?


                                     RACHEL

                         The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.

 
                         
               She begins to feel dreary...


                                     RACHEL

                         Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?


                                     RAY

                         (shakes his head in displeasure because 
                         he can't think of it) I don't remember 
                         that one.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?


                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one 
                         either. 

 
               Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that 
               it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a 
               moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby. 
                         So don't put me down. Because I've got 
                         the fastest set of wheels in the town. 
                         Something comes up to me that don't 
                         even try....

 
               Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing...


                                     RAY

                         (continues singing) ... If I had a set 
                         of wings, man, I know she could fly. 
                         She's my little deuce coupe. You don't 
                         know what I've got... just my little 
                         deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't 
                         know what I've got....

 
               Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland 
               taps two glasses together and says...

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Peach schnapps. 


               Ray gets up and begins walking towards him.


                                     HARLAND

                         Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole 
                         case of this shit. 

 
               Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down. 


                                     RAY

                         Thank you. 


               Silence falls over for a period.


                                     HARLAND

                         I'm sorry about your son.


                                     RAY

                         We got separated... he's gonna meet 
                         us in umm... in Boston.

 
               Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask...


                                     RAY

                         Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did 
                         you loose anybody? 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         All of them. 


               Another pause.


                                     HARLAND

                         (introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         (introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.

 
                         
               They shake hands.


                                     HARLAND

                         I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks. 
                         You're welcome to stay, both of yous.

 
                         
               Ray gets up from the conversation.


                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep. 
                         

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause) 
                         Those machines, those tripods they got... 
                         They buried them... right under our 
                         feet. Since before there were even people 
                         here. They've been planning this for 
                         a million years. We're beat to shit.

 
                         
               Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may 
               hear what he may say next. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, my daughter.


                                     HARLAND

                         Think about it.    ...    They defeated 
                         the greatest power in the world in a 
                         couple days. Walked right over us.  
                          ....    And these are only the first, 
                         they'll keep coming. This is not a war 
                         any more than there's a war between 
                         men and maggots. This is an extermination.

 
                         
               Ray walks over to where Rachel is sleeping.


                                     HARLAND

                         (feeling he's not grasping the reality) 
                         Are you afraid?

 
                                     RAY

                         Of course I am.


                                     HARLAND

                         (going on) I been around death plenty. 
                         Drive an ambulance in the city. Well, 
                         drove and ambulance in the city. That's 
                         all over now, huh?    ....   You know 
                         the people who make it Ray? The ones 
                         that don't flatline before the hospital? 
                         It's the ones who keep their eyes open, 
                         keep looking at you, keep thinking. 
                           ....    There the ones who survive... 
                            ....   We can' t loose our heads 
                         Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll 
                         kill you.    ......     I'm dead set 
                         on livin'.

 
               He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke.


                                     HARLAND

                         Hah. Dead set on Living. 


               Harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first 
               started. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Thank you for taking us in.


               Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes...


                                     HARLAND

                         We're not going to be exterminated.

 
                         
               The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside. 
               Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of 
               the basement collapses from all the vibration. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come 
                         on, I wanna show you something!

 
               They both are waling towards a window. 


                                     HARLAND

                         We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta 
                         have a weakness. Come on, take a look. 
                         

 
               Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out 
               of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Somehow they killed a few of these things 
                         in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling 
                         me the Japanese can figure it out but 
                         we can't? 

 
               Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere 
               else. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We can do it. We can get 'em. We can 
                         figure it out. 

 
               Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair. 


                                     RAY

                         Stay right there!


               Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground 
               almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands 
               that robots do this on a regular basis.

 
                                     RAY

                         I have a daughter! Why did you bring 
                         us here?

 
                                     HARLAND

                         To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....  
                          Now we'll be the ones coming up from 
                         underground. When the time is right, 
                         we'll take 'em by supries, the way they 
                         took us. We'll take 'em by surprise. 
                         

 
               Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying 
               with an insane man. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We're right under their feet, Ray. Right 
                         here, under their feet. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK


               Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. 
               He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines 
               it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming 
               in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall 
               and studies that one. 

 
               Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over 
               the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board 
               hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.

 
               
                                     HARLAND

                         You miss your mommy? I had a little 
                         girl nearly your age. You know, if anything 
                         happens to your daddy, I'll take care 
                         of you. 

 
               Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to 
               his daughter.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel!


               Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They 
               both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (distinctly angry, but not yelling) 
                         You don't have anything to say to her, 
                         do you understand? If you want to talk 
                         to somebody, or ask somebody a question, 
                         you ask me!

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (also angry at Ray) What exactly is 
                         your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna 
                         do. How about you? You gonna sit here, 
                         wait for them to come get you? Is that 
                         your plan?

 
               Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing 
               miscellaneous things. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Maybe you want to get caught. Couple 
                         of days hiding in a basement too much 
                         for you, I bet. You'll probably turn 
                         yourself right in! 

 
               The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops. 


                                     RAY

                         Listen. It stopped.


                                     HARLAND

                         (paying no attention) Maybe you'll be 
                         okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll 
                         train you as their pet. You know, train 
                         you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!

 
                         
               Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating 
               down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye 
               opens and lights turn on for it. 

 
               Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. 
               Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It 
               sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and 
               Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with 
               her. 

 
               The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs 
               an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head 
               no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince 
               him not to. 

 
               Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost 
               makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers 
               which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward 
               the noise. They run to a different spot.

 
               Robot gets closer...


               Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot 
               into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and 
               sees nothing. 

 
               It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. 
               The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind 
               the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and 
               Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief 
               comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.

 
               Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the 
               lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. 
               They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout 
               the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts 
               of the basement.

 
               Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens 
               but the gun is pulled back by Ray.

 
                                     RAY

                         (dead silent) Give me that!


               Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both 
               have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. 

 
               
               Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. 
               Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces 
               him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.

 
               
               The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. 
               

 
               Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just 
               as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens 
               scurry out through the open hole.

 
               Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....

 
               
                                     HARLAND

                         You and I... I don't  think we are on 
                         the same page. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY


               The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along 
               the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red 
               mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the 
               mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts 
               his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood. 
               

 
                                     HARLAND

                         RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! 


                                     RAY

                         KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!! 

 
                         
               Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of 
               blood. 

 
               They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man 
               being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes 
               down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray 
               has a horrified look on his face. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My 
                         Blood!!!

 
               Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling. 
               Then... the robots stop because they hear him. Ray runs to Harland 
               who is digging some sort of hole. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it! 
                         You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!

 
                         
                                     HARLAND

                         (with an insane expression and tone) 
                         They drink us!

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, they'll hear you!


                                     HARLAND

                         Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         You gotta be quiet!


                                     HARLAND

                         Drink US and....


                                     RAY

                         They're gonna come back down here!

 
                         
               Harland has mentally lost it now. 


                                     HARLAND

                         Then they spit us out all over their 
                         goddamn red weeds!

 
                                     RAY

                         (no longer whispering) Do you understand 
                         what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let 
                         my daughter die because of you. 

 
                         
               Harland pays no attention to him.


                                     HARLAND

                         This tunnel will get us to the city. 
                         We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready 
                         Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Stop it!


                                     HARLAND

                         You can hide a whole army down there!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Stop it!!


                                     HARLAND

                         ... We'll go underground!


                                     RAY

                         STOP IT!!!


                                     HARLAND

                         Sneak attacks at night!


                                     RAY

                         YOU STOP IT!!!


               Ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead 
               with a shovel. Ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile 
               next to Harland. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We're the resistance Ray! They can't 
                         occupy this country! Occupations always 
                         fail! History's taught us that a thousand 
                         times. This is our land.

 
               Ray runs up the stairs of the room to Rachel standing calmly 
               in the middle of the basement. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (continues) ... We eat it, we breathe 
                         it, only we can live on it! They can't 
                         survive here Ray. They weren't built 
                         for it.

 
               Ray hugs Rachel because he knows what he has to do. 


               Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared 
               for what he has to do.

 
               Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing 
               go erratic. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What are you doing?


                                     RAY

                         Whatever you hear... don't take this 
                         off.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad??


                                     RAY

                         Rach?


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


                                     RAY

                         What was that song... that lullaby I 
                         didn't know?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Hushabye Mountains


                                     RAY

                         Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it. 


                                     RACHEL

                         (begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Don't stop.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... On Hushabye Mountain...


                                     RAY

                         That's my girl.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... For far away my baby goes...


               Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then 
               walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting "not 
               my blood"

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ... it fills the sails ... 


               Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... of boats that are waiting ...

 
                         
               Ray closes the door behind him as he steps in. 


                                     RACHEL

                         ... Waiting to sail your worries away 
                         ...

 
               Rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the 
               door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye 
                         Mountain ... 

 
               Rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         ... Wave goodbye to the cares of the 
                         day and watch your boat, from Hushabye 
                         Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby 
                         Bay. 

 
               All is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out. 
               Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is 
               sitting on the stairs. 

 
               Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both 
               sit there in silence. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK


               Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch. As we view down from 
               Ray's face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some reason. 
               She sits up and....

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHH!!!


               A robot camera is 1' away from her face. Rachel runs to the wall, 
               still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. The camera 
               hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris. 

 
               Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment 
               line. Rachel screams as he hit's the line. Over and over and 
               over. Rachel runs up the basement stairs. Ray continues hitting 
               it and it finally pulls away. The camera, still attached by a 
               hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Rachel???


               No response for a few seconds, then Rachel lets off a gut wrenching 
               scream. 

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god, 
                         no!

 
               He runs up the stairs to search for her in the house. 


                                     RAY

                         Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs) 
                         Rachel??

 
               Ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in 
               the doorway. He quickly brushes them down stepping out the door. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (searching) Rachel, make some noise 
                         baby. Rachel??

 
               He begins walking down a path to look for her farther out.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come 
                         on!

 
               He gets no response from Rachel. All is dead silent accept for 
               him. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!


               Ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the 
               hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!!! RACHEL!!!


               A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough 
               to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes 
               after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass, 
               grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (screams) AHH!


               Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He 
               looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill. 

 
               The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw. 
               Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it. 

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!!


                                     RAY

                         NO NO NO!!!


               The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the 
               foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades. 
               He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         HEY!!!


               It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. 
               It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (screams in pain) AHHH!


               He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as 
               well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera 
               shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion. 
               Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!


               He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound 
               and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls 
               down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the 
               ship. The same happens in the other cage. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response) 
                         Rachel.

 
               She seems to be frozen. 


                                     RAY

                         Rachel.


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


               Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all 
               the people around and the door opens to take another person up. 
               Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing 
               claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go 
               with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's 
               hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this 
               and latches onto Ray's arm. 

 
                                     SOLDIER 2

                         Pull me! Pull me!!!


               People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving 
               him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join. 

 
               
                                     SOLDIER 2

                         We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!

 
                         
               Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the 
               cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is 
               seen by the soldier. 

 
                                     SOLDIER 2

                         EVERYBODY DOWN!!!


               Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. 
               We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors 
               and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages 
               and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb 
               out. 

 
               Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a 
               way that meant how did you do that.

 
               Boston City Limits - Freeway - Day


               Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering 
               them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant 
               which appears to be dying rapidly.  Ray picks up a piece, of 
               dead plant.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What happened to it?


               Ray crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows 
               away.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's dying. 


               Watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half 
               struck into a building. 

 
                                     RAY

                         What happened?


                                     SOLDIER 3

                         I don't know, something's happening 
                         to them. Please keep moving.

 
               Ray goes up to another soldier for information.


                                     RAY

                         Something's happening to them?


                                     SOLDIER 4

                         Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir. 


               Ray asks another soldier down the road for information.


                                     RAY

                         Excuse me, excuse me, what happened 
                         here? You guys take it down? 

 
                                     SOLDIER 5

                         No sir, it was behaving erratically, 
                         walking in circles then it went down 
                         on it's own about an hour ago. (to people) 
                          Now let's keep moving, don't stop do 
                         not stop! Keep moving!

 
               Rachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other 
               people.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         How is it dead all by it's self?


                                     RAY

                         Rachel, I'm not sure. 


               Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water 
               tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense 
               if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be 
               heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel".

 
               
               Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot. 
               The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the 
               robot makes the viberating sound. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (to a soldier, during the robot noise) 
                         LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!


                                     RAY

                         LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!


                                     RAY

                         (louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!

 
                         
               The soldier looks at them and doesn't get what Ray's getting 
               at. He looks back at Ray. The noise continues erratically as 
               if the robot is fighting to stay alive.

 
                                     RAY

                         NO SHIELDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         (motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (pointing) NO SHIELDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         (now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE 
                         JAVELIN'S THE KEY! LOAD THE GUSTAV, 
                         IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH KILL!!! LET'S 
                         GO!!!

 
               Ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to the people in the tunnel and Rachel) 
                         It's safer in here!

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         LETS GO!!! BRIGN OUT THE JAVELIN!!!

 
                         
               Soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles 
               at the robot. The first missile hit's the grabbing claws and 
               knocks them off. A few more shots and the robot collapses into 
               a nearby factory. The factory explodes and the robot grinds to 
               a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls 
               out of the door. It quickly dies on site. 

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         IT'S CLEAR!


               We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.


               Boston - Walking Down Street near Mary Ann's Mother's house - 
               Day

 
               Mary Ann walks up to the front door and sees Ray walking down 
               the street with Rachel in his arms. She flutters open the doors 
               and she and Rachel run towards each other on the street. Mary 
               Ann begins crying.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         MOM!!!


               They hug each other crying. 


               Mary Ann looks at Ray who is still standing in the middle of 
               the street. 

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (just barely hearable) Thank you.

 
                         
               Mary Ann's parents come out of the door. The mother has a shocked 
               look on her face. Tim is behind them. 

 
               Ray's eyes and face perk up as we see ROBBIE coming down the 
               front steps towards him. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie?


               Ray and Robbie take a good look at each other and Robbie finally 
               mutters with a dry throat.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Hey dad!


               They hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival.

                         From the moment the invaders arrived, 
                         breathed our air, ate and drank, they 
                         were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, 
                         after all of man's weapons and devices 
                         had failed, by the tiniest creatures 
                         that God and his wisdom, put upon this 
                         earth. At the toll of a billion deaths, 
                         man had earned his immunity, is right 
                         to survive among this planet's infinite 
                         organisms. And that right is ours against 
                         all challenges, for men do not live 
                         nor die in vein.

          1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1

          A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly
          floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath.
          Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern
          India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and
          beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall
          clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing
          beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives
          way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we
          are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and
          onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of
          utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny
          shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald
          rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing
          lights. The camera slows, and hovers.

          2 EXT. SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 2

          Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed
          wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight.
          Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber
          buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and
          all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided
           barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall. 

           SUPER: 'SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA, 1940'.

          3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3

           A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two
           tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal
           stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A
          dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 
          to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear
          scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in
          prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian
          territories, still ear something of their national 
          costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners
          from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages
          drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of
          types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving
          and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each
          other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men
          are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or
          'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that
          has put them here.
          Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a
          group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.
          These men look healthier, and are further distinguished
          by their tattoos.

                         (CONTINUED)

          These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular
          criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters
          of the block.
          Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily
          tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent,
          BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this
          criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made
          cards.
          [All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED,

          EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH].

                         BOHDAN

                         (IN RUSSIAN)
          What've you got?
          VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines
          it briefly.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          Think I want your stinking lice
          farm?

                         VALKA
          Polish tailor.
          He shows the label.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          See? From Krakov. Good as new.
          BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden
          suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts
          his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of
          sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the
          coat.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          And the sausage.
          BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I
          swear. I hope you die with an axe
          in your skull, and your balls
          ripped out.
          The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no
          reaction.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          OK. For the bread.

                         (CNNTTNTTFD )

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3
          BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with
          the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid 
          plays, VALKA is left coat-less. 
          Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,
          the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just
          entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,
          SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other
          ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes
          three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes
          them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.

                         BOHDAN
          For the bread.

                         VALKA 
          For the bread, and the sausage, 
          bastard! 
          BOHDAN enjoying himself. 

                         BOHDAN 
          Throw in that crappy shirt you're 
          wearing and I might be tempted. 
          Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but
          he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage.
          Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a
          tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking
          across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again
          VALKA loses.
           VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his 
           bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then 
          offers to BOHDAN. 

                          BOHDAN (CONT'D)
           I don't play for regulation issue
           crap.
          VALKA lights a cigarette. 

                          BOHDAN (CONT'D) 
           All done, Valka? 
           VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil 
          of cool. 

                          VALKA 
           I go on credit. 

                          BOHDAN 
           'Credit'? 

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4.

                         3

                         3 CONTINUED: ( 3)
          VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by
          a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          You're already in debt.
          VALKA's anxious eyes. They settle on SMITH by the stove.
          He speaks in carefully articulated English.

                         VALKA
          Come here.
          SMITH returns the stare, then slowly approaches.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Take off your coat.
          A silence, the criminal gang sensing a showdown. There's
          something about SMITH, something steely, unpredictable.
          The fire crackles loudly. SMITH all the while holding
          VALKA's stare.

          [THE DIALOGUE RETURNS TO RUSSIAN.]

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Worth shit!
          He looks at SMITH's companion.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You.
          ANDREI goes pale, removes his coat to reveal a decent-
          looking patterned wool sweater. He offers the coat.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Let's have the sweater.

                         ANDREI
          Take the coat.

                         VALKA
          I want the sweater.
          ANDREI doesn't move.

           VALKA (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
          Your babushka make it for you?
          Come on, hand it over.

                          
          ANDREI is visibly shaking.

                         ANDREI
          You have no authority, here.
          VALKA gets up, moves slowly to ANDREI, a smile on his
          lips. Then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his
          trousers deeper into his boots, reaches for something,
          and in one slow balletic movement, swings up and
          stretches out his hand to ANDREI, and ANDREI sobs and
          leans to one side.

                         BOHDAN
          Was that really necessary?
          In the dim light ANDREI's face is grey as he sags to the
          floor. None of the other prisoners move to help him, nor
          do they show any sign of concern, as VALKA places the
          knife back in his boot and returns to the game. YURI
          steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man,
          handing it on to VALKA, who passes it to BOHDAN. BOHDAN
          examines it professionally, wipes a little blood off his
          hands.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          OK. For the sausage.
          The game resumes.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          4 EXT. GRAVEYARD, FOREST NEAR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 4

          Freshly dug graves. Close on one of these, stones piled
          in a mound over the grave. Hands into frame moving aside
          the stones. Wider to see two PRISONERS, breath steaming
          from their mouths, as they work quickly and quietly to
          uncover the grave. The older of the two is KHABAROV,
          late thirties, the other, LAZAR, late twenties. Furtive
          looks over their shoulders as an occasional blade of
          light from the watchtower throws them into silhouette.

                         KHABAROV
          Here he is.
          He reaches out to touch a human toe poking out of the
          rocks.
          As they work -
          Close on the face of ANDREI, as they continue to uncover
          his body.

          He's not frozen yet, that's lucky.
          The remaining stones are removed to find the corpse
          dressed in nothing but underwear.

                         LAZAR
          Damn! Picked clean! Bloody
          thieves.

                         KHABAROV
          Keep your voice down, be grateful
          there's anything left.
          They reach into the grave to retrieve the underwear.

           A Soviet guard beats a hammer against a hanging length of
          iron.

          6 INT. BARRACK BUILDING - SAME TIME - DAWN 6

          Close on the barrack stove, the underwear drying,
          KHABAROV's hands into the frame.
          As the prisoners rise, follow a hand to hand exchange of
          the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV
          having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR.
          Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps
          half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for
          two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the
          men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one
          piece of bread, concealing the rest in a hiding place in
          the dirt at the base of his bunk - a glimpse of a cache
          of hoarded food and other items.

          The saved morsel he places on his tongue, and closes his
          eyes. He doesn't chew, just lets it dissolve like the
          Eucharist. Then it's gone in a slow swallow and he opens
          his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he
          hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at
          his hand. Close on a spot between his fingers - there's
          a crumb there. Into frame, the tip of his tongue as it
          slowly and carefully retrieves the tiny speck of bread.

          7 EXT. LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - DAWN 7

          The camp seen in a distant view - surrounded by double
          wire, a collection of weathered timber buildings with
          watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the
          perimeter. In the distance, dense forest.
          Entering frame a column of close to a hundred men march
          toward the camp. Following behind is a lorry, carrying
          six guards, supplies for their recent journey, and a camp
          stove.

          8 EXT. CAMP GATES - DAWN 8

          As they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch
          stretching across the gates - a hand-painted sign in
          Russian subtitled: 'LABOR IS HONOR, GLORY, NOBILITY, AND

          HEROISM'.
          The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a
          look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. 
          ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast,
          marching toward them on their way to work. They have
          their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns
          pass each other the contrast between the half-starved,
          ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of
          the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we
          are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse
          some of those already established - they include BOHDAN,
          and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As
          they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both
          Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian
          with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a
          blanket over his three-piece suit. Beside him, another
          Pole - KAZIK, at seventeen, the youngest in the group.

          9 EXT. 'THE ZONE', CAMP 105 - DAY 9

          The newly arrived prisoners assemble between the various
          buildings - an area known as the 'ZONE'.

          The camp is being expanded, and everywhere are piles of
          cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing
          old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones.
          The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into
          slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the
          Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks
          with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new
          camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and
          the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently
          issues an order dismissing him.
          The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of
          documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received
          them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys
          the prisoners before him. He's a man in his fifties with
          a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features.
          He looks up from the collection of documents in his hand.

                         COMMANDANT
          Enemies of the People! Look about
          you...and understand... it is not
          our guns, or our dogs, or our
          wire, that forms your prison.
          Siberia is your prison. All four
          million square miles of it. Here
          in Camp 105, you will work hard.

          Later, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house,
          heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of
          others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash-
          house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort
          through their belongings, pocketing the odd item.
          JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut.
          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on
          replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed-
          wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a
          section of the old wall falls to the ground.

          14 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, THE ZONE - NIGHT 14

          The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the
          side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful
          eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of
          thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no
          bowl, so he uses his hat.
          JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window.
          Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners
          feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a
          hand on the shoulder of the man in front.

          SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on
          hearing English spoken.
          As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men
          scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into
          the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd
          scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime,
          then lick them clean.

          SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a
          hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips
          it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of
          the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage-
          eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him,
          placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches
          as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats
          it, his every move watched by the starving man at his
          feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man
          who greedily drinks it. SMITH and JANUSZ stare at each
          other.

          I'm an old man. But I'll be alive
          in the morning. He won't.
          He goes to move away, hesitates, turns back to JANUSZ.

          'Kindness'. That can kill you
          here. You'll learn that.
          He places the last morsel of bread in his mouth, and
          chewing slowly, turns and walks away.

          'aristocratic' even. He offers his hand, and they shake.

          KHABAROV looks into JANUSZ's eyes - a pain beyond
          speaking. KHABAROV tactfully changes the subject.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          I was an actor - moving pictures.
          In my last picture I played an
          aristocrat. They arrested me
          after the film's release.

                         JANUSZ
          Why?

                         KHABAROV
          It was claimed I was elevating the
          status of the old nobility.

                         JANUSZ
          You got ten years for a
          performance in a film?

                         KHABAROV
          I've had better notices.
          And they enter their hut.

          15 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 15

          The men sitting or lying on their bunks, a little
          conversation here and there but most have withdrawn into
          themselves, just glad to have survived another day.
          JANUSZ looks about him, KHABAROV still by his side.
          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the tattooed group
          playing cards by the stove. VALKA is playing BOHDAN
          again, his losing streak continuing. KHABAROV speaks
          just above a whisper.

                         KHABAROV

          Professional criminals, your
          ordinary run of the mill murderers
          and thieves, don't stare at them.
          The guards let them run things in
          here. They are to be feared.

          They are considered the by-product
          of bourgeoisie society and
          therefore 'Friends of the People'.
          We political prisoners are
          'Enemies of the People'. Russia
          has become one vast prison - slave
          labor. You see even this camp is
          expanding to take in another
          thousand prisoners.
          JANUSZ looks over to a group of Asiatic prisoners.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          From the far reaches of the Soviet
          Empire - all scooped up in the net
          like so many minnows, poor
          creatures.

                         JANUSZ
          And do any ever wriggle out of the
          net?
          KHABAROV considers a moment, then leads him away from the
          surrounding prisoners. He lowers his voice to a whisper.

                         KHABAROV
          You should be more careful.
          Stalin has eyes and ears
          everywhere, even in here.
          He leans closer to JANUSZ.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          In a camp like this you'll be dead
          in a year. If not literally then
          in spirit.

          A18 EXT. THE ZONE, CAMP 105 - DAWN A18

          In bone-chilling cold the prisoners form up in their
          brigades as a guard begins counting them. JANUSZ looks
          toward a barrack building where the bodies of several men
          who died overnight are being carried out and laid on the
          ground - among them the 'garbage-eater' from the night
           before. JANUSZ glances over toward SMITH who stares
          impassively ahead. GUARD NO. 1 is visible, checking
          paper work at the camp gates.

          AB18 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST, ABOVE MINE - DAY AB18

          Follow a bird as it hops from branch to branch, pausing
          every now and then to listen to the sounds of axes and
          saws drifting from the forest floor.
          JANUSZ and his friends - VOSS, TOMASZ, KAZIK and ZORAN -
          work at trimming felled trees of branches, and then
          sawing them into lengths.
          SMITH and his gang work nearby. He watches JANUSZ
          peeling strips of bark from a pine-tree and stuffing them
          in his pocket.
          KHABAROV, too, works here with a third gang, cutting and
          trimming the trees.

          AC18 MINE SITE - DAY AC 18
           On the valley floor, below towering cliffs, some 150 men
          haul rocks in wooden wheelbarrows from the mine entrance
          across a maze of tracks to waiting trucks.
          A fire blazes in a 44 gallon drum set up in an open-sided
          wooden shelter. Here BOHDAN and his criminal associates
          supervise the work. VALKA has fallen on a slippery slope
          within the Urka hierarchy following his losses and
          growing debt.

          BOHDAN amuses himself by throwing stones at VALKA,
          warning him away from the fire like a stray dog. 
          Guards placed at vantage points, stamp their feet to keep
          warm, occasionally shouting at the exhausted prisoners to
          work harder or move faster. Death is casual here. A man
          falls. If found to be dead he is left where he fell,
          bodies to be collected and counted at the end of the day.

          AD18 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY AD18 

          JANUSZ and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay
          by the mine entrance. He hesitates as the others move
          away, staring into the black hole leading into the
          mountain. Eerie sounds drift up from deep below. A look
          of utter dread on his face.

          18 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST, ABOVE MINE - DUSK 18 

          The prisoners work hard to fill their quotas - VOSS
          swings his axe like a demon, but even with his
          contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from the
          mark showing at the top of the storage bay.
          BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working
          gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's
          group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV
          leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ.

                         KHABAROV

                         (IN ENGLISH)
          Quickly now, half-quota means half-
          rations. Quota is Law here.

                         JANUSZ 
          No-one could meet that quota even 
          if they were fed and rested. 
          KHABAROV calls for them to follow him. He leads them at 
          a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes
          buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears
          away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut
          timber.

                         KHABAROV
          Cut last year and never collected!
          Quickly hide them inside your
          fresh cut timber!
          BOHDAN moving closer. It becomes a race to transport all
          the old logs to their pile and to conceal them inside the
          fresh cut logs.

          They just make it, but BOHDAN notices the end of an old
          grey log poking out from the center of the stack. He
          stops his measuring of their quota. A tense moment, then
          he nods and leaves. KHABAROV crosses from his gang to
          join them.

                         JANUSZ

          KHABAROV shrugs.

          He knows, but he doesn't care, as
          long as his arse is protected.

          The long march back to camp. JANUSZ peers left and right
          toward the beckoning forest. Beside him ZORAN senses his
          friend might just take off then and there. He places a
          restraining hand on his arm, as a guard's voice drifts
          through the still air:

          VOSS and KAZIK are by the stove unwinding their long foot-
          cloths that most wear in place of socks. KAZIK hangs the
          damp cloths on the stove to dry and sets out to examine
          his toes, which are in poor shape, suffering the early
          stages of frostbite. TOMASZ sits nearby sketching the

          charcoal.

          BOHDAN lies on his bunk, surrounded by several of his
          tattooed henchmen listening to a story. The storyteller,
          looking rather uncomfortable, is ZORAN. His Russian is
          good but for a moment his memory fails him as he
          desperately tries to recall the next beat in the story.

                         BOHDAN
          Keep going and you'll get some

          VALKA appears a sketch in his hand. He passes it to
          BOHDAN. CLOSE on the sketch - a lusty naked woman.
          VALKA makes a gesture implying masturbation. BOHDAN
          examines the drawing before licking the back of it,
          lifting his shirt, sticking it to his chest, then
          lowering his shirt again. He waves VALKA away.

          KHABAROV leads him toward the wire. From somewhere deep

          indicates the location of the camp.

          We believe about 500 kilometers
          north of Lake Baikal.

                         JANUSZ
          We could follow the edge of the

          JANUSZ's eyes burn with excitement. KHABAROV takes his
          arm, as if drawing energy from the younger man.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          Spring is already upon us. It
          would have to be next autumn.

                         JANUSZ
          Why wait?

                         KHABAROV
          It's 1000 kilometers to the
          border, maybe more. We need
          careful planning, stock-pile food.
          I've already begun - trading,
          dealing. You could do the same.
          In the Autumn the weather is
          predictable. We need the early
          snows to cover our tracks.
          JANUSZ nods.

                         JANUSZ
          What about my friends?

                         KHABAROV
          If you trust them. But they won't
          all survive.

                         JANUSZ
          But they'd die free men.
          KHABAROV offers his hand, and they shake.

           KHABAROV and JANUSZ enter, having buried the shirt in the 
           snow. KHABAROV indicates LAZAR, sitting on a bunk , and 
           whispers. 

                          KHABAROV 
           That's Lazar. He was architect.

          WIDER, as they shake their clothing free of the lice, and
          hurry over to join the assembly of prisoners at the
          kitchen servery window for their meagre breakfast ration.
          At the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the
          bodies of those who have died overnight is underway. The
          corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial.
          JANUSZ pauses, a muttered prayer on his lips. Then he's
          passing the hospital barracks - the usual crowd of
          desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted, to be
          excused another day of the killing work, the majority
          turned away. He joins the line at the kitchen. The
          days' bread ration is being weighed and issued. If not
          exactly 500 grams a little is added or subtracted, the
          cook keeping trimmed slices, placing them in a tin.

          28 EXT. THE ZONE/CAMP EXTERIOR - DAWN 28

          Having been counted once, inside the camp, the brigade of
          prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed
          guards who will escort them to work are waiting. GUARD
          NO. 1 begins counting them again. It's much colder than
          usual, prisoners beating their arms to keep warm, a high
          wind blowing. Khabarov stands with JANUSZ. 

                         KHABAROV
          Temperature is dropping. Below 60
          they're not supposed to send us
          out. Know how to tell the
          temperature? You see frosty fog -

           easily but in a rasping fashion?

          A30 EXT. ROAD THROUGH FOREST - DAY A30

          The freezing wind has picked up considerably, driving
          sleet against the column of prisoners, forcing them to a
          halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the
          guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'?
          The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse,
          their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them.
          JANUSZ and his friends find themselves near SMITH and
          watch as he hails a GUARD.

                         SMITH

          We need to make shelter.

           Yes, but lose 200 men and you'll
           have some forms to fill out.
           Could go badly for you.
          The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to
          stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The
          GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other
          guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on
          the freezing ground. All but SMITH.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We could move into the forest,
          find shelter!

          GUARD NO. 1
          Lie down!
          The GUARD is about to leave when to his astonishment, and
          that of the other prisoners, SMITH begins to walk toward
          the forest edging the road. The GUARD draws his pistol.
          On the ground ZORAN lies beside JANUSZ, as they watch the
          unfolding drama.
          GUARD NO. 1 shouts for SMITH to return, others raise
          their rifles, waiting for his order to fire. He is
          conflicted, and after a tense moment gestures for them to
          lower their weapons.

          GUARD NO. 1 (CONT'D)
          Let the prisoners take shelter in
          the trees! Shoot anyone who makes
          a run for it!
          JANUSZ stares after SMITH, admiring of his reckless
          courage.

          AB30 FOREST, LATER - DAY AB30
          The men work frantically collecting fallen timber. SMITH
          watches as VOSS picks up a massive log, places it on his
          shoulder and carries it to where JANUSZ is supervising
          the building of their shelter. Most of the other
          prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of
          sticks to make windbreaks, but JANUSZ is building
          something more elaborate. SMITH's eyes miss nothing as
          he notes JANUSZ's skill and the way the others work as a
          team under his direction.

           JANUSZ calls KHABAROV to join them, but he declines
           politely. He moves on to find SMITH - invites him back
           to their improvised shelter. As SMITH sits, ZORAN offers
           his hand.

          That's right.
          As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into
          his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He
          hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews
          on the bark. The others follow his example.
          Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He
          takes note of the group as future troublemakers.

           The men are stirring, struggling up to face another day, 
           when the door opens, and in a flurry of snow, GUARD NO. 1 
           enters with another soldier. He orders SMITH, JANUSZ and 
           his group to fall out. As he passes SMITH - 

           GUARD NO. 1

           And as he moves away SMITH mutters to JANUSZ.

           Might as well have shot us 
           yesterday.

           We're for the mine. 

          30 INT. MINE - DAY 30

          A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the
          frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures
          working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled
          sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet
          deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more
          sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the
          most time in this frozen hell.
          The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ
          shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses
          to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves
          into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks,
          the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the
          cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand
          was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately,
          fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia.
          Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead.

          31 INT. DEEPER IN THE MINE - DAY 31

          KAZIK and a man known as 'THE PROF', drag a cart laden
          with rock up a steep incline. They wear horse collars
          attached to the cart by leather harnesses.

          something to KAZIK in Russian. He shakes his head. He
          doesn't speak Russian. THE PROF tries German, then
          English.

          even more effort into dragging the load.

          32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32

          A man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long
          pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it
          easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the
          'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe-
          stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along
          pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to
          warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when
          the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their
          hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth.
          SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot
          here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to
          see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant
          mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted
          against the light. He watches a moment, something not
          right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries
          after him.

          JANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls
          to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the
          ground.

          JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY 
           Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.
          He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.
          Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a
          hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.
          His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the
          path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,
          then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A
          pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the
          wall.

          34 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 34

          CLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him,
          grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an
          adjoining tunnel.

                         SMITH
          Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

                         JANUSZ
          Got to get out!
          SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake
          with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back
          to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands
          around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH
          bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to
          JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its
          effect.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          It can be done.

                         SMITH
          What can be done? 

                         JANUSZ
          He knows a way through the wire.
          SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point-
          Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.

          His name is Khabarov.
          Now SMITH understands.

                         SMITH
          The actor.

                         JANUSZ
          You know him?

                         SMITH
          He has no intention of escaping.

                         JANUSZ
          What?

                         SMITH
          He's aliar. Been here foryears
          -seeksout new arrivals, mewhen
          Ifirstcame here. He justlikes
          totalkabout escape. I'veknown
          others like him.

                         JANUSZ
          Why should I believe you?

                         SMITH
          (shakes his head)
          Nothing is for nothing in the
          camps. From you he gets your
          energy, your spirit. You feed his
          'dream' of escape. You help keep
          him alive. He's no more than a
          leech.

                         JANUSZ
          You're a cold bastard, Mister.

                         SMITH

                         (SHRUGS)
          I'm still alive, that's all I
          know. But I won't be in six
          months. And neither will you.
          Not in the mines. So, if you're
          serious about making a run for it -
          I'm in.

                         JANUSZ
          I thought you were a loner?

                         SMITH
          Can't be done alone. Besides you
          have a weakness that could be
          useful to me.

                         JANUSZ
          And what's that?

                         SMITH
          Compassion. If anything happens
          to me, I'm counting on you
          carrying me.
          JANUSZ knows he's not joking.

          35 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, SAME TIME - NIGHT 35

           It is snowing heavily, and after swallowing their soup, 
           JANUSZ and his friends walk back to the barracks. KAZIK 
           stumbles, and is helped to his feet by VOSS. He limps on 
           to the barrack a hand resting for support on VOSS' 
           shoulder. JANUSZ is preoccupied and he hesitates at t he 
           door, turns, and looks back. After a moment staring at 
           the ground he hurries inside. 

          36 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 36

          JANUSZ has a puzzled KHABAROV by the arm, guiding him
          back to the door.

          37 EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 37

          He points to the ground - CLOSE on footprints as they
          rapidly disappear under the heavy snowfall.

                         JANUSZ
          Tonight.
          KHABAROV looks from the footprints to JANUSZ, a horrified
          look on his face.

                         KHABAROV
          It's a passing storm!

                         JANUSZ
          It'll do, it'll cover our tracks.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Impossible! We need preparation,
          detailed plans, maps

                         JANUSZ

                         (OVERLAP)
          The timing will never be perfect, 
          they won't expect it now!

                         KHABAROV
          But the distances! And food!
          What about food?

                         JANUSZ
          We've been trading, the American
          is with us. He has food, you have
          food.

                         KHABAROV
          How long will that last?

                         JANUSZ
          I've spent half my life in the
          woods and mountains. We'll live
          off the land.

                         KHABAROV
          It can't be done!
          JANUSZ shocked at the change in his friends' demeanor,
          the appalling realization that SMITH was right about him.
          He seizes his arm.

                         JANUSZ
          How do we get through the wire?

                         KHABAROV
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                         JANUSZ
          Your friend, Lazar, he knows
          doesn't he?
          A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face. Someone behind
          JANUSZ. JANUSZ turns. VALKA, a few paces away watching
          them. KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks.
          JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows.

          A38 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT A38

           In the last minutes before lights out the would-be
           escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other 
           items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and 
           BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and
           most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades
           more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries 
           to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in 
           poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK 
           does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is 
          doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS
          whispers to him.

                         VOSS
          You can't see, can you?
          A look of panic crosses the boy's face.

                         KAZIK

                         (WHISPERS)
          Don't leave me behind!
          VOSS conflicted.

                         KAZIK (CONT'D)
          Promise me, Andrejs! I could keep
          a hand on your shoulder by night,
          and in the day I can see just
          fine. I won't hold you up.
          Please don't tell them. I'll die
          here.
          JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on
          LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire.
          He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from
          his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the
          deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging
          the barracks into darkness.

          AB38 EXT. THE CAMP - NIGHT AB38

          Several shots of the wind driven snow whipping about the
          buildings.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            32.

          38 INT. BARRACKS - LATER THAT NIGHT 38

          The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea
          as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The
          sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,
          hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.
          CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,
          KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,
          catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.
          KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected
          sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at
          the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be
          attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving
          about near him, a look of terror on his face.

          LATER,
          JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A
          movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his
          throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his
          cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.

                         VALKA
          There are no secrets here.

                         JANUSZ
          What do you want?

                         VALKA
          The game goes against me. Small
          debt - lose fingers. Big debt, 
          they take head. Me, big debt.
          But one thing I never gamble is my
          Wolf.
          He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the
          blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In forest you need knife to 
          survive. Without? A miracle.
          He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You need a knife, and I need
          miracle to get me out of here.
          With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers
          and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          39 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAWN 39

          Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward
          the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight
          isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards.
          They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and
          baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs
          into the gap, then following them toward the distant
          forest.

          40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40

          Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and
          out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them,
          as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with
          JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt,
          occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his
          feet fast enough to keep up with the others.
          JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the 
          moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before 
          plunging on Southward. 

                         41 FURTHER ALONG 41 
          They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their
          breath. The snow continues to fall but JANUSZ will allow 
          no rest and moves off without a backward glance. 

                         42 FURTHER STILL 42
           JANUSZ is out in front when SMITH stops, resting his 
           hands on his knees, gulping for air. The others stop
           too, VALKA dropping to his knees. JANUSZ runs back to 
           VALKA, drags him to his feet. 

                          JANUSZ
           Get up. Or we die right now. You
           know how fast dogs travel. 
           He turns to the others. 

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D) 
           Run, damn you! Run! 
           He moves to SMITH. 

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Is it time for me to carry you?

          SMITH waves him away, gets up and continues.

          43 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - DAY 43

          A feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The
          snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep
          depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no
          further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight
          is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS.
          In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They
          look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the
          sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen
          timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle
          in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to
          VALKA, whispers.

                         JANUSZ
          Knife .
          VALKA has never taken an order from a 'Political' in his
          short life.

                         VALKA
          What?

                         JANUSZ
          Your knife.
          With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his
          knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ.
          While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims
          fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to
          make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They
          go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their
          digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a
          meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to
          cover their hide.

          AB47 EXT. THE HIDE, FOREST - DAY AB47

          Camera moves slowly toward their hide, wisps of vapor
          rise from below the surface. The Russian voices are
          closer now.

          AC47 INT. THE HIDE - DAY AC47

          It's like an Indian sweat-lodge as the fugitives sit
          shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle, ears straining,
          sweat running down their faces. The voices closer still.
          A tense moment, and then they are passing, the voices
          fading into silence.

          47 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, SIBERIA - NIGHT 47

          The strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally, and
          as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the
          snow from throat and lungs. VALKA, his arm wrapped
          defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his
          knees. JANUSZ turns back, drags him to his feet. KAZIK
          hangs onto the back of VOSS' coat, VOSS at times
          literally dragging him along.

          With VALKA's knife JANUSZ cuts a square of bark, pulls it
          from the tree, cuts two triangular holes some centimeters
          apart, then rams the base of the bark piece into VALKA'S
          collar. It's a crude mask.

          49 EXT. THE PROCESSION, FOREST - NIGHT 49

          The group, all now wearing the improvised snow-masks,
          push forward against the wind, looking like a tribe from
          some distant age dressed in ceremonial masks.

          50 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT. 50

          JANUSZ in the lead, some fifty paces ahead, but he's
          stopped, thigh-deep in the snow, as still as a statue.
          The others catch up, puzzled. SMITH calls to him, lifts
          his mask. He's asleep. SMITH shakes him back to
          consciousness, all the while the storm continues at full
          force.

                         SMITH
          We've got to make fire!

                         JANUSZ
          No! You saw how close they were!
          KAZIK sinks to the snow, then ZORAN.

                         SMITH
          We die either way, might as well
          die warm.

          A51 EXT. FOREST, LATER - NIGHT A51

          A hole scraped out of the snow and a wind-break of fallen
          timber, is all they can manage in their exhausted state.
          Down in the hole JANUSZ is striking a spark from a flint.
          Some are fading fast, KAZIK keeps falling asleep, to be
          shaken awake by TOMASZ. MR. SMITH is splitting wood into 
          ever finer shavings, ready to feed a nascent fire. Still
          the damp kindling will not catch.
          They draw closer together for warmth, draping their arms
          over each other's shoulders. ZORAN's head drops to his 
          chest. TOMASZ shakes him.

                         TOMASZ

          The other look to ZORAN, and fighting the desire to
          sleep, he begins. VALKA loves a good story, and despite
          their desperate situation he listens with the attention
          and concentration of a small child.

                         ZORAN
          Once upon a time, in the days of
          wooden ships, there was a great
          storm in far away seas. A
          merchant ship hurried toward big
          rocks, lightening in the sky, the
          waves as high as house-tops.
          Very, very cold, brrr! The ship
          smashed onto the rocks, the
          sailors cried in fear, called out
          to God, but they all drowned. All
          but one, Mr. Robinson Crusoe. He
          woke to find himself all alone on
          a desert island. For many years
          he lived without any human
          companions, until one day he saw
          something shocking! What was it?
          A human footprint. He was no
          longer alone. But was the
          stranger friend or foe? Another
          ship wrecked sailor? Or, a
          cannibal?
          All turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the 
          kindling. While JANUSZ blows at the flame, MR. SMITH 
          feeds in small shavings. The group watch with the awe 
          and wonder usually reserved for child-birth. Then
          everyone is making a contribution - adding a few leaves,
          or tiny twigs, like offerings, as the fire grows and
          spreads.

          AB51 EXT. FOREST, CAMPFIRE - DAWN AB51

          A comfortable blaze, the group, minus JANUSZ, sleep or
          drowse in the life-giving warmth, when a pile of snow
          lands on the fire. The others react. It's JANUSZ. He
          heaps on more snow and the fire sputters out.
          By the time the others are on their feet JANUSZ is almost
          out of sight and they hurry to catch up, fearful of being
          left behind.

          AC51 EXT./INT. SHELTER, FOREST - DAY AC51

          Ruins, deep in the forest. From the overgrown rubble
          they build a shelter, discovering as they do, evidence
          that this was once a small, remote, Soviet gulag.

          LATER, the fugitives sit shoulder to shoulder in a tight
          circle. They shiver in their padded jackets, rub frozen
          limbs. VALKA looks up to find SMITH staring at him.

                         VALKA
          You stare at me like the snake at
          the rabbit or is it the other
          way 'round?
          VALKA turns to the others with a silver-toothed smile,
          indicates SMITH.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          He teach me English. Speak good,
          huh? Bread for words, wasn't it
          cowboy?
          SMITH holds his gaze a moment before being distracted by
          a thumping sound outside. The group go very still. A
          second thump, overhead this time. VALKA draws his knife.
          A trickle of snow falls through the vent in the roof.

                         JANUSZ
          Snow, falling from trees.
          They relax a little.

          When can we travel by day?

                         JANUSZ

          How far have we come?

                         JANUSZ
          Twenty, thirty kilometers.

                         ZORAN
          Is that all?

                         VALKA
          Less, if we've been going in
          circles, like the chicken without
          its head.

                         TOMASZ

                         (TO JANUSZ)
          How can you tell we're heading
          South?

                         ZORAN
          He reads the trees, don't you?

                         JANUSZ
          Something like that.
          He spreads out a piece of cloth on the snow at his feet.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Alright, let's see what you've
          got.
          No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets,
          emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of
          bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a
          swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store
          of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of
          small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ,
          KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare
          grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items
          are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of
          barbed-wire, etc. SMITH picks up the barbed wire,
          examines it.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Valka?
          VALKA reluctantly reaches into his coat - something
          familiar about it with its distinctive fur-lined collar.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          That's Khabarov's coat.

          He smiles at JANUSZ as he produces a bulging sack from
          inside his coat.

          VALKA (CONT'D.)
          Yes...and...
          From the sack he produces KHABAROV's hoarded supply of 
          food and other items. Off JANUSZ's reaction - 

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          He was going to inform. Don't
          worry. I talk to him. Everything
          o.k.
          He puts the goods back in the sack and goes to place it 
          inside his coat. 

                         JANUSZ
          We share.
          JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances
          at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already
          begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of
          VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They
          eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the
          fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a
          thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats
          daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a
          tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions.

          AD51 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT. AD51

          The wind is rising, whipping flurries of snow through the
          trees. SMITH and JANUSZ are in the lead. SMITH refers
          back to VALKA.

                         SMITH
          You've made a bargain with the
          Devil.

          Have you got a knife?
          They move on in silence, JANUSZ not liking his bargain
          any more than SMITH.

          AE51 LATER, THAT NIGHT AE51
          SMITH finds himself walking beside VALKA.

          The group in the shelter of the trees. The sky is
          overcast but at least it's not too cold. Everywhere
          about is deep snow from the recent storm. TOMASZ
          prepares a meal from their dry rations, small portions
          for men who have expended so much energy. KAZIK examines
          his swollen blistered feet. VALKA has his boots off,
          shaking them.

          VALKA (TO KAZIK)
          Clean inside boots, foot-cloths.
          KAZIK copies him.

          With lengths of wood as 'ski-poles', the group begin to
          make up lost time. VOSS has lashed his rope-belt to
          KAZIK who walks behind him. SMITH wonders about this,
          but says nothing. They pause at the top of a rise
          amongst the trees, on hearing the sound of dogs howling
          from behind.

           JANUSZ a short distance away. He plants his 'ski-pole' 
           in the snow, marking the tip of its shadow with a pine- 
           cone. They watch as he draws a line in the snow from the 
          second marker - about a foot in length. Then he stands,
          and with the toe of his left foot at the first pine-cone
          and the toe of his right foot at the end of the line in
          the snow, he points, calling to them.

          Then you'll die.
          KAZIK has a far-away look in his sight-less eyes. He
          speaks in Polish to JANUSZ.

                         VOSS
          What does he say?

                         TOMASZ
          He asked Janusz if he believes in
          God's forgiveness.
          This has come from seemingly nowhere.

                         SMITH
          Save your philosophy. Concentrate
          on keeping up with us instead.
          He gets up and goes in search of more wood, the others
          surprised at his cold tone.
          The rest of the group also begin to prepare their camp.
          Most gather wood while TOMASZ, the 'quartermaster', makes
          their meal, and JANUSZ the fire. VOSS keeps an eye on
          KAZIK who, demonstrating his independence while it's
          still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a
          load of wood, turning back into the forest for more.
          Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take
          up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc.
          VOSS looks anxiously for KAZIK. He has not returned.

          KAZIK lost. He moves along a right to left trajectory,
          i.e. North, heading away for the campsite, his sight
          beginning to fade with the light.

          65 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 65

          The group range out from the fire calling KAZIK's name.
          VOSS turns to JANUSZ.

                         VOSS
          He has night-blindness.

          The PROF. sits beside him.

          PROF.
          Not far to go.
          He points, and KAZIK sees - the Pyramids of Giza, deep
          inside the fog.

                         KAZIK
          We made it. We really made it.
          Isn't that something.

          67 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 67

          They find KAZIK not a hundred yards from where they
          camped. The weather has broken, the fog gone. He sits
          looking toward them, his bare feet stretched out before
          him, his eyes wide open. On his lips a frozen smile.

          They stand by his grave.

          A free man died here today.
          Amens are muttered. The group remain by the grave
          reluctant to leave. All but VALKA who looks about
          restlessly.

                         VALKA
          Young always die first.

          Close on Nature naturing - birds calling from high

          And a large animal grazing. Or what appears at first to
          be an animal.
          It's VALKA, on all fours, picking up and eating bugs.
          Others are there grazing too. The weeks have taken their
          toll and they look thin and starving. We see in detail
          their search for anything edible: hands digging out
          roots and berries of various kinds which are tested with
          a tentative nibble and sometimes spat out if too bitter;

          and just beyond it a nut. A squirrel watches.
          Not all food is shared in this extreme situation and
          some, with a furtive look about them, eat what they find.

           They are camped at the mouth of a cathedral like cave,
           and here TOMASZ amuses himself by sketching on the cave
           wall using charcoal from the fire. Among portraits of
           the group are scenes from life in Camp 105. On the fire
           a stew of water and pine-needles bubbles away.
          ZORAN watches idly from where he lies near the cave
          entrance.

          fish, his day's catch. VOSS steps forward with a dead
          squirrel. VALKA has nothing. TOMASZ reaches for their
          cooking pot cooling by the fire. He passes a cup to

          Sleeping figures by the fire. TOMASZ tosses and turns,
          muttering in his sleep. JANUSZ is awake as is VALKA who
          sits close beside him. A whispered conversation -

                         VALKA
          Who will be first?
          JANUSZ looks at him.

                         JANUSZ
          You mean the first to die?
          VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ.

                         VALKA
          I think that sucker, the artist.
          But better if it was him.
          He nods toward ZORAN.

          It might be you.
          VALKA shrugs.

          Why 'better' if it's Zoran?
          VALKA squeezes the flesh of his upper arms.

                         VALKA
          More soft. More tender.
          JANUSZ shakes his head, 'no'.

          Mister only gets little fish now. 
          We must have meat, or we die. 
          You're the Pakhan, you've thought
          of it. We all have. That's why
          you brought extra people isn't it?
          For food? An old Urka escape
          trick. I swear to God you were an
          Urka in another life.

                         JANUSZ
          We'll get food when we get to Lake
          Baikal, plenty of fish there.

          It is ZORAN's turn on watch and he stands near the
          entrance to the cave, his blanket about his shoulders,
          looking out into the still night. Behind him a low
          growling sound, coming from deep in the cave. He turns,
          a look of terror on his face. He can see nothing but a
          dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates
          through two large holes in the cave roof. He wakes
          JANUSZ, alerting him to the sound. JANUSZ in turn wakes
          VALKA, and after taking burning sticks from the fire they
          walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the
          sound, VALKA drawing his knife.

          75 INT. CAVE - NIGHT


                          75 
          The dim light shows a wolf-pack growling as they pick at
          a carcass on the cave floor. They drop their bones and
          face the intruders, baring their fangs, all now growling.
          On a signal from JANUSZ they rush the wolves, who run
          back toward another exit from the cave. MR. SMITH,
          TOMASZ and VOSS come hurrying to join them, woken by all
          the barking and shouting.
          VALKA falls on part of the carcass, cutting off chunks of
          raw meat. The others do likewise. Wider on the group,
          down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill,
          only JANUSZ stands back, watching them.

          EXT./INT. CAVE - EARLY MORNING 76

          Some sleep on, others stir, their movements slow and
          listless. They are near the end. This has been JANUSZ's
          point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his
          pockets and picks up his staff. Those awake stare at
          him.

                         JANUSZ
          I'll be back in a week - if I find
          the lake. If not, you're on your
          own.

                         VALKA

          Smith will be the Pakhan while I'm
          gone.
          JANUSZ turns and with a nod of the head 'follow me', to
          SMITH, he moves off.

          77 EXT. SOME DISTANCE FROM CAMP - DAWN 77

          Now out of earshot, JANUSZ turns to SMITH. SMITH knows
          what it's about.

                         SMITH
          I know. Valka.

                         JANUSZ
          Don't let him out of your sight.

          78 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY, SIBERIA - DAY 78

          A magnificent vista - a broad plain sweeping toward a
          distant line of hills. It's a beautiful clear day and
          the lone figure of JANUSZ, dwarfed by the landscape,
          walks steadily Southward.

          79 EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DUSK 79 

          Sheltering from the wind on the leeside of a hill, he
          takes pine-cones from his pocket, breaks them open and
          eats the seeds. Then he's up and off again, leaning
          heavily on his staff.

          80 EXT. A BARREN PLAIN - DAY 80

          The weather changes from a clear Spring morning to cold
          and overcast as gusts of wind whip down from distant
          slopes. JANUSZ bends into the wind, his pace slowing.
          He stumbles, sinks to the ground, fighting the desire to
          let go, to give himself to sleep, and the swift death
          that will surely follow. His eyes begin to close. Then
          he sees it. Just ahead of him. The gate. The gate from
          his vision in the mine. He struggles to his feet,
          staggers on -

          JANUSZ'S VISION: A repeat of his earlier hallucination -
          the click of the gate latch, the flagstones at his feet
          as he moves down the path. (All the while the
          accompanying sound is of JANUSZ's laboured breathing in
          the present 'reality'). He's at the front door, camera
          pans to the loose brick in the wall beside the door.

          81 EXT. CAMPSITE, FOREST - DUSK 81

          JANUSZ staggers back into camp, half dead and shivering
          with cold. VALKA is quickly beside him with SMITH and

          VOSS.

                         JANUSZ
          Three days from here. South by
          West.
          He collapses. VOSS shouts for the fire to be built up,
          hot water to be boiled. He feels his pulse, checks his
          eyes.

                         VOSS
          Stones! Gather stones! Heat them
          in the fire!

          82 EXT. CAMPSITE, STILL LATER - NIGHT 82

          Throughout the night they take turns replacing the hot
          stones surrounding his body and massaging his feet and
          hands. On one such occasion SMITH finds himself at
          JANUSZ's side. JANUSZ opens his eyes.

                         SMITH
          What's the 'brick'?

                         JANUSZ
          What did I say?

                         SMITH
          Something about a loose brick.
          JANUSZ nods, offers no explanation.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You know if you don't pull through
          soon we'll have to leave you.

                         JANUSZ
          I expect nothing less.

          you want to see home again.

                         JANUSZ
          We could've used you in the Polish
          army. Fired you out of a cannon.

          toward the crest of the hill.

           From the crest, a panorama of Lake Baikal - a massive 
           body of water stretching to the horizon. 
           The fugitives rest, and consider the next stage of their

                         VALKA
          I swear to God, those mother-

          take them to secret police. Get
          more for us than they would for

          SMITH and VOSS are last in line as they move cautiously
          along a dirt track. SMITH keeps looking back over his
          shoulder.

          SMITH signals JANUSZ to stop, while holding a finger to
          his lips for silence. JANUSZ joins him, followed by the
          others.

                         SMITH
          We're being followed.

                         JANUSZ
          Followed? Where?

                         SMITH
          Fifty yards back. A man on his
          own. May have seen us - crossed
          into the trees beside the track.
          A silence as they consider their options. VALKA draws
          his knife.

                         VOSS
          No killing.

                         VALKA

                         (TO VOSS)
          No? I think you've killed before.
          You say too many prayers for an
          innocent man.
          VOSS looks uneasy.

                         SMITH
          He gives us away, the soldiers
          will be on us in no time.

                         JANUSZ
          Valka, go back on the other side
          of the track, then come up behind,
          in case he makes a run for it.
          VALKA moves off, gliding through the trees on the left of
          the track. The others wait a beat, then move into the
          trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen
          timber as weapons.
          JANUSZ is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces
          ahead, a figure steps out from behind a tree. JANUSZ
          stops, holding up a hand for the others to stay where
          they are. He stares at the small figure - a young woman.
          There's a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat, a
          scarf tied loosely about her neck. Wisps of chestnut
          hair stray out from under a moth-eaten fur hood. She
          looks frightened and desperate.

          From her waif like appearance, it's hard to tell her age
          - an old thirteen or a young sixteen?
          The men discreetly drop their irovised weapons. She
          looks ready to make a run for it on seeing VALKA with his
          drawn knife. JANUSZ gestures for the others to fall
          back, as he cautiously approaches, uttering reassuring
          words.

          89 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - LATER - DAY 89

          The others sit smoking by the pathway, watching as JANUSZ
          crosses back from the GIRL to join them.
          He says something to TOMASZ in Polish. A rapid exchange
          between them.

                         SMITH
          What? What is it?

                         JANUSZ
          She's Polish. Been following us
          for several days.

                         VALKA
          What does she want?

                         JANUSZ
          Food? Protection? She's been too
          afraid to approach us until she
          was sure we weren't Russians.

                         SMITH
          She wants to travel with us?

          thousands like that, less use than
          a dog!

          clearing.

                         ZORAN
          Maybe it's kinder to leave her.

                         VOSS
          She's been sent to us. We can't
          leave her.

          JANUSZ knows this is true.

          90 EXT.THE CLEARING, WOODS - DAY 90

           The GIRL watches as JANUSZ approaches. From the way he
           doesn't look at her she knows their answer. JANUSZ
           stands before her a moment. They speak in Polish (sub-
          titled).

                         JANUSZ
          I'm sorry.
          He reaches into his bag, passes her a fish and some nuts
          and berries. It's all she can do to refrain from eating
          it right away.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)

          Go back.
          He guesses at what this might mean.

                         JANUSZ
          If we had enough food
          She stares at him, nods, then walks back toward the path,
          returning in the direction from which she came.

          The group walk in silence, the encounter with the girl

          LATER, the group walking out in the open by the lake when
          their attention is caught by the sight of a flock of
          ravens circling and diving on something up ahead - just
          out of sight around a bend in the lake.

          93 EXT. LAKESIDE, MOMENTS LATER - DAY 93

          SMITH is the first to see it - a full grown reindeer
          bogged to the shoulders in the soft mud by the lake's
          edge. As they approach the ravens rise in a great
          flapping of wings. The group circle the wild-eyed beast,
          pathetic in it's attempts to pull itself out of the bog,
          faced now with this new and more deadly threat. VALKA
          draws his knife.

          94 EXT. A COVE, LAKESIDE - DAY 94

          TOMASZ already has a fire going when the rest of the
          party appear dragging the carcass of the reindeer on an
          improvised sled made of driftwood. VOSS watches a moment
          as preparations are made to butcher the animal, then he
          turns and hurries back in the direction from which they
          came. JANUSZ watches him. He knows where he's going.

          VOSS moving fast beside the lake, then onto the track,
          running now, retracing their steps.

          TOMASZ butchers more meat from the reindeer using VALKA's
          knife, while SMITH sets up a wooden rotisserie on the
          fire assisted by ZORAN. JANUSZ and VALKA are part way
          through skinning the beast when they pause on hearing
          footsteps. Around the point comes VOSS, followed by the
          girl. As they approach, an expectant silence.

          Her name is, Irena.

          97 EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER - NIGHT 97

          They eat in silence, savoring every mouthful. We hear
          the sounds of eating - bones sucked to the marrow;
          fingers licked; bones crunching.

          JANUSZ has been on the last watch of the night, and as
          dawn breaks he approaches his sleeping companions. He
          stares down at IRENA, sleeping like a child by the fire.
          Slowly the others stir, all moving slowly and quietly,
          not wanting to disturb her sleep.

          99 EXT. LAKESIDE, CAMPSITE - DAY 99

          ZORAN has set himself up as camp barber - trimming hair
          and shaving heads using the razor-blade inserted in the
          end of a stick, and for shaving cream, a chunk of fat
          from the reindeer. JANUSZ has just been shaved and
          trimmed, the last but for VALKA. While the others wash
          themselves and their clothes, ZORAN calls for VALKA, who
          approaches reluctantly and sits on the rock before the
          barber.

          Very still, please.
          He tilts VALKA's neck, seemingly the better to shave him.
          In fact, he enjoys teasing VALKA and his movements are 
          slow and ominous, VALKA clearly nervous.

          VALKA; With the 'Wolf' he separates sinews and tendons
          from the beast, to form much needed bindings for their
          journey. He also cuts meat for their jerked supply, or
          to be smoked.

                          
          SMITH; Makes firstly a large bone needle, then later

                          
          makes repairs in his clothes.
          ZORAN; After cleaning his teeth with a twig, hangs his
          suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a
          branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests
          he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting
          the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant
          of the 'bone-bank'. 'Customers' come to him looking for
          bones or teeth for various uses.
          JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he
          stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts
          a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He
          also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat
          and fat.
          IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she
          seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes
          her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and
          whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she
          reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all
          affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a
          young woman when she returns washed, and wearing the
          dress she has carried rolled-up on her back.

          101 EXT. CAMPFIRE, LAKESIDE - NIGHT 101

          SMITH and JANUSZ some distance from the campsite
          collecting wood. By the fire ZORAN leads the 'Survivors
          Band'. He has them drumming on logs, tapping sticks,
          harmonizing, amid much laughter. JANUSZ watches IRENA.
          Then he turns to SMITH.

                         JANUSZ
          She's educated. Speaks good
          English. And French.

                         SMITH
          That right.

                         JANUSZ
          You don't like her, do you?

                         SMITH
          Speak to Valka about her. He
          doesn't even think she's Polish.

                         JANUSZ
          I did speak to him. And the
          others. They agree she comes with
          us.

                         SMITH
          It's decided then?

                         JANUSZ
          You disagree.

                         SMITH
          Apart from food she'll slow us
          down. There's no room for
          sentimentality. You know that.

          And he turns, moving back to the fire with his load of
          wood.

          102 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - DAY 102

          Refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from
          the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track
          by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to
          her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH
          she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up
          with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to
          charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years.

          103 EXT. RIVER/LAKE - DAY


                         103
          A river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle. They
          walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow,
          but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with
          JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their
          weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man,
          a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their
          side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim
          for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer
          clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots
          about their necks. IRENA watches.

                         SMITH
          Can you swim?

                         IRENA
          Yes, Mister.

                         SMITH
          You wouldn't lie to me?

                         IRENA
          I'm not lying, Comrade.
          That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy
          by it.

                         SMITH
          And don't call me, 'comrade'.
          With a shout the group plunge into the icy water,
          swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level
          in the other. It's only when they reach the other side
          they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The 
          others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment
          then runs upstream to where the river is frozen.

                         103 CONTINUED: 103
          They watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and
          bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite
          bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times
          it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over
          a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other
          side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on
          her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is
          worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to 
          follow him into the tree-line.

          A106 EXT. FOREST, A SHORT TIME LATER - DAY A106 

           They scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional 
           backward glances to see if the hunter is following. 
           There's no sign of him. 

          106 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 106

           Some time later the group, still a little damp, walk by 
          the lake. IRENA walks beside SMITH whose long strides
          force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at
          mosquitoes as they walk.

                         SMITH
          Janusz tells me your family were
          Kulaks?

                         IRENA
          Yes. Just a cow and some pigs.

                         SMITH
          Were your parents arrested with
          you?

                         IRENA
          They're dead.
          She swats at a few mosquitos hovering around her face.

                         IRENA (CONT'D)
          We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.
          When the Russians came they said
          we were 'kulaks', and exploiting
          the peasants. My parents were
          afraid and hid me in the barn.
          The mosquitos are getting worse and SMITH grabs swatches
          of leaves, passing one to IRENA as they walk on, swinging
          away at the annoying insects.

          strangled with barbed wire.

          Later, the Russians caught me, and
          sent me to a collective farm.
          They were cruel to me. I ran
          away. I had no food. Then I saw
          you.

                         HER TEARS
          They walk in silence a few paces, and she dries
          with the corner of her sleeve.

                         SMITH
          You can't swim can you?
          She looks up at him.

                         IRENA
          What?

                         SMITH
          You've never been in the water in
          your life.
          She laughs coquettishly.

                         IRENA
          But I got across, didn't I?

                         SMITH
          And, you said you lived on a farm
          near Warsaw?
          IRENA puzzled.

                         IRENA
          Yes.

                         SMITH
          The Soviets didn't get that far.
          That was German territory.
          She nervously swats the mosquitos.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          Your parents weren't murdered were
          they? You made it all up.
          pinched,
          She won't look at him, her face looks thin and
          she seems older.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We've all done terrible things to
          survive. But don't ever lie to me
          again. We've had enough of lies.

          the weathered face of a fisherman. He's heard something.
          He crosses to the window, peers out into the darkness.
          The moment he turns away the camera moves on around the
          side to the rear of the building, past a rabbit in a
          cage. VALKA's shoulder comes into frame as he edges his
          way toward the back door, passing the sightless skull of

          He releases him and VALKA staggers back, reaching down to
          a bulging sack. He tips out the contents - various 
          foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle
          of vodka.

                         VALKA
          'Fool' is it?
          It's then they notice blood splashed over his trousers.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          What? Did I kill you ask? Yes.
          A dog.

                         (HE LAUGHS)
          Don't believe me? So don't eat.
          But you will won't you? Because
          you want survival. I know about
          survival! All my life.
          He holds up the bottles of vodka, one half empty

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          And it's my birthday!
          With a wild look in his eyes, he passes a bottle to
          JANUSZ, then flicks the side of his neck with his middle
          finger.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In Russia that means we drink!

                         

                         

                         

                         
            67.

          112 EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER - NIGHT 112

          TOMASZ tends the rabbit roasting on the fire, while the
          vodka bottle is passed hand to hand. When not drinking,
          the group are swatting at the persistent mosquitoes,
          ZORAN now badly bitten. VALKA doesn't seem bothered by
          the mosquitoes, perhaps tatoos keep them away, anyway
          he's feeling generally pleased with himself and is very
          talkative.

                         VALKA
          You know when they put the
          children of the political
          prisoners in the orphanage, they
          change their names, so later, the
          parents can never find them.

                         ZORAN
          Is that what happened to you?

                         VALKA
          (shakes his head)
          I didn't have parents. But that's
          what happened to her.
          He passes IRENA the bottle. She glares back at him.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Isn't it? You told me that.
          She glances at the puzzled faces of the others, finally
          looking at SMITH. He holds her gaze. Then she takes a
          slug of the vodka.

                         IRENA
          They called me 'Rykov', but I
          remembered our Polish name -
          'Zulinski'. I used to say it
          every night before I went to
          sleep.

                         JANUSZ
          The story you told us

                         IRENA (OVERLAP)
          I thought that story would be more
          sad, and you wouldn't leave me
          behind.
          Again she looks at SMITH. She made a promise to him.

                         VALKA
          She lived in the streets, like me!
          He breaks into one of his Urki songs. IRENA translates.

                         IRENA
          It's about a mother complaining to
          her son that he's a thief, just
          like his father... it goes on and
          says, 'but if you are strong
           enough to fight 'til death - you
           will conquer fate'.
           She joins VALKA in the chorus.

          113 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 113 

           The mosquitos continue to plaguethem,swirling in clouds 
           about their heads, crawling intoears,eyes and mouths. 
           They have improvised headgear -coats,swatches of 
           leaves, improvised masks. Many are badly bitten, faces 
           swollen, bites infected. SMITH walks beside JANUSZ. 

                          SMITH 
           What can we do? Steal a boat? 

                          JANUSZ

          A114 LATER, PLOUGHED FIELD - DAY A114 
           The group collect potatoes in a ploughed field by the 
           lake. ZORAN can no longer take the mosquitoes, and to 
           the astonishment of the others, he runs toward the water, 
           shedding his coat as he goes, eventually diving into the 
           water and submerging himself. 

          114 EXT. LAKESIDE, LATER - DAY 114 

          From a concealed position in the trees they watch as half
          a dozen peasants walk by the lake. ZORAN studies them
          intently.

                         ZORAN

                         (A WHISPER)
          No mosquitos.
          The others unsure of his meaning.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)

          115 EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS, LAKESIDE - DAY/DUSK 115

          The group have by now a walking routine which they rarely
          vary, always occupying the same positions in extended
          line. JANUSZ as navigator in the lead, SMITH generally
          bringing up the rear. IRENA is the exception - varying
          her place, now with one, now with another. They don't
          talk much to each other as they walk but they do talk
          with her. She has the knack of getting anyone to talk.
          No doubt a skill learnt in her life on the streets.

          116 EXT. FOREST NEAR THE ROAD - DAY 116

           A small fire burns as TOMASZ cooks a fish stolen by 
           VALKA. The smoke from the fire is not enough to 
          alleviate the mosquito problem and the group swat in
          miserable silence. Suddenly SMITH throws dirt on the
          fire, suffocating it with his jacket. He points to the
          road.

          117 EXT. ROAD - DAY 117

          From their point of view a fisherman in his fifties, a 
          basket in a sling on his back, walks abreast of them on 
          the track.

          118 EXT. FOREST - DAY 118

          As he passes, ZORAN speaks in a whisper to JANUSZ.

                         ZORAN
          There it is! Again!
          JANUSZ mystified.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Look at him.
          JANUSZ stares again at the man.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          No mosquitos!
          ZORAN is up and off before anyone can stop him. They
          watch in appalled silence as he approaches and speaks to
          the man, who regards this stranger appearing from the
          forest with some suspicion. ZORAN does a kind of crazy
          dance, talking all the while.

          Soon the man is laughing, and putting down his bag and
          gun he takes something from around his neck and places it
          on ZORAN's neck. A few more words, and more laughter,
          then with a handshake ZORAN heads back into the forest,
          the man continuing on his way. ZORAN rejoins them,
          holding up the gift from the old man - strands of
          intertwined bark.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Mosquito repellent! And I have
          the formula!

          LATER. They all wear necklaces of the entwined bark and
          are mosquito free. ZORAN is the hero of the hour.

                         TOMASZ
          But what did you say to him?

                         ZORAN
          That I was an escaped convict who
          was being plagued by mosquitos.
          As they round a bend and disappear from sight, TOMASZ's
          voice drifts back.

          TOMASZ (V.O.)
          Very funny. But what did you
          really say?

          JANUSZ scoops up a handful of water where it laps a
          beach. It's a symbolic end to their lake trek, and they
          turn and walk on, the lake behind them.

          120 EXT. A FIELD, SIBERIA - DAY 120

          In the far distance a large town dominated by a
          collection of smoke stacks, belching out columns of smoke
          into the sky, as the group hurry across open ground to
          the shelter of the forest.

          TOMASZ surprised at his tone.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Why should you care what I'm
          making?
          The evening is hot and VALKA has his shirt open, the
          tattooed portraits of Lenin and Stalin on his chest
          appear and disappear in the folds of his shirt. This
          amuses ZORAN.

                         ZORAN
          Valka?

                         VALKA
          What?

                         ZORAN
          Why do you have arseholes tattooed
          on your chest?
          VALKA stops. Stares back.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Shouldn't they be on your arse so
          you sit on them every time you
          take a shit?

                         VALKA
          You think it's funny? They are
          great men.
          ZORAN laughs.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Watch your eyes, crowbait!
          He makes a 'V' with his fingers followed by a short 
          stabbing motion. ZORAN reels back.

                          

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Don't you know what 'Stalin' means
          funny man? Man-of-Steel. He
          takes from rich and gives to poor.

                         ZORAN
          Sure he does. Then he puts both
          of them in a camp for twenty-five
          years.
          VALKA goes back to his carving.

          A127 EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS - NIGHT A127

          JANUSZ stands on the tracks lookingdownthelinetoa
          cutting where the track disappearsaroundabend.The
          sound of an approaching train, a dim light already
          reflected on the side of the cutting. He turns and looks
          toward the trees where the others are approaching down a
          wooded hillside. He hurries toward them, urging them to
          take cover in the bracken beside the track. SMITH points
          out a glowing red light further down the track from the
          approaching train.

          AB127 EXT. RAILWAY TRACK - NIGHT AB127 

           The train thunders into the cutting with a squeal of 
           breaks as the driver sights the red light on the track 
           ahead, and the train slows to a stop. 

          127 EXT. BESIDE THE TRACK - NIGHT 127 

           Close on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the 
           carriages stopped in front of them. They are cattle- 
           cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From 
           the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars.
           From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, 
           female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized 
           faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy.
           Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and
           from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and
           urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly 
           moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop
           to the tracks from the barred windows.
           After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the 
           woods on the other side, all but VOSS. He is picking up 
          as many of the notes and letters as he can.

          JANUSZ (V.O.)
          Andrejs, for God's sake!
          VOSS slowly crosses the tracks, and disappears into the
          brush.

          128 EXT. BRUSH, TRACKSIDE - NIGHT 128

          VOSS, overwhelmed with emotion sits down, examining the
          letters and notes in his hand. JANUSZ hurries back for
          him.

          Come on!
          But VOSS doesn't move. JANUSZ sits beside him, and VOSS
          passes him a sample of the prisoners' pathetic messages -
          some scrawled on the back of photographs. They are
          mostly names and addresses, pleas for someone to mail or
          inform relatives of what happened to them - some have
          even clipped a few bank-notes to pay for postage.

           Tall striped posts at intervals, strung with rusted wire -
          beyond, a dirt road and distant fields. From a concealed
          position in the nearby trees they carefully watch for
          signs of a patrol. JANUSZ goes first, passing easily
          through the sagging fence. ZORAN calls to him.

                         (SHOUTS)
          What's it like in Mongolia?
          JANUSZ holds up a hand - 'Keep your voice down'. ZORAN
          crawls through the wire followed by the others.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          I love Mongolia.

                         SMITH
          Love it later. We need to get as
          far from this border as possible.
          ZORAN faces Russia and as if bowing at the end of a
          performance.

                         ZORAN
          Thank you Mother Russia for your
          hospitality! I definitely will
          not be coming back!
          It's only then that we notice that VALKA has not crossed
          through. He stands staring at them from the Soviet side.
          It's clear he's going no further. JANUSZ crosses back to
          him, and they talk through the wire.

          Prison is o.k. Debt is bad. But
          there are many prisons. They
          don't find me.
          They stand a moment, watching the others moving toward a
          line of trees.

                         JANUSZ
          No, America?

                         VALKA
          It's not for me - 'Freedom'.
          Wouldn't know what to do with it,
          I swear to God.
          He places his hand on the wooden hilt of his knife,
          sticking out of his waistband.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          So we must say goodbye, my Wolf
          and me.

          Good luck, Pakhan.
          And he turns and walks away. JANUSZ walks toward the
          distant group and by the time he looks back, VALKA is
          gone.

          A vast plain stretches to distant snow-capped peaks.
          Dotted on the hills the Gers - circular tent-like
          structures, home to the nomadic Mongolians. In the
          distance walk the band of survivors, strung out in a line
          abreast. Their voices drift back - snatches of
          conversation., and laughter.

          Around a bend, a decorative archway over the road, a town
          visible a few miles further on. They stop in their
          tracks. On one side of the timber structure a portrait
          of Josef Stalin. On the other the local Mongolian
          leader, a red star on his military cap. In the centre,
          the hammer and sickle over a painting of a brown hand
          shaking a white one. Small flags of both nations flap
          ominously.

          Their religion would compel them
          to shelter us. We could go to

          half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily,
          takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS
          drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep
          retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase
          is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a

          Within a walled compound they wander between a series of
          recently abandoned Buddhist temples and out-buildings.
          By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may
          have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence -
          doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies
          smashed in a courtyard. JANUSZ points to a line of
          bullet impacts, stitched across a wall.

          Valka knew somehow. Knew I'd
          killed in cold blood.
          He bows his head. IRENA looks up at him, and they stand
          together in silence, but for the moaning wind.

          141 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAY 141

          As they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts
          when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian
          horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle
          them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear
          the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age
          from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy.
          The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH,
          figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader.
          The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in
          Russian, a rough guttural accent.

          [THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE IS IN RUSSIAN.]

                         OLD MAN
          Russki?
          A glance between SMITH and JANUSZ. Much may hang on his
          answer.

                         SMITH
          No. American.
          The OLD MAN maybe doesn't get the 'American' part, but he
          gets that they are not Russian. He seems pleased about
          that.

                         OLD MAN
          Lhasa?
          SMITH nods.

                         SMITH
          Lhasa. Yes. Tibet.
          JANUSZ points South.

                         OLD MAN
          Pilgrim?

                         SMITH
          Yes.

                         OLD MAN
          No horses?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         
            82.

                         141 CONTINUED: 141

                         SMITH
          We are too poor to have horses.
          The OLD MAN points at IRENA.

                         OLD MAN
          Wife?
          SMITH looks at IRENA.

                         SMITH
          Daughter.
          IRENA moves closer to him. SMITH puts a protective arm
          about her shoulder. The OLD MAN considers the situation
          for a moment longer before abruptly turning, and followed
          by his band, galloping off toward the distant hills.
          Looks between the group, not exactly of relief, as
          there's a feeling it may not be the last they see of the
          riders. IRENA looks up at SMITH, smiles at him.
          Something about him calling her his daughter has touched
          some hidden place. SMITH, a little embarrassed, smiles
          back.

          142 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE, MONGOLIA - DAY 142

          While SMITH fishes in the river, others tend to their
          battered feet. VOSS passes around deer fat in his
          improvised deer skull container. This they rub over raw
          patches, and between their toes where deep cracks have
          developed. JANUSZ repairs their footwear, while TOMASZ
          sits by the fire sketching IRENA. ZORAN, the camp
          barber, trims hairs and beards

          143 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 143

          TOMASZ is smoking fish over the fire as the group stir.
          He gives ZORAN a kick.

                         ZORAN
          What did you do that for? I was
          in the middle of this beautiful
          dream - just about to eat some
          salt, I could already taste it. I
          want to go back to that dream.

          144 EXT. STEPPES, MONGOLIA, LATER - DAY 144

          The figures seen walking away in the distance. Floating
          back the voice of TOMASZ giving a recipe of a favorite
          Polish dish to ZORAN.

          Then add two sprigs of rosemary
          and a pinch of nutmeg.

                         ZORAN
          Nutmeg? What about the salt?

                         TOMASZ
          We'll get to that. Now, add the
          oil and leave it to marinate,
          while you prepare the chicken.
          That's where the salt comes in...

                         ZORAN
          Good.

                         TOMASZ
          Rub it into the skin of the
          chicken with a little of the
          paprika.

                         Z ORAN
          Double the salt.

                         TOMASZ
          I can't just double the salt!
          It'll be too salty.

                         ZORAN
          I don't care, just do it.

                         TOMASZ
          I'm not going to ruin it.

          145 EXT. A CHANGING LANDSCAPE, MONGOLIA - DAY 145

           A primaeval and austerely beautiful landscape stretches 
          before them. Tufty knolls of dry grass are the only
          detail that break up the flat immensity.

          146 RIDGE-TOP - DAY 146
          Up ahead of them on the edge of a ridge a lone Mongolian
          horseman watches them approach. He's the young boy from
          the group of horseman who originally approached them.
          They pause before him. He looks at them a moment then
          tosses a goatskin bag at their feet before galloping off
          in the direction from which they came. VOSS picks up the
          skin bag, gives it a shake. Water.
          They continue on to the edge of the ridge and a view of a 
          vast desert plain is revealed.

          They look back to the disappearing horseman before
          scrambling down the rocky slope.

          A147 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY A147

          The group crossing into the heart of the Gobi.

          147 EXT. GOBI DESERT, LATER - DAY 147

          VOSS is the first to see it - a vast glittering lake.
          They hurry toward it.

          148 LATER, 148
          The lake leads them on, but appears no closer.

          149 LATER STILL, 149
          JANUSZ has taken a reading of the sun, using his stick
          method. He points out their direction - it is away from
          the beckoning lake.

                         VOSS
          Janusz!
          JANUSZ hesitates, looks at VOSS who holds up their water-
          bag.

          VOSS (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
          We should go to the lake. Water
          is getting low.

                         JANUSZ
          What lake? It's a mirage.
          He plods on, away from the shimmering vision. There's
          little the others can do but trust JANUSZ, and slowly
          they follow.

          150 EXT. THE GOBI - MIDDAY/DUSK 150

          The sun is directly above, the land shimmering with heat
          The group have stuck their sticks in the ground and
          draped their jackets over them, making a sunshade they
          SHELTER under.

          151 LATER, 151
          The sun has dropped, casting shadows. JANUSZ rises from
          the shelter and calls for the others to continue.

          152 EXT. THE GOBI - ANOTHER DAY 152

          The figures, tiny in the surrounding desert, walk on,
          JANUSZ in the lead needing to constantly slow down to
          allow the others to catch up.

          A153 EXT. THE GOBI - SAME DAY A153

          The group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up
          ahead. Nothing on the horizon. Then they are hit by a
          fierce wind, as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand.
          They drop to the ground instinctively, and huddled
          together throw blankets around their shoulders and over
          their heads, as they are engulfed in the choking sand.
          LATER, they emerge from their own 'dune', and shaking 
          themselves down they resume their journey southward. 

          153 EXT. THE GOBI - NIGHT 153

          The temperature has dropped to freezing and they huddle
          by a fire, picking sand out of their small ration of
          food.

                         ZORAN
          I'm too tired to sleep.

                         TOMASZ
          Why not keep walking?

                         ZORAN
          I'm for that, if we can wake
          Andrejs.
          They look to where VOSS sleeps.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          He can sleep anywhere, any time.
          How does he do it?

          He points upward to the low clouds obscuring the stars.

                         SMITH
          What about water?

                         SMITH
          I don't see any. I'm trying to
          remember my school geography but I
          seem to recall the Gobi Desert
          somewhere in Southern Mongolia.
          JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground.
          It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch
          as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their
          cooking pot in the base.

                         JANUSZ
          We may pick up a little morning
          dew.
          Glad of something practical to do they all set about
          digging and lining holes with anything to hand.

          154 EXT. THE GOBI - DAWN 154

          As they wake, they harvest the precious droplets of water
          caught overnight, trickling the contents into their pot,
          barely a quarter cupful.

          155 EXT. GOBI - DAY 155

          No-one has slept much and they walk like zombies, strung
          out in a line, no-one speaking, all just dully
          concentrating on placing one foot after the other. ZORAN
          notices VOSS, walking behind him is actually asleep. He
          has swung his backpack onto his chest and with his head
          resting on it he is actually sleep-walking. ZORAN tests
          his theory by walking away from the group, in a small
          circle. VOSS follows, guided by the sound of ZORAN's
          footsteps. He wakes him, VOSS looking around with a
          start.

                         ZORAN
          You were asleep!

                         VOSS
          No I wasn't.

                         ZORAN
          You were following the sound of my
          footsteps - sleep-walking.
          The others have stopped. ZORAN takes the backpack from
          VOSS, and places it on the exhausted IRENA.

          Put all else out of your mind, and
          sleep. I'll wake you in Calcutta.
          She smiles, nods, already half asleep.

          ZORAN looks over his shoulder, smiles proudly as he sees
          IRENA is sleep-walking, trusting to the steady sound of
          his footsteps.

          157 EXT. GOBI MID-DAY 157

          The group rest under the meagre shade provided by their
          coats. SMITH walks away from them, and crests a slight
          rise. From here he has a clear view to the horizon. Off
          in the distance a dark patch against the light sand.
          Through the dancing mid-day light he sees shapes. Trees?
          He staggers back to the group.

                         SMITH
          Janusz?
          JANUSZ follows him to the rise. SMITH points to his
          discovery. JANUSZ squints against the light.

                         JANUSZ
          It's another mirage.
          SMITH shakes his head 'no'.

          We have no more water. I see
          trees. Where there's trees
          there's water.

                         JANUSZ
          It's East. We must head South.
          The others have joined them, staring toward the distant
          shape.

          Not once. But we must give it a
          try.

                         JANUSZ
          No. We must keep going South!
          You'll kill us all!

                         SMITH
          Damn it, we're already dying.
          JANUSZ goes to move on, SMITH grabs his shirt sleeve, a
          short pathetic struggle sees them fall to their knees,
          VOSS and TOMASZ move to separate them. SMITH is the
          first to stand, brushing sand and dirt from his clothes.
          He turns to the others.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You have a choice.
          He looks at IRENA, then turns and goes back for his staff
          and jacket. The others watch as he turns East toward his
          discovery.

                         JANUSZ
          It's a mirage. Just a mirage.
          SMITH keeps walking away - a strange echo of the incident
          in Siberia when he walked away from the guards. Perhaps
          it is this memory that causes the others to turn
          silently, and collecting their few possessions, to follow
          him. JANUSZ watches a while, then slowly follows.

          MORE SOLID TREES.
          Back on ZORAN.

                         ZORAN
          Mirages don't have birds!
          Wider, and they're running, running with the last of
          their precious energy.

          161 EXT. WELL - DAY 161

          A clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well
          - a low square of ancient stones. They sprawl by the
          well, SMITH reaching down inside with their bowl to bring
          up a scoop of crystal clear water. It's passed around
          rapidly.

                         SMITH
          Just a little. Don't fill
          yourselves.
          More scoops follow in quick succession, enough to splash
          hands and faces.
          VOSS calls from a few yards away.

                         VOSS
          Fire. Coals are still warm.
          SMITH and JANUSZ join him, examining the ground about the
          fire.

                         SMITH
          Lots of tracks. Nomads?

                         VOSS
          Maybe others will come?

                         TOMASZ
          Over here! The remains of a meal!
          There's still meat on the bones!
          He points to the cooked remains of some animal. Using
          VOSS's deer-bone knife he scrapes meat from the bones,
          others just attacking any bone they find.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         161 CONTINUED: 161

                         JANUSZ
          Don't eat it all!
          He manages to save at least half of the meat, wrapping it
          in a cloth, and putting it in VOSS's backpack.

          162 EXT. WELL, LATER - DAY 162

          They lie stretched out under the shade of the trees
          dozing, and every now and then going back to the well to
          drink or just to lay their hands in the cool water.

          163 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 163

          IRENA sleeps while the men discuss their situation in
          hushed tones.

                         TOMASZ
          At least we have water here.

                         JANUSZ
          But no food.

                         VOSS
          Other nomads will come. Water
          their flocks.

                         JANUSZ
          When? Next week? Next month?

                         ZORAN
          We could wait a few days, at
          least.

                         JANUSZ
          Without food, we'll only get
          weaker. Maybe too weak to travel.

                         TOMASZ
          These last days - I don't know
          that I could go through that
          again.

                         VOSS
          (looks at the water)
          It was a miracle finding this.
          Can we count on another?

                         TOMASZ
          I say we stay.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         163 CONTINUED: 163
          They look to SMITH. He looks up to find them watching
          him.

                         SMITH
          What are you looking at me for?
          Ask Janusz. He's already made up
          his mind for us, haven't you,
          Janusz?
          JANUSZ says nothing.

          164 EXT.WELL - DAWN 164

           They all take a last drink from the well, then pour water
           over their faces and clothes. VOSS fills the skin water-
           bag, then ZORAN fills their cooking bowl to the brim.
          Steamis rising from their damp clothing when they set
          off. ZORAN walking on tip-toe, anxiousnot to spill a
          dropfrom the bowl in his outstretchedhand.

          165 EXT.GOBI DESERT - DAY 165

           Close on TOMASZ as he looks back over his shoulder to

                         SEE:

           THE WELL, STILL NOT MORE THAN 500 YARDS BEHIND.

          166 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 166
          Close on ZORAN as he too turns for a last look at:

          THE WELL, NOW UP TO HALF A MILE BEHIND AND LOOKING LESS

          REAL IN THE SHIMMERING HEAT.

          167 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 167
          Close on VOSS, he shades his eyes to see:

          THE WELL IS BELOW THE HORIZON NOW, AND ALL THAT CAN BE

          SEEN IS THE ENDLESS FLATNESS, THE SAME EMPTINESS THAT

          STRETCHES OUT BEFORE THEM.

          168 EXT. GOBI, DESERT - TIMELAPSE - DAY 168 

          They walk in a desert void. There are no features, no
          distant hills, no growth of any kind. It is an
          emptiness, the only sound that of their footsteps and
          their labored breathing.

                         168 CONTINUED: 168
          All the while their water supply is dwindling - water
          from ZORAN's bowl long gone, the goat-skin water-bag no
          longer sloshes, but has to be squeezed to get out even a
          mouthful.

          169 EXT. GOBI - DUSK 169

          JANUSZ hands out small portions of the scavenged meat
          from the waterhole.
          All of them are subject to cramps, the result of the lack
          of water, and from time to time they are seen reacting to
          a sudden bolt of pain, attempting to stretch against it,
          or massage the limb out of its paralysis.

          170 LATER, SAME CAMPSITE - NIGHT 170 
          SMITH and JANUSZ collect more dried camel dung for the
          fire. SMITH looks to where the others sit.

                         SMITH
          We're in trouble.

                         JANUSZ
          I know that, but they mustn't.

                         SMITH
          They know.

                         JANUSZ
          You can survive a month or more
          without food, but water?

                         SMITH
          Days?

                         JANUSZ
          Maybe two days, maybe less in this
          heat.

                         SMITH
          What about what we're getting from
          condensation?

                         JANUSZ
          It's the only thing keeping us
          alive. But for how long?

                         SMITH
          Can you get us back to the
          waterhole?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          172 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 172 

          As they walk VOSS picks up a pebble, holds it up to show
          ZORAN who walks behind him.

                         VOSS
          When we worked the fields, during
          the hot summers, we used to suck
          on small stones like these. Don't
          know why but it made us feel less
          thirsty.
          ZORANpicks up a pebble.

                         ZORAN
          We've eaten just about everything
          else.

                         VOSS
          You don't eat it, just suck on it.
          At this moment IRENA falls again, her knees buckling and
          her face pitching into the sand in almost one movement.
          They turn her over again, wiping the sand from her nose
          and mouth. SMITH makes a shelter over her with their
          sticks and jackets. She lies with her eyes closed, her
          breathing coming in harsh gasps. Both legs are now
          swollen to the knees. He touches the swelling and the 
          marks his fingers make remain for some seconds.

                         VOSS (CONT'D)
          Sunstroke?
          IRENA wakes.

                         IRENA
          I'm becoming a nuisance.
          She looks down at her legs.

                         JANUSZ
          Do they hurt you?

                         IRENA
          No, not at all. They must be
          swelling because I've walked so
          far. Don't you think, Mister?
          SMITH nods reassuringly then quickly turns away, a look 
          of deep anguish passing across his face. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          173 EXT. GOBI - NIGHT 173

          The others keep watch over her as she sleeps. SMITH
          passes around a splash of water in the cup. They all
          refuse it.

                         ZORAN
          Save it for Irena. We've got our
          pebbles.
          And he pops one in his mouth, makes out it's delicious
          and soothing.
          In the now familiar ritual they scoop out holes in the
          sand, lining them with their jackets, hopeful of
          collecting a little moisture overnight.

          174 EXT. GOBI - DAWN 174

          They walk on, ZORAN carefully carrying the partly filled
          bowl of water. IRENA seems refreshed, but JANUSZ and
          SMITH walk beside her, watching her every step.

                         IRENA
          I can walk alright if I can lean a
          little on you.
          They each lightly lay a hand on her elbow.

          175 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 175 

          IRENA starts to fall forward, they steady her, and she
          walks on for a bit before slumping forward, and falling
          to her knees. SMITH too falls with exhaustion. VOSS
          hurries back to them.

                         JANUSZ
          Can you go on?

                         IRENA
          I think so. But what about Mr.
          Smith?
          SMITH struggling for breath is back on his feet, waving
          them on. VOSS and JANUSZ each put an arm about her and
          half-carrying, half-dragging her, they set off again but
          it's no use, she's lost all her strength.

                         VOSS
          I'm going to carry her.

                         (CONTINUED)

          178 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY 178

          A lizard, in close up, listens to an approaching sound.
          As the volume builds he runs for his life. A beetle too,
          has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a
          battered moccasin looms large in frame. We follow the
          foot a few staggering steps, then a blur, as a body falls
          through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath
          coming in short gasps.

          179 EXT. WIDER, GOBI DESERT - DAY 179 

          The five figures, small in frame, TOMASZ the last in
          line, down on his knees. He raises a hand, hasn't the
          strength to call out. Then one of the figures sees him,
          calls to the others.
          CLOSE on TOMASZ.
          He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the
          tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As
          JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers
          to his feet. JANUSZ steadies him, and taking his arm
          they continue.

          180 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 180

          As they walk the landscape changes from the endless
          scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the
          terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on
          the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the
          wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie
           singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive 
           dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up, 
           staring in horror - 

                          TOMASZ'S HALLUCINATION: 
           The dune is moving, rising up, higher and higher, like a 
           massive sand wave.
           Back on TOMASZ. He collapses, unconscious. 

          181 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - TWILIGHT 181 

           An eerie, ghostly twilight, the group all sitting 
           together in a rough circle around TOMASZ. He seems to 
          revive as he passes around sketches he's made during
          their imprisonment and escape.

                         181 CONTINUED: 181
          It's an almost cheerful scene, like a traveller showing
          happy snaps taken on holiday.

                         VOSS
          I like this one. When did you do
          that?
          He holds up a sketch of KAZIK, showing him examining one 
          of his battered shoes.

                         TOMASZ
          On the train. Poor Kazik, always 
          the trouble with his feet. 
          ZORAN holds up a drawing of himself.

                         ZORAN
          Who's this?

                         TOMASZ
          You.
          ZORAN looks at it again genuinely shocked.

                         ZORAN
          My father maybe, but is that
          how I look now?
          A chuckle from the others.
          SMITH stares at a sketch of IRENA.

                         SMITH
          You caught her smile. 
          SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back
          down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He
          knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn
          has given strength to his friends, and between them all
          is a feeling of love and a kind of peace.

          182 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - DAWN 182 

          They've tied his pencil to a length of hide, and hung it
          from the top of the cross over his grave. A faint breath
          of morning breeze sets it swinging like a pendulum, the
          others long gone.

          183 EXT. DUNES - DAY 183

          As they stagger on JANUSZ has moved well out in front,
          when he stumbles and falls. Then he sees it, just out
          ahead, and he begins crawling toward it.

          JANUSZ'S MIRAGE - DAY:
          It's the hedge and gate from his vision. Behind the
          hedge the hint of a roof. Through the gate can be seen
          the path to the front door.

          184 EXT. DUNES - DAY 184

          JANUSZ crawling faster now, when ZORAN appears beside
          him.

                         JANUSZ
          Do you see it?

                         ZORAN
          Come on, Jan.

                         JANUSZ
          But do you see it?

                         ZORAN
          No.
          He helps him to his feet and they continue on.

          185 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 185

          In the glare of the noon-day sun they shelter under
          their coats propped on their walking staffs. No-one
          speaks.

          186 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 186

          SMITH and JANUSZ support each other as they stagger on.
          SMITH's eyes are on the ground, following the dancing
          shadows before him. JANUSZ nudges him, points - above
          them two magnificent eagles, the source of the shadows.

                         JANUSZ
          Eagles live in mountains.
          SMITH looks at the featureless landscape ahead.

                         SMITH
          They also fly long distances.

          187 EXT. LANDSCAPE, MONGOLIA - DAY 187

          The dunes are more intermittent here, the ground more
          stony and undulating.

          VOSS hears it first, and with his remaining strength
          moves out of the circle of firelight into the desert. He
          pauses, listens again.
          A scraping sound. Then he sees them coming out of the
          gloom - JANUSZ dragging an unconscious SMITH by his
          shoulders. VOSS hurries to them. A look from JANUSZ -
          'water'? VOSS shakes his head, 'No'.

          190 EXT. CAMPSITE - SAME - DAWN 190

          A black snake, thick as your wrist, slides over ZORAN'S
          leg. He stares, too close to death to feel fear. He's
          not even entirely sure it's real. He watches its
          progress as it slithers up the rocky hillside. Then he
          gets it, and he's up, running on pure adrenaline,
          following after the snake, leaving his sleeping
          companions by the fire.

          191 EXT. HILLSIDE - BRIEF MONTAGE - DAY 191

          ZORAN tracking the snake. He mutters to himself in a
          kind of delirium. He is crawling after the snake,
          scraping skin from knees and elbows. The snake disappears
          down into a rocky defile, followed by ZORAN.

          192 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY 192

          SMITH in a death-like sleep. A distance away VOSS and
          JANUSZ stand, staring upward at the waving figure some
          fifty metres up the hill. A native? Black mud obscures
          his face. It's ZORAN. He waves, dances about, then in a
          cracked voice, a single word drifts down to them.

                         ZORAN
          Water!

          193 EXT. VALLEY FLOOR - DAY 193

          ZORAN, JANUSZ, VOSS - lie flat out like lizards, their
          faces in damp, black mud. Sucking sounds. They slurp at
          small pools of water, split lips, puffed and bleeding.
          At first, just to swallow is painful, but it is life.
          After each mouthful there is a moment they must wait as
          the seepage re-fills the little hollows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          194 EXT. MUD-POOLS - LATER - DAY 194

          They've carried SMITH to the water and JANUSZ supports
          him in a sitting position while VOSS and ZORAN, in turn,
          soak their shirts in the mud, dripping the life-giving
          liquid into SMITH'S mouth. He coughs, splutters, as he
          sucks at the moisture.

          195 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE VALLEY - DAY 195

          A black snake protruding about a foot out of a hole in
          the sandy soil. ZORAN points, and is joined by JANUSZ
          and VOSS. JANUSZ holds his hand up for them to go very
          still. He speaks in a whisper.

                         JANUSZ
          Knife .
          VOSS passes him the deer-bone knife. With it, he splits
          the end of his staff, to make a fork out of the end.

                         Z ORAN
          What if it's poisonous?

                         JANUSZ
          You can still eat it. Just cut
          off its head.
          He passes the knife to VOSS, then creeps toward the
          creature, and striking quickly he attempts to trap the
          snake in the fork. Too slow. The snake disappears into
          its hole.

          196 EXT. VALLEY - LATER - DAY 196

          Like snake-fishermen, they sit waiting bythe snake-hole
          - ZORAN too, has a snake-catching stick. Then they see a
          second snake, slithering across the rocks. At a signal
          they strike, ZORAN deftly trapping the snake's head in
          the cleft stick.

          197 EXT.CAMPSITE, VALLEY - DAY 197

          Chunksofwhitish snake meat are cooking on a thin flat
          stoneovera fire of twigs and grass. The men grab
          piecesofthe snake and eat, nodding approval.

                         JANUSZ
          It's not bad.

          JANUSZ helps SMITH sit up, feeding him a small piece of
          meat. SMITH waves him away, sinking back to the ground
          too tired to eat.

                         VOSS
          Kind of like chicken.

                         ZORAN
          Yeah, a long black poisonous
          chicken with no legs.

                         JANUSZ
          You know Valka talked of eating
          each other? In Siberia?

                         ZORAN
          He did? Would you have eaten me?

                         JANUSZ
          Probably.

                         ZORAN
          I would never have eaten you - too
          stringy and bitter, I'd rather eat
          snake.
          VOSS nearly chokes on something, reaches into his mouth,
          pulls out a tooth.

                         JANUSZ
          Scurvy.

          199 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 199

          The fire burns low, VOSS and ZORAN sleep. SMITH wakes
          from time to time and JANUSZ forces him to eat and drink.
          SMITH is deathly pale, his life ebbing away. He speaks
          in short, croaky stabs, every breath an effort.

                         SMITH
          It can kill you, remember?
          JANUSZ puzzled.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          'Kindness'.
          JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives
          him away.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          How long can you survive on snakes
          and mud? You should leave me, but
          you can't can you? You're a fool.
          I'd leave you.
          He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and
          suffering etched in sharp lines.

                         JANUSZ
          Mister?

                         SMITH
          What?

                         JANUSZ
          I mightn't know youur first name,
          but I know your son's name.
          SMITH stares at him.

                         SMITH
          Irena told you.
          JANUSZ nods.

                         JANUSZ
          Can I say his name?
          Nothing from SMITH.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          'David'.

                         SMITH
          Saying his name on't bring him
          back.
          He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ,
          an ironic smile on his lips.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You trying to give me the will to
          live? That it? Stop me giving
          up?

                         JANUSZ
          Are you giving up?

                         SMITH
          In the camps, some saw death as
          'freedom'.

          So why didn't you kill yourself?

                         SMITH
          Survival was a kind of protest.
          JANUSZ makes him take a little water.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          Now being alive is my punishment.

                         JANUSZ
          Punishment for what?

                         SMITH
          I brought David to Russia didn't

          I?

                         JANUSZ
          And no-one can forgive you? And
          you can't forgive yourself?

                         SMITH
          Be easier if I had religion, or a
          home to go back to, like you.

                         JANUSZ
          For us, the old life is gone.
          They sit in silence for a while.

                         SMITH
          Irena told me they tortured your
          wife and she informed on you.

                         JANUSZ
          Yes.

                         SMITH
          They did that to my boy.

                         JANUSZ

                         (NODS)
          My wife was released, that much I
          know. She lived, but like you she
          won't be able to forgive herself.
          Only I can do that.
          He leans closer to SMITH, speaks just above a whisper,
           his voice intense, his eyes burning.

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D)
           She'll torture herself for what
           she did. Just like you. That's
           why I have to get back!

          This last, has impressed SMITH, and despite his death-
          wish a flicker of life surges through his bones.

          200 EXT. CAMPSITE, MUD-FLAT - DAWN 200

          Next morning, and the figures of the four men are seen in
          wide-shot sleeping by the embers of their fire. One
          figure gets up, picks up his staff, and begins to walk
          slowly South, toward the distant mountains. It's SMITH.
          The others stir, their attention caught by the sight of
          SMITH staggering onward. JANUSZ knows what the effort to
          walk is costing him, and he knows this is SMITH's gift to
          him. They hurriedly pack up, VOSS cramming the back-pack
          with roasted snake-meat, ZORAN collecting a last bowl of
          water, which he pours carefully into their goatskin water-
          bag.

          201 EXT. DESERT - DAY 201

          JANUSZ catches up with SMITH, giving him his arm in
          support, and together they slowly continue their journey
          Southward.

          They leave the desert behind as they climb gently rising
          ground.

          203 RIVER, MONGOLIA - DAY 203
          The survivors each seen alone as they experience the life-
          giving water: one simply lets water run though his
          fingers; another submerges himself entirely; one drinks,
          savoring every mouthful as if it were the finest vintage
          wine. SMITH fishes. Beside him several of his catch
          gleam silver in the light.

                         204 - OMIT 

          205 EXT. HILLSIDE - DUSK/NIGHT 205

           Walking abreast they head toward a pass between two 
           massive mountains - in the distance gleaming snow-capped 
           peaks rise even higher.

          They sleep, huddled together amongst the stony rubble.
          It is snowing. VOSS is the first to rise. He looks
          about him in disbelief, shakes the others awake,
          pointing. Just beyond where they've slept a high wall
          towers above them. In this extreme Western section it's
          in poor shape - not built of stone, but of ancient mud
          bricks, tumbled down in many places, but to the East the
          outline is distinct as it straggles over ridges to the
          horizon - the Great Wall of China.

           They enter through a keyhole-like opening formed by

          The men climb steadily up snow-covered hills, pausing at

          CLOSE on the deeply lined face of a SHEPHERD. He wears
          Tibetan costume and squints his eyes as he stares into
          the distance.
          From his P.O.V., four distant figures walking across the
          snowy plain toward him. The sound of dogs barking.

          211 EXT. A RIDGE NEAR THE SHEPHERD'S HUT - DUSK 211

          Far below in a valley lies the legendary Lhasa - the
          stepped palace and surrounding town burnished by the last
          of the golden light. A sprinkling of lights come on as
          the shadows lengthen.

          stretching out before the four fugitives andtheirtour-

          Three horses arrive at the door of the lonely hut and its
          associated outbuildings. THE SHEPHERD dismounts and with
          much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who
          follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They
          stoop as they enter - a glimpse inside to where the four
          survivors sit at a table, surrounded by bowls and plates
           of food. 

          213 INT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 213

          The LAMA and the OFFICIAL sit opposite the group. Tea is
          served. The official speaks English with difficulty, and
          as in Mongolia, he addresses the elder of the group - MR.

          SMITH.

                         OFFICIAL
          India? Yes. There is the track
          to Sikkim, over the mountains.
          Many people go there.

                         SMITH
          And food?

                         OFFICIAL
          Small villages there. They give
          food. Wood for fire. Yes, but
          you don't go now.
          CLOSE on JANUSZ, intensely following the conversation.

                         JANUSZ
          Why can't we go now?

                         OFFICIAL
          If big snow come - very difficult.
          You wait here until Spring. This
          family keep you.
          He confers with the LAMA.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO SMITH)
          That's three months.

                         OFFICIAL
          (indicates the LAMA)
          He go to Lhasa. Get permission
          for to stay. Only to Spring. Not
          possible foreigners stay Tibet.
          SMITH bows his head, mutters thanks, all of the group
          doing likewise.

          214 INT. STABLES, SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 214

          THE SHEPHERD has seen JANUSZ, ZORAN and VOSS to their
          quarters. He passes VOSS a battered oil-lamp and retires
          with much bowing. They settle on the straw covered
          floor, laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets
          given to them by the shepherd's wife.

                         ZORAN
          Well, we can't cross in Winter.

                         JANUSZ
          He said it was 'difficult'.
          SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped
          space.

                         ZORAN
          I'm going to sleep 'till Spring.
          Like a bear in a cave. What about
          you, Mister?
          SMITH settles with his back to the wall, draws up his
          sheepskin.

                         SMITH
          I'm going to Lhasa.
          The others are stunned by this.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          The Lama has a contact - maybe get
          me out through China. There's a
          U.S. military mission there.
          They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them,
          breaking up the team.

                         ZORAN
          'Looking after number one.' Isn't
          that what Americans say?

                         SMITH
          Zoran?
          ZORAN eventually looks at him.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We escaped. We made it.
          VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small
          window.

                         ZORAN
          He's right. I just realized it.

                         VOSS
          Realized what?

                         ZORAN
          Apart from a few mountains, we're
          there. We made it.

                         VOSS
          Not all of us.

                         ZORAN
          No. Not all of us.
          Their thoughts drift back to their lost companions.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          What will you do, Mister? When
          you get home.

                         SMITH
          'Home'?

                         Z ORAN
          Build metros?

                         SMITH
          Might drift for a while.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         (LAUGHS)
          Haven't you had enough of that?
          CLOSE on JANUSZ, hardly listening, his thoughts
          elsewhere. Their late-night conversation drifts over
          him.

                         VOSS
          I will fight. First Germans, then
          Russians.

                         ZORAN
          Then re-build your church?

                         VOSS
          I will die fighting.
          This statement has an oddly prophetic sound. JANUSZ look
          across at him.

                         ZORAN
          I'm going to get Tomasz's pictures
          to a newspaper, or get them
          published somehow. Then I'm going
          to cook his chicken - but with
          extra salt just to annoy him.
          Chuckles from the group. 

                         SMITH
          And you, Janusz? 

          VOSS (TO SMITH) 
          As long as the Communists are in 
          Poland, he can't go back. 

                         ZORAN 
          They'd shoot you wouldn't they, 
          Janusz? 
          They settle down to sleep, outside the wind is picking 
          up. 

                         JANUSZ 
          I'll just keep on going. Until
          it's over. Keep on walking.
          SMITH looks through the gloom to where JANUSZ sits -
          moonlight slashes the side of his face, but he can't
          quite see his eyes.
          CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake. No thought of sleep.

                         215 - OMIT 

          216 INT. STABLES - DAWN 216

          ZORAN and VOSS agitated at the discovery that JANUSZ has
          gone. Much coming and going in and out of the hut,
          checking that he isn't somewhere close by. Only SMITH
          remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the
          wall, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He expected
          nothing less. 

          217 EXT. HIMALAYAS - DAY 217

          Up ahead a figure, JANUSZ, dwarfed by the mountain chain,
          struggles on, climbing toward the snow-capped passes.

          218 EXT. HIGHER PASS DAY 218

          As he climbs he hears a cry, mingling with that of the
          wind - a voice echoing about the mountains. He ignores
          it for a few paces, before he looks back - far below two
          figures waving and calling - VOSS and ZORAN.

          219 EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE/VALLEY, TIBET/INDIA - DAWN 219

          The change from the barren mountains of Tibet, to the
          lush green of Sikkim is abrupt and startling - from rocky
          upper reaches the slope to the valley becomes rich in
          scrubby birch-woods, rhododendrons, and deciduous forest,
          until finally it becomes dense rain forest. It is with a
          backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look
          up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking
          bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost
          of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on
          their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They
          walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive.
          Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a
          POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while
          some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting
          into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their
          grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks?

          220 EXT. VALLEY PATH, INDIA - DAY 220

          Close on JANUSZ, VOSS, and ZORAN as the beaming POLICEMAN
          escorts them past dozens of smiling faces.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         220 CONTINUED: 220
          This being India, a small crowd of the curious rapidly
          swells, until the path is lined two and three deep on
          either side, like a welcoming crowd at the end of a
          marathon. Small children are held up for a better look,
          while hands reach out patting their backs and shoulders -
          it's as if they know these men have achieved something
          remarkable.
          Close on JANUSZ, as amongst the sound of the gathering
          crowd other voices join in, cheering voices, hundreds of
          them, rising in volume until the cheering changes into
          that of a chant, now seemingly swelled by thousands of
          voices. Still CLOSE on JANUSZ walking as behind him the
          Indian scene dissolves into a series of black and white
          images. (Throughout, the image of JANUSZ walking is from
          this scene in India).

          The camera moves toward a gate in a hedge. The click of
          the latch as it opens. A downward view of the
          flagstones. The front door, the camera pans left. The
          loose brick. A hand into frame removes a key from behind
          the brick. Into the lock of the door, the door pushed
          open.

          222 INT. HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 222

          A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early
          seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the
          door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room
          appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG
          JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his
          wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his
           pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG
           JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to
          his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of
           suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's
           waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now
           as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see
          him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.
           Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her
          hand in his.

SUPER:  A TRUE STORY - MYSTIC HARBOR CONNECTICUT 1994

CREDITS OVER

Wind on the water.  Soaring gulls and sand pipers glide
over the pilings and sagging bulkheads.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Though I hadn't seen or spoken to
          Sheldrake in over thirty years, it
          seemed impossible that his heart was
          the thing that had finally failed
          him...


INT.  LATE MODEL CAR - SAME

CHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind
the wheel.  He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street
that leads to the wharf.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          I never got close to him, nobody
          did.  But by the time we made Tampa,
          I was sure I knew who he was, that I
          understood what he saw, what
          nourished his soul and tested his
          faith...


EXT.  WHARF - DAY

Chuck stares out across the harbor.  In the distance, the
echoes of singing masts.  Shrouds and canvas softly ping.
The small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their
moorings.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          He had taken us to worship, where,
          what was for him, the holiest of
          holies.  And, for us too by the
          end...


EXT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - LATER

Chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of
people.  They surround a small building, a neighborhood
clinic.  A worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates
the structure.

         IN MEMORY OF NATALIE "ALICE" SHELDRAKE M.D.,
          CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE
             BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961

Next to the stone a funeral urn.  A YOUNG MINISTER gropes
for meaning.

                         MINISTER
          I didn't know Richard Sheldrake
          personally, but his many friends who
          knew and worked with him, wanted to
          make sure that he was returned home,
          here, to be remembered with his
          beloved wife...

Chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice
fading away.  The afternoon wind is coming up with the
tide.  He quietly heads towards the water.  Drifting,
drawn, lost.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Though he had moved on with his
          life, now even for the years, to
          hear him eulogized by strangers,
          seemed strange.  He had been a
          hewner of stones, a pilot by the
          silent stars.  Like me, alone among
          many.  But most of all for us, the
          crew of the brigantine Albatross, he
          was always and would forever be...
          our Skipper.

A SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  A
beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips
into port.  A picture out of another time, another place.
It takes him away...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  FOREST - WATER TOWER - DAY

A towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and
sycamores.  The tower is immense.  A single ladder runs up
to the top.

AT THE TOP

Just above the tree tops, the view is spectacular.  CHUCK
GIEG, 16, sits thin and unsteady.  Chuck's gaze is drawn
upward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds.  Chuck's
older brother WILL, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself
to the top.

                         WILL
          You gonna jump?  Or are you just
          having a last look?

                         CHUCK
          I was just thinking that I never had
          a new pair of shoes till I was
          twelve.

                         WILL
          It's no my fault I was born first.
          Besides, nobody ever sent me on an
          eight month vacation, so ease up on
          the sad sack stuff.

                         CHUCK
          It's not a vacation, it's private
          school.

                         WILL
          I thought this was your dream come
          true.

                         CHUCK
          That's not why he's sending me.

                         WILL
          Why then.

                         CHUCK
          Because it looks good.

Chuck looks out, yearning.  Will considers him, troubled.

                         CHUCK
          I'm just not like you.  Ya know?
          I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm
          never going to be "William".

                         WILL
          Nobody says you have to be like me.

                         CHUCK
          He does.

                         WILL
          You don't give him enough credit
          Chas.

Chuck takes a last look at the building clouds.  The sky
rumbles.  Distant thunder.

                         WILL
          We better go.


EXT.  GIEG HOUSE - DAY

Maple street, USA, tree lined and quaint.  The Gieg home
is a modest two story house with a covered porch.  The
family station wagon is poised for departure.  CHARLES,
45, a generally serious man broods as MIDDY, their mother,
40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house.  Chuck and Will
appear from the woods.

                         CHARLES
                  (ticked)
          You plan on making this plane or
          not?

                         WILL
          Don't take any wooden nickels
          Kemosabe.

                         CHUCK
          I won't.

Will shoves out a hand at Chuck.

                         WILL
          And lighten up will ya.

Chuck hugs him anyway and walks to the passenger side.
Charles tosses him the keys, like he's doing him a big
favor.


INT.  CAR - DAY

Chuck sits in the drivers seat.  Middy is in the back.
Charles slams the trunk and gets in.  Before Chuck turns
the ignition...

                         CHARLES
          Now just take it easy.  We're not
          going to a fire.

Chuck reacts.

OUTSIDE

Will watches as the car pulls away.

CAR - MOVING

The Giegs drive in silence.  Middy reads from a brochure.

                         MIDDY
          Honey, did you know that the
          Albatross was captured by the
          Germans during World War II?

                         CHUCK
          No, I didn't.

                         MIDDY
          It says she was originally Schooner
          rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned
          her into a brigantine.  I think
          square rigs look so much more
          romantic.

                         CHUCK
          Me too.

                         CHARLES
          Appearances aren't everything.  Keep
          your mind on the road.

Chuck pulls over to the side of the road.

                         CHARLES
          What are you doing?

Chuck hands him the keys.

                         CHUCK
          I don't feel like driving.  Okay?

Charles regards him oddly.


EXT.  AIRPORT GATE - DAY

The National Airlines Boeing 707 is bigger than anything
Chuck has ever seen.  Passengers begin boarding.  Charles
stands away, detached.

                         MIDDY
          Do you have your ticket?

                         CHUCK
          Yes.

                         MIDDY
          Passport?

                         CHUCK
          Look, I just better go.

Middy hugs her son.

                         CHUCK
          Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.

                         MIDDY
          I know you will.

Chuck faces his dad.

                         CHARLES
          Make us proud.

                         CHUCK
          Yes sir.

Charles extends his hand.  They shake.  Then Chuck hurries
away into the crowd.  Charles and Middy watch until he is
out of sight.


INT.  PLANE - DAY

Chuck settles into his seat next to the window.  He
watches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the
707.


EXT.  AIRPORT CUSTOMS - BERMUDA - DAY

Another world.  Chuck stands in line at the customs booth.
He cranes his neck to see the brilliant blue water and
coral reefs beyond the runway.

Three other boys are ahead of him in line.  The CUSTOMS
AGENTS go through every piece of luggage.  TOD JOHNSTONE,
16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of
the agents about his spear gun.

RICK MARCH, 17, wise-cracking and confident, shakes his
head, smiling.  He spots Chuck, moves through the line and
shoves out a hand.

                         RICK
          Albatross?

                         CHUCK
          Yeah.

                         RICK
          Rick March.  Who the hell are you?

                         CHUCK
          Gieg, Chuck.

                         RICK
          Look, meet us out front when you're
          through.  If they try to take
          anything away from you like Johnny
          Quest up there, just make a list and
          we'll have 'em send it down to the
          boat.

                         CHUCK
          Whatever.

One of the agent starts pulling things out of Rick's
duffel bag.  He finds a dive knife.

                         RICK
          Hey, hey!!  That's my stuff!!


EXT.  AUSTIN CAB - MOVING - DAY

The car whizzes through the narrow streets of Bermuda.
CALYPSO MUSIC sings from the radio.  The streets are lined
with small coral houses and exotic palms.


INT.  CAR - SAME

The boys are jammed inside with their things.  In addition
to Chuck, Rick and Tod, is CHARLIE STRATTON, also sixteen.

                         TOD
          Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no,
          it's sweet to be back in the world
          of rum and honey.

                         RICK
          I gotta admit I never thought you'd
          be back after the great "Bowsprit
          Affair".

                         TOD
          Me and Skipper had a meeting of the
          minds.

                         CHARLIE
          How's that?

                         TOD
          I begged.

                         CHUCK
                  (warming a little)
          What the "Bowsprit Affair"?

                         RICK
          Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch
          and managed to sweet talk one of the
          local girls to have a go in the
          bowsprit.

                         TOD
          Not just any 'local' girl.

                         RICK
          The 'local' mayor's 'local'
          daughter.

Tod smiles, reminiscing.

                         CHARLIE
          Thing is, the net in the basket
          isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o
          wraps them up in the jib.  After the
          deed was done...

                         RICK
          He says they did the deed...

                         TOD
          Trust me, we did the deed.

                         CHARLIE
          After the "alleged" deed was done,
          they fell asleep.  Big Daddy Lawford
          comes on deck at four bells and
          hears Casanova sawing logs.

                         TOD
          Believe me, I needed the rest...

                         CHARLIE
          He gets the whole crew on deck, gets
          us on the halyard, and orders the
          old "heave ho...".

                         RICK
          Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o
          and the mayor's daughter, naked as
          pilot whales...

                         CHARLIE
                  (to Tod)
          I don't know who was more surprised,
          you or Big Daddy.

                         TOD
          To tell you the truth, I think it
          was her father.

At the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view.

                         RICK
          Well gentlemen, there she is.

The cab stops.  Besides many colorful fishing boats, is
the ALBATROSS.  At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything
in the harbor.  Her white hull glows like ivory and her
twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck.
Breathtaking.

                         CHARLIE
          Home sweet hell on the water.


EXT.  DOCK - DAY

The boys pile out of the taxi.  What seemed like a
pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up
close.  The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover
the hull.  Looks of disappointment.

                         CHUCK
          What happened to it?

A voice from behind turns Chuck.

                         BILL
          She cleans up.  We'll have her ship
          shape before we shove off.

This is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew
and... first mate.  Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on
the back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Viking
giant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's
English professor.

Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at
Tod and the others.  He speaks with the voice of Moses.

                         LAWFORD
          "That this same child of honor and
          renown, This gallant Hotspur, this
          all praised knight, And your
          unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
          For every honor sitting on his helm,
          Would they were multitudes, and on
          my head.  My shames redoubled!  For
          the time will come...

Chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the
intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins.
Their eyes lock.

                         LAWFORD
          ... That I shall make this northern
          youth exchange, his glorious deeds
          for my indignities."

Then, the man is gone.  Haunting.  Only Chuck has seen
him.  Tod smiles back at Lawford impishly.

                         TOD
          Would you be addressing me, sir?

                         LAWFORD
          I would.

                         RICK
          What's that supposed to mean?

                         LAWFORD
                  (beat)
          Henry the IV part I Act I Scene ii.
          I suggest you read it.

Lawford sneers and walks away.  It's all a show.

                         CHARLIE
          It means Shakespeare.  B-o-r-i-n-g.

                         BILL
          It means if he catches anybody
          basket-napping on watch this
          passage, he's gonna use their lizard
          for 'cuda' bait.

                         RICK
                  (lightly)
          Well that's a hell of a how-do-you-
          do.

                         BILL
          Drop your gear, go below and pick
          yourself some bunks.

Chuck and the others climb aboard.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY

Chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main
cabin.  Other crew members are already unpacking.

The sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of
bunks on each side of the cabin.  In the middle of the
room is a gimbaled table.  This is where the crew will eat
and study.

                         RICK
          Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg.

Among the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub
with soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and
rodent-like.

Robin approaches with a hand extended.  He carries a 8x10
photo of a young man in a football uniform.

                         ROBIN
          I'm Robin.

Chuck regards the photo.

                         ROBIN
                  (flat)
          That's my brother.  He's dead.

Apprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk.
Robin tacks up the picture above his bunk.  Terry unpacks
in front of one of the lower berths.

A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag lies
at the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposing
figure climbs into the cabin.

This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad.
His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full
day's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to the
others, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path.
He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk)
and drops his bag.

                         JOHN
          I'll take this one.

                         TERRY
          You probably didn't notice, but this
          bunk has been taken.

John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things
onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it
into the remaining upper berth.  Terry watches,
intimidated.

                         JOHN
          Anybody gotta problem with that?

                         RICK
                  (beat)
          Absolutely not.

John climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes.  Bill
enters, followed by several adults.

DR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is
ship's surgeon and Skipper's wife.  Lawford appears with
GEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit.

                         BILL
          Alright, listen up.  This is Dr.
          Alice Sheldrake.

The guys stumble over only half listening.

                         ALICE
          I'm ship's surgeon.  I'm in charge
          of aches, pains, biology, math and
          science.

                         BILL
          George Pascal here is ship's cook.

                         GEORGE
          If you want to keep all your
          fingers, stay the hell out of my
          galley unless you're invited.

                         BILL
          Some of you already know Mr.
          Lawford.

                         LAWFORD
          I have been charged with the dubious
          task of insuring your literary
          education.

Lawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder.

                         LAWFORD
          Bill Butler is your first mate.  But
          don't let his size fool you.

Bill gives a half reluctant wave.

                         MIKE
          So when the hell do we get to meet
          El Capitan?

Snickering.

                         TERRY
                  (aside)
          Maybe he's getting his wooden leg
          waxed.

Laughter.  A sound stops the laughter.  Almost on cue, the
sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above
them.  Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking
the light.  Ominous.  They all notice and look up.

                         LAWFORD
                  (mysterious)
          You'll meet him.  Soon enough.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE

Dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin.  The
only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber.
Suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.

                         LAWFORD (O.S.)
          Arise, Arise, Arise...

Chuck wakes, disoriented.  Terry bolts upright and hits
his head on the low ceiling.  Ouch.

Tod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly.  Lawford's voice
echoes through the ship.

                         LAWFORD (O.S.)
          Exultation is the going/ Of an
          inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/
          Past the headlands/ Into deep
          Eternity/ Bred as we, among the
          mountains/ Can the sailor
          understand/ the divine intoxication/
          of the first league out from land?
                  (pause)
          But I suppose we'll answer that
          question soon enough gentlemen.
          Soon enough.

                         TERRY
          What question?

Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.  Robin swings
his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look.
John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.

                         ROBIN
                  (foggy)
          What the hell is going on?

                         CHUCK
          Maybe it's an air raid.

In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps
through the aft bulkhead.  He raises a bowswain's  whistle
and blows.  OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!  Chuck and Robin grab their
ears.  It's a nightmare.  Terry jumps and hits his head
again.

                         BILL
          Roll out sailors!  All hands on
          deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty
          seconds.

He blows the whistle again.  This time it brings even John
to his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.  Bill
looks up and casually notices him.

                         BILL
          You gotta problem Goodall?

                         JOHN
          You blow that thing again I'll shove
          it so far up your ass, you're gonna
          need dental floss to get it out.

                         BILL
          Just get on deck.

Bill turns and disappears topside.


EXT.  DECK - DAWN

The sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew
staggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering.

                         BILL
          Line up!  Single file.  Single file.

The crew lines up.  John is the last one through the hatch
and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed.

                         BILL
          Everybody swims.

The boys are aghast.

                         LAWFORD
          Don't think people, just go!  Go,
          Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win,
          stay you pay!!

Rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by
Tod and Charlie.  They howl and scream as they hit the
water.  The rest follow like lemmings.  But John stands
defiantly with his arms folded.

                         BILL
          Now what's the problem, Goodall?
          Everybody swims.

The crew are piling back on deck.  George stands in the
open galley door.  The smell of fresh bacon is
intoxicating.

                         JOHN
          I don't.

                         LAWFORD
          You will if you wanna eat.  Right
          George?

George nods, wielding a butchers knife.  The crew stand
shivering, waiting on John.

                         JOHN
                  (to Bill)
          You gonna swim for your breakfast?

Bill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts,
swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard
arm.  He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet
below.  It's a long way.  Robin turns away.

Lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.

                         LAWFORD
          "Down, down beneath the deep, That
          oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a
          sound and peaceful sleep, With the
          salt waves dashing over him." --
          Lord Byron gentlemen.

With that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge
KERSPLASH!  He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself
up and gets in John's face.

                         BILL
          Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in
          twice.  So I guess I'll be eating
          your breakfast too.

John considers him, then strips off his shirt.  But
instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into
the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down.

He manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of
ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard
arm -- the topgallant.  It's a pissing contest and
everybody knows it.

                         MIKE
          I got five bucks says he doesn't.

                         CHRIS
          I got five that says he doesn't
          live.

                         TOD
          I'll take a dollar of that.

                         ROBIN
          This is crazy!

Robin refuses to watch.  The others share a look.

John makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the
end of the yard.  He tosses a look towards Bill but with
no way to back down, he launches into the air.  Everyone
gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive.
Falling, falling, falling...

                         CHUCK
          Jesus.

                         ROBIN
          I can't watch this.

John hits the water like a bullet.  The crew run to the
side waiting for him to come up.  Nothing.  Finally, he
breaks the surface.  Easy.  He climbs up waiting, somehow,
to claim victory.

Suddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appeared
silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing
down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to
see him.

RICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept,
casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and
glides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzed
from the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of command
like a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be
reckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence of
someone larger than life.

                         BILL
          Skipper on deck!

The crew line up clumsily.  Skipper has a gaze that blazes
right through them.

He looks out to sea.  Searching, ominous.  He waits until
the silence is filled with everyone's attention.

                         SKIPPER
          You know what's out there?  Wind and
          wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools
          that'll hold a sailing ship for
          weeks and then spit her out into the
          eye of the kind of hurricane.  A
          blow that could knock the bridge off
          a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and
          sandbars that'll tear the belly from
          her and enough fog and night to hide
          it all.

He spits into the water.  The crew sheepishly throw
glances to the horizon.

                         SKIPPER
          So look out there... and explain to
          me why any man in possession of any
          sense at all, would take on the sea
          with sail?

Skipper turns his gaze back to the boys.  There is a fire
in his eyes.  Nobody dare answers.

                         SKIPPER
          Because there's something else out
          there.  It beckons in the wind and
          sings in the shrouds.  Voices.
          Whispering...

His ear to the wind.

                         SKIPPER
          They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men
          you don't even know.  Men you can't
          even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish,
          that part of you and I that aches to
          be alive, that was banished by
          everything we've ever been taught or
          told.  It's a part of us that can
          only be found on mountain tops and
          deserts, in the deepest caverns,
          smoking battle fields and... across
          oceans.

He turns back to the sea, dark.

                         SKIPPER
          Out there, is where it all waits.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          He was everything I had expected,
          part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh.
          He spoke in whispers and answered
          all queries with efficiency and
          directness.  He had gone to sea for
          the first time at fifteen, the same
          age as Bill Butler.  And as he
          looked upon us that first day it
          must have been as though he were
          staring into a mirror.

Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the
chart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded to
the main mast and reads the inscription.

                         SKIPPER
                  (reading)
          "Where we go one, we go all."

With that, he disappears below.  Nobody moves.  This is
exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits
the fan.

                         TERRY
          This -- is gonna be a long eight
          months.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY

The boys devour a hearty breakfast.  Tod is the 'galley
slave' and fills glasses with orange juice.

                         TOD
          Chow down boys.  The milk and eggs
          are the first things to go once we
          put out.

John enters balancing two plates heaped with food.

                         RICK
          You know we gotta dumbwaiter for
          that.

John looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall.

                         RICK
          Not that one.  Tod-o here.

The guys groan.

                         TOD
          Har, har, har...

John approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry who
doesn't notice him.  Finally he looks up, startled.

                         TERRY
          I'm done.  I'm finished...

He scrambles to get up and clear his plate.  John sits
down without a word.  The others notice the two plates of
food.

                         RICK
          Hungry, Goodall?

He just grunts and starts eating.  Robin watches him.

                         JOHN
          What's your problem?

                         ROBIN
          Why'd you jump?

                         JOHN
          Because I felt like it.
                  (sharp)
          What do you care?

                         ROBIN
                  (aside)
          I couldn't do it.

                         JOHN
          Well, as soon as you grow some
          balls, let me know.

Robin bristles.

                         ROBIN
          Screw you!

                         CHARLIE
          He's right.  It was a stupid stunt.

                         JOHN
          Excuse me?

                         CHARLIE
          You heard me.

John grabs Charlie by his private parts and hoists him
into the air.  Charlie gasps, the air sucked from his
lungs.

                         JOHN
          Don't ever call me stupid.

                         ROBIN
          Come on, he didn't mean anything.

John shoves Robin to the floor with his free arm.

                         JOHN
          Let me tell you girls something.  I
          do what I wanna do.  When I wanna do
          it.  And I don't give a shit what
          old Ahab up there thinks either.
          Any questions?

John releases Charlie who crumples to the floor.  John
resumes eating.

Bill enters and reads the duty roster.

                         BILL
          Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg,
          Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart:
          scrape and paint.  Corry and
          Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson,
          you're the Galley slave.  March
          you're on chain gang with Barnes.
          Johnston, solo on bilge detail.

                         TOD
          Butler, what'd I ever do to you?

                         BILL
          You came back, Tod.  You came back.

John continues to eat.  When he realizes his name hasn't
been called, he looks up to meet Bill's eyes.


INT.  HEAD

Pissed, John tries to figure out the head.  Pumps going
in, pumps going out.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          We were all thirteen individuals.
          We'd arrived the sum total of our
          limited experiences and the result
          of our parents' best, if not narrow,
          expectations...

John pulls back on the lever, belching "water de le
toilet" all over him.


EXT.  SHIP - DAY

Chuck sits in a bowswain's chair over the side, with a
paint roller in his hand.  The rust-streaked hull is being
transformed.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          ... Some of us were there for
          discipline, some for escape.  But I
          could see a small piece of myself in
          all of them and though I fought the
          notion, for me, I knew now, this
          would be home.

A RADIO crackles in the b.g.

                         ANNOUNCER
          "President Eisenhower today
          acknowledged that a secret American
          spy plane was in fact shot down over
          the Soviet Union.  The pilot has
          been confirmed as Francis Gary
          Powers..."

Robin, Terry and Mike, are on the deck within earshot of
Chuck with chisels and wire brushes chipping away at the
rust.

                         TERRY
          Why couldn't it have been a wooden
          boat?

                         MIKE
          Steel boats don't leak.

Mike lights up a cigarette.  Robin notices.  Marlboro's.

                         ROBIN
          Hey, can I have one?

Mike sizes up Robin for a moment then tosses him the pack.

                         ROBIN
          Thanks daddy-o.

Robin lights up, grimacing with the first drag.

                         TERRY
          Well, don't brush too hard.  Looks
          to me like the only thing holding
          this bucket together is the rust.

A voice booms up from the dock.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Ahoy there.

They turn.  Standing on the dock is FRANCIS BOUTILLIER,
self important and overbearing, with his son, PHILIP, who
looks as if this whole ordeal is some kind of punishment.
Skipper appears.

                         SKIPPER
          Good afternoon.

Francis boards without being invited.  Philip follows in
his shadow.  He scrutinizes the condition of the boat.

                         FRANCIS
          Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of
          confidence.

                         SKIPPER
          Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross
          is considered a very good omen.  It
          is said they embody the spirits of
          sailors passed on.  It's very bad
          luck if you kill one.  And dolphins
          too.

The boys chuckle.

                         FRANCIS
          I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my
          son, Philip.

                         SKIPPER
          I know.

Francis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling.

                         SKIPPER
          You're a day late.  We keep a
          schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend
          on it.
                  (to Philip)
          Hello, Philip.

                         PHIL
          Sir.

Skipper's directness bugs Francis.

                         FRANCIS
          Your cable said you wouldn't be
          putting out until mid-October.

                         SKIPPER
          As you can see, there's a lot to do.

                         FRANCIS
          Indentured servitude is not what my
          son had in mind.

                         SKIPPER
          This is a working ship.  Promptness
          is not a luxury, it's a necessity,
          as is the work to maintain her.  Had
          we been ready, I can assure you we
          would have sailed.

Something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation.

                         FRANCIS
          And I would have expected
          compensation for my time and expense
          coming all the way down here.

                         SKIPPER
          Happily, it all worked out... This
          time.
                  (to Bill)
          Bill, take Philip below and help him
          find a bunk.

Phil follows Bill down the companionway.

                         FRANCIS
          I'll be frank with you.  This was
          his mother's idea.  A romp through
          the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds
          more like a vacation than an
          education if you ask me.

                         SKIPPER
          It will be more than that, I can
          promise you.

                         FRANCIS
                  (cool)
          Take good care of my son.

There is threat in his tone.

                         SKIPPER
          We'll do our best.  You're welcome
          to say goodbye.

                         FRANCIS
          He's a big boy.

Francis leaves the boat.  Skipper and the crew watch as he
climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off.

                         LAWFORD
          Well, that was neighborly.

                         SKIPPER
          He didn't get to be Under Secretary
          of the Air Force by being
          neighborly.

Lawford shakes his head.  Bill comes up through the
companionway.

                         SKIPPER
          Everyone aboard young Bill?

                         BILL
          Yes, Sir.

                         SKIPPER
          Good.
                  (beat)
          Let's go sailing.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - OPEN WATER - DAY

The Albatross is under full power.  There is a sense of
excitement and anticipation.  Charlie, Rick, Robin, and
Lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail.  Skipper is
at the helm with Alice and Bill nearby.  Skipper calls
over to Chuck who stands alone at the rail.

                         SKIPPER
          Come over here and take the wheel.

Chuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the
wheel.

                         SKIPPER
          Hold her steady into the wind.
          Southwest by west.

                         CHUCK
          Yes sir.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to all)
          Gentleman, when you hear an order,
          sing out.  I want to know that
          you've heard and understand.
                  (quietly to Bill)
          Raise the mainsail.

                         BILL
                  (calling out)
          Raise the main!

Lawford and his group bellow out.

                         TOGETHER
          Raise the main!!

Lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the
chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy
furled canvas to the main boom.  He guides another to the
midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the
huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens the
halyard and hands it to Robin.

                         SKIPPER
          Take a turn under the pin and lead
          it out to the others.  You guys in
          the rear take up the slack.  Heave
          together now...

In a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea
chanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt.

                         BILL
                  (singing)
          "When the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup..."

The more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the
beat.

                         BOYS
          "When the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup..."

                         LAWFORD
          Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt
          it out like men!!

The newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look at
each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever
heard of.

                         BILL
                  (singing)
          "Not one of us was a sober..."

The boys return the verse half heartedly.  Lawford ties
off his line and stares them down.  Skipper notices that
the work has stopped.

                         SKIPPER
          What's wrong Mr. Lawford.

                         LAWFORD
          It seems we're short on singers.

Skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.

                         SKIPPER
          Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer
          gentlemen.  It lets everyone know
          you're in sync.  It shows unity,
          that all thoughts are one.  A crew
          that sings together stays together.
          Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and
          be sailors.

                         JOHN
                  (in a whisper)
          Everybody swims, everybody sings...
          What's next?  Tap dancing?

Lawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down
with their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  The
crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great
mainsail starts to rise.

                         LAWFORD
          Tie it off!!

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Bill)
          Outer.

                         BILL
          Outer Jib!

                         CHARLIE
                  (confused)
          Outta what?

Coached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist
the jib.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Bill)
          We'll bear off to port and run down
          wind.

                         BILL
          Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the
          mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib
          sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim
          and Dick go aloft to unstop the
          forecourse.  George will show you
          what to do.  Tod, show your men the
          forward pinrail and stand ready on
          the buntlines and clewlines.
          Forecourse first... work upward.

The newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George,
John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto
the footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusion
everywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing.

Lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the
others move into their positions.  When Bill sees the
yardarm crew is in place...

                         BILL
          Unstop the squares!

                         YARDARM CREW
          Unstop the squares!!

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Chuck)
          Fall off to port.  Ease her around
          to a heading of northeast.  Sing out
          when you're there.

As the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into
a scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind the
snapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, the
ship heels and surges forward.

Before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance
and grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out the
mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines
releasing the stops on the other squaresails.

                         CHUCK
                  (in a whisper)
          Ah... Northeast... sir.

                         SKIPPER
                  (barking)
          Speak up boy!

Chuck jumps, startled.  He self-consciously calls out.

                         CHUCK
          Northeast sir!

                         SKIPPER
          Unfurl the squares!

Tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and
the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending
a shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles with
the added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice and
Lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's
position.

Chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty
of the canvas that the Albatross carries.

                         BILL
          Raise the inner jib!  Raise the
          forestaysail!

                         SKIPPER
          Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we
          jibe now we'll have a lot of people
          in the water.

                         CHUCK
          Yes, sir.

                         SKIPPER
          All stop on the engine.

                         BILL
          All stop on the engine!

Bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves
it to the stop position.

                         SKIPPER
          Behold gentlemen.  The power of the
          wind!

As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed.
Everyone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a
powerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam
splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through
the water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a
magical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer.

                         SKIPPER
          Did we lose anybody?

                         ALICE
          Not yet.

LONG SHOT

The Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful
image of another time.  And yet, here she is.

ON DECK

Each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment.
Music builds.

                         SKIPPER
          Chart us a course for the windward
          side.

Alice considers his request.

                         ALICE
          That low passed through last night.
          May be a little bumpy out there.

                         SKIPPER
          It's time these boys saw some real
          blue water.


EXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER

The bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a
fifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is
fierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and
sailing well.

The crew has never seen mountains of water like this.
Disaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front
of the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear
life.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands
effortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains
perfectly dry.

                         SKIPPER
          Well... now that I have your
          undivided attention... I'd like to
          take this opportunity to make a few
          points...

                         TERRY
                  (aside)
          This guy is certifiable...

                         PHIL
          Suicidal...

                         SKIPPER
          The first thing is I don't like
          people talking when I'm talking so
          the two of you, shut up.

Caught, Terry and Phil button up.

                         SKIPPER
          Second, the next one of you who
          doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr.
          Butler gives an order is gonna spend
          the rest of this trip scrubbing
          bilges.  He's a better sailor today
          than any ten of you will be when
          this is all over.

Skipper directs the next comment directly at John.

                         SKIPPER
          And if I catch anybody, ever,
          jumping off a yard arm again I will
          personally break what bones are left
          and send you home in a wheel chair.

A wave explodes over the bow.  A wall of water crashes
over the deck knocking down several of the boys.  Terry
can't take it anymore and explodes.

                         TERRY
          We're gonna die!!!  We're all gonna
          die!

He lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him.

                         SKIPPER
          Excellent point.  As you might have
          noticed, being out here pretty much
          puts you in the moment.  If you
          panic, if you lose your head, you
          die.  Maybe you take your mates with
          you.  How'd you like to have to bet
          on Terry here getting us home today?
          Each one of you is responsible for
          the rest.  "Where we go one, we go
          all".  If your buddy is asleep at
          the switch we're all fish food.

He's making his point which is lost on no one.

                         SKIPPER
          The ship beneath you is not a toy
          and sailing is not a game.  The
          Albatross will take us far
          gentlemen, but she demands constant
          attention.  Respect her, and we'll
          do fine.  Oh, and one more thing.
          There is nothing that goes on, on
          this boat that I don't know about.
          She speaks to me in the night.  So
          don't test me.  Not even a little.

Skipper walks over and puts an arm around Terry who is
fighting sobs.

                         SKIPPER
          Nothing like experience to put
          things in perspective.  Huh son?
                  (to Bill)
          Alright.  Let's go home.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - DAY

Lawford addresses some of the crew.  Chuck, Robin and John
are among them.  John glares at Lawford.  The guys giggle.

                         LAWFORD
          That's not a satisfactory answer.

                         JOHN
          Look, save it for somebody else will
          ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have
          anything to do with me.

Lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes
theatrically.

                         LAWFORD
          Shit?!!!

He slams a text book into John's hands.

                         LAWFORD
          Read for me please the words of Mr.
          Keats at the bottom of the page.

John stares back, simmering.  Robin interrupts the
potential confrontation and reaches for the book.

                         ROBIN
          I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.

                         JOHN
          Shut up donut.

John pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for a
moment.  He begins reading but struggles with the cadence.

                         JOHN
                  (reading)
          Much have I traveled in realms of
          gold/ And many goodly states and
          kingdoms seen/ Round many western
          islands have I been/ Which bards in
          fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one
          wide expanse had I been told/ That
          deep-browed Homer ruled as his
          demesne.

                         LAWFORD
          You know what he is talking about
          here?

Blank faces.

                         LAWFORD
                  (ranting)
          Awe.  Humility.  He's telling you
          that he has traveled the seas as
          Homer did.  As Ulysses had before
          him as he tried to find his way home
          to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars.
          "That deep browed Homer"...

He points to his head.

                         LAWFORD
          Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the
          mind; "... ruled as his demesne."
          He commands the voyage of the
          imagination, like a god.
                  (pause)
          That is what one of the greatest
          literary minds of modern times, Mr.
          Boutillier, has to say about Homer.

He snatches the book back.

                         LAWFORD
          You think the Odyssey is dull?  I'll
          tell you something, it's about each
          one of you -- right now.  Doubt and
          expectation.  Friendship, community,
          self sacrifice and accountability.

He holds up the text.

                         LAWFORD
          This isn't just a story!!  It's
          history made allegory.  It is a
          philosophical handbook for life!  It
          holds the secret of this very
          voyage.

                         JOHN
          What is it... the secret?

Lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh.

                         JOHN
                  (confused)
          What?

                         LAWFORD
          If it were only that simple, my
          young friend.  Read on, gentlemen.
          Read on.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Aerial shot.  The Albatross is under full sail leaving
Bermuda for the last time.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          And so it was the Albatross that
          took to the open sea with the wind
          in her snapping canvas and a bone of
          white foam in her teeth... In each
          of us were feelings of anticipation
          and hesitation for the man at the
          wheel and of the unfamiliar world he
          was leading us into.

She crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music,
building.

DECK - DAY

The crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail.  Chuck
struggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in.

ALOFT

The crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the
rigging.

BOWSPRIT NET

The crew pull down the jib trying to furl it.  Most of the
sail ends up dragging in the water.

ABOVE

The squaresails are dropped simultaneously.

WIDE

White foam boils from the bow of the Albatross as she
crashes through the waves.

AT THE WHEEL

Alice smiles and puts her arms around Skipper's waist.
It's coming together.

FORETOP - SAME

Skipper stands at the rail, looking out.  The seas are up
and the masts are pitching widely from side to side.

Chuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestling
with one of the squaresails.  The pitching mast catches
him by surprise and he slips.  He tumbles down, tangled in
the lines.  A rope wraps around his neck, choking him.
Robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly.

                         ROBIN
          Bill!!  Skipper!!

Robin freezes.  Skipper leaps into the rigging like a
spider and, in a few seconds, wrestles Chuck free and
carries him down to the deck.  Chuck coughs, catching his
breath.  The color is gone from Skipper's face.  This was
a close call.

                         SKIPPER
          You all right?

                         CHUCK
          It was my fault.  I slipped.

Alice examines Chuck, making sure he's okay.  Skipper
turns to Robin, who is shaken.  He never raises his voice.

                         SKIPPER
          Why didn't you go up there?

Robin stands silently.

                         SKIPPER
          Speak up.

Still nothing from Robin.

                         CHARLIE
          He's afraid to climb.

                         SKIPPER
          What?
                  (to Robin)
          Is that true?

Robin looks away.

                         SKIPPER
          Why wasn't I made aware of this
          Bill?

                         BILL
          I didn't know sir.

                         SKIPPER
          It's your job to know.  If something
          goes wrong up there, the other
          eighteen people aboard can't be
          wondering if he's gonna do his job
          or not.

Skipper returns his gaze to Robin, measuring him.
Finally.

                         SKIPPER
          Swing up, son.

                         ROBIN
                  (trembling)
          What?

                         SKIPPER
          Up you go.  Right now.

Robin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung,
then the second.  He stops and steals a peek up.  The mast
is swaying.  He freezes, his lip starts to tremble.  All
eyes are on him.  Phil chuckles.

                         SKIPPER
          Do you have something to say?

                         PHIL
                  (smug)
          No.

                         SKIPPER
          Then keep your mouth shut.

Phil backs off, stunned.  Robin can't move.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Robin)
          What's it going to be?

                         ROBIN
          I'm sorry...

                         SKIPPER
          Sorry won't cut it.

Robin holds on frozen.  Skipper turns to the crew.

                         SKIPPER
          Survival means discipline and
          assimilation.  There are no special
          cases here.
                  (to Robin)
          Now, get going.  Get up there.

Humiliated, a tear slips down his face.  Excruciating.

                         SKIPPER
          What are you blubbering about?

                         ROBIN
          I don't know...

Skipper jumps onto the backside of the ratlines.  His face
is but inches from Robin's.

                         SKIPPER
          One hand in front of the other son.
          We'll do it together.

Robin reaches for the next rung.  He looks down.  Skipper
growls at him.

                         SKIPPER
          Don't look down.  Look in my eyes!
          Climb!  We'll do it together.

                         ROBIN
                  (sobbing)
          I can't.

                         SKIPPER
          You climb damn it, or so help me
          I'll haul you to the foretop by your
          diaper and leave you there!

                         ROBIN
          Aaauuuhhh!!!

Skipper gets right in his face and snarls.

                         SKIPPER
          Are you hating this?!  Are you!

                         ROBIN
          I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!

                         SKIPPER
          No.  Hate the fear inside of you!
          Climb like a man mister!  Hate it!
          Hate it away.  Hate your way up one
          more rung!!  Do it right now!!

With every ounce of strength, Robin reaches for one more
rung screaming as he reaches.  Skipper climbs and screams
with him.

                         TOGETHER
          Auuuggghhh!!!!

Robin clutches the rung with a death grip.  Then, he looks
down.  His bladder releases.  Hot urine runs down his legs
and splashes, steaming, onto the deck.  The crew is
horrified.  Robin weeps.

                         ROBIN
          Oh, god...

Skipper backs off.

                         SKIPPER
          Don't hate yourself.  Hate your
          weakness.  All right.  Get down.

Robin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others,
mortified.

                         SKIPPER
          I'm only gonna say this one time.
          I'm not here to wipe noses and
          asses.  I'm not your mother.  Trust
          funds and blue blazers don't get you
          a thing out here.  You wanna act
          like babies, then get off my boat.

Stunned, the crew is speechless.  Chuck instinctively goes
to help Robin.  Skipper snaps like a turtle.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Chuck)
          He can take care of himself.
                  (to others)
          Any other 'phobias' I need to know
          about?

Skipper fires a look towards Phil.

                         PHIL
          No, sir.

                         SKIPPER
          Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers
          a position to suit his condition.

Skipper turns and then stops.

                         SKIPPER
          Remember something, sooner or
          later... we all have to face it.

                         CHUCK
                  (aside)
          Face what?

The question hangs in the air like a cloud.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - DUSK

The chart house is the communication and navigation center
for the boat.  It also serves as the officers dining room.
Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sit
around the small table sipping coffee.

                         SKIPPER
          We're awfully quiet tonight.

The group remains silent.  Lawford and George exchange a
glance.  Skipper catches it.

                         SKIPPER
          Something on your mind, George?

George looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin.

                         GEORGE
          I think you were too hard on
          Weathers.

                         SKIPPER
          You do?

                         GEORGE
          Yes.  I do.

Skipper nods.

                         SKIPPER
          I need to know what I'm working
          with; what their boundaries are.
          Their lives depend on it, and for
          that matter so does yours.  We've
          got to bring them together.  Make
          them a crew.  We're as strong as our
          weakest link and I don't want to
          find that out the hard way.  So, I
          will challenge them and they will
          come together.

                         GEORGE
                  (sarcastic)
          Yes sir.

                         SKIPPER
          You know the best thing about being
          a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's
          all my responsibility.  So I'll tell
          you what George, you stay off of my
          bridge, and I'll stay out of your
          galley.  We'll get along that way.

Everyone's quiet, but clear.  Skipper and Alice exit.

                         GEORGE
          Fucking bastard.

Lawford lets out a belly laugh.

                         LAWFORD
          I've seen him snatch the tail of the
          tempest and stuff it, screaming,
          into a bottle.  The bilges are full
          of them.

                         GEORGE
          What do you mean?

                         LAWFORD
          He's been beyond the reach.  To the
          edge of the abyss and back.  He'll
          do well by us all George.  He's a
          real salt.  There's no malice in him
          and there's nothing more dear to him
          than his boys.  So sleep well my
          friend.

Lawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars,
passes one to George and winks.


INT.  GALLEY - DUSK

Robin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching
through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the
horizon.  Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of
food.

                         CHUCK
          How ya doing?

                         ROBIN
                  (without turning)
          Fine.

                         CHUCK
          Good.

                         ROBIN
          Look, I appreciate, you know, the
          concern and all, but like he said, I
          can take care of myself.

                         CHUCK
          I just brought you something to eat.

Robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods.  They
stand silently.  It's awkward.

                         CHUCK
          I feel like I got you into this.

                         ROBIN
          Forget it.

                         CHUCK
          I'm used to spending a lot of time
          alone.  I guess that's what I
          thought it would be out here.  But,
          it's not is it?

                         ROBIN
                  (beat)
          I'm sorry I left you hanging up
          there.

                         CHUCK
          It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm
          just sorry you got chewed out.

Robin nods.  They both stare out at the rising moon.

                         ROBIN
          My brother and I used to climb to
          the top of this old beech tree in
          the back yard and watch the moon
          come up just like this.  My parents
          would fight all the time so we'd
          sneak out there where we couldn't
          hear 'em and recite scenes from our
          favorite movies.

Robin grows quiet.

                         ROBIN
          Would you believe I miss it?  The
          middle of paradise and I'm homesick.

Chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back.

                         CHUCK
                  (ironic)
          Well, I wouldn't worry.  It'll all
          be there when we get back.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls
and pitches.  Chuck sees Terry heaving over the side.
John and Tod hear the sound and turn.

                         JOHN
                  (disgusted)
          Come on man.  Show a little
          backbone!
                  (to Tod)
          You believe that?!

Tod is fixated on Terry.  Suddenly, without warning, he
breaks for the rail and lets fly.

Phil and Charlie are next.  Chris climbs through the
companionway but doesn't make it to the side.  Spontaneous
regurgitation.  Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheel
housing to avoid being sprayed.  Suddenly everyone is
heaving.

                         CHRIS
          Sorry.

                         LAWFORD
                  (to Bill)
          We're gonna have nobody left up here
          to crew.  Better let Skipper know.

Bill nods and disappears.  John joins Chuck watching the
events around him.

                         JOHN
          Well Gieg, I'm glad to see I'm not
          the only guy on this boat that can
          take a little rock'n roll.  Bunch of
          wusses, I swear...!

Chuck watches each of his shipmates.  Then, suddenly, out
of nowhere -- Projectile vomit all over John.  He looks at
Chuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail.

                         JOHN
          Son of a bitch!!

Chuck looks at John, furious with himself, and begins to
laugh.  But after a moment he starts to laugh too.  It's
infectious, they crack each other up.  Then, in the middle
of belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over
the side.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY

Skipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in
front of him.  There's a knock on the door.

                         SKIPPER
          Come in.

                         BILL
          Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much
          doing group boot over the side.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, that's all part of it.

                         BILL
          We've got weather moving in from the
          west.

Skipper looks up.

                         SKIPPER
          That's part of it, too.


EXT.  DECK - DUSK

Skipper stands at the wheelhouse with Lawford, George and
Bill, studying the horizon through binoculars.  Dark
clouds.  Chuck watches Skipper.  Everyone, looking for a
cue.

                         CHUCK
          That a... storm, Skipper?

Skipper stays glued to the binoculars.

                         SKIPPER
          Uh, huh.

                         CHUCK
          Would you, um, say it's a big storm?

                         SKIPPER
          Sometimes it gets exciting out here.

                         LAWFORD
          What do you think?

                         SKIPPER
          Barometer's dropping.  The first
          blow'll come from the south.  Might
          get interesting.

                         CHUCK
          Shouldn't we turn away?

                         SKIPPER
          You can't run from the wind son.
          You trim your sails, face the music
          and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's
          close her up, dog, tight.

Close on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched
tight.

BELOW DECKS

Bulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly.

IN THE GALLEY

Pots and pans crash around.

IN THE MAIN CABIN

The cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books
on top of Alice.  She turns and looks at the mess,
annoyed.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

                         SKIPPER
          Furl the squares, reef the main, and
          bend on the storm jib, but keep it
          furled.  Drop everything but the
          inner jib.  I want everybody down
          before we get any lightning.

Bill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders.  Most of
the crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging and
begin dropping sail.

                         GEORGE
          Why's it always happen at night?

Skipper regards George, annoyed.

                         SKIPPER
          George... I want hot food in
          everybody.  Get to it.

George returns to the galley.  Alice joins Skipper at the
wheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear.

                         ALICE
          Looks like weather.

                         SKIPPER
          Yep.

He slips on a yellow slicker.

                         SKIPPER
          Do me a favor and tell Bill once
          she's dogged down I want everyone to
          break out their slickers and make
          sure their gear is stowed or we'll
          spend the next week sorting
          underwear.
                  (to the others)
          Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil
          will stand the watch.  Everyone else
          hit the racks.

                         PHIL
                  (impulsively)
          I'm not staying out here.

Skipper fires off a look that frightens even Phil.

                         SKIPPER
          No.  That's for sure.  Charlie, take
          his place.

Phil goes below, a little ashamed.  The crew scatters.
Chuck, still at the wheel, pipes up.

                         CHUCK
          If it's all the same, I'd like to
          stay on deck.

Skipper regards Chuck, who looks back with both fear and
eagerness.  Suddenly he sees something in this kid.  Maybe
himself.  He almost smiles.  Almost.

                         SKIPPER
          Take the wheel.


EXT.  FORETOP - SAME

Dark clouds blot out the sky and stars.  Thunder rumbles
far away.  The seas have built but there's no wind... yet.
With no steerage, the ship is tossed.

Tod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl.
The mast swings from side to side, but the air has gone
dead calm.  Skipper looks up, anticipating.

                         SKIPPER
          Everyone out of the rigging NOW!

                         BILL
          Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!

                         TOD
                  (shouting)
          HERE IT COMES!!

ON THE DECK

The crew in the rigging scamper down to the safety of the
deck.

                         SKIPPER
          Bill, on the wheel with Chuck.

Bill joins Chuck and takes hold of the wheel.  Then it
hits.

A wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of
thunder and flashing lightning.  The bow explodes through
twelve foot swells.  This is what the Albatross was born
to do.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

It's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks.  Pots
crash, books and personals go flying.  The guys are
scared.

ON DECK

The main and jib sheets tighten.  Skipper looks at Chuck
and Bill.  It all comes down to moments like these and he
loves it.

Suddenly, there is a loud CRACK!  A violent flapping
noise.  Skipper leaps to the port and looks forward.  Tod
comes running back.

                         TOD
          We blew the inner!

                         ALICE
          I'll go.

                         SKIPPER
          Bring it down and run up the storm
          jib.  We'll fix it later.  Stay out
          of reach of the blocks!

Tod and Alice disappear.

                         SKIPPER
                  (with a twinkle)
          Well, we're in it now.

Chuck studies him, frightened, but reassured.


EXT.  BOW - SAME

The shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind.
The block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it.  No
one dares go near it.  For a moment, it seems to hang
there seductively.  John, naive of its power, leaps for
the rail and grabs it.

                         ALICE
          NOOO!!!

Suddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John
high off the deck and over the side.  He holds on for dear
life, screaming.

AT THE WHEEL

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Chuck)
          Hold her steady.

Skipper bolts forward.

AT THE BOW

Alice uncleats the jib halyard, leaving one turn on the
pin and shoves it into Tod's hands.

                         ALICE
          Release this when I tell you!!

Skipper joins Tod as Alice scrambles along the deck and
pulls herself into the bowsprit netting.  When the block
and jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail
yelling...

                         ALICE
          NOW!!!

As John is snapped inboard Alice leaps up, grabbing the
sail, leaning out over the open water.  Waves explode
through the netting.  As Tod releases the halyard, John
falls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive.  Lawford
and Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit.

Skipper looks her over.  Relieved.  No broken bones.  Good
work.  But then this is what he expects.  He respects her
and now, everyone can see why.  He looks at John sprawled
on the deck.

                         SKIPPER
          Be careful will ya?

                         JOHN
          What ever you say Cap...

                         SKIPPER
          Let's get that storm jib up.

Skipper gives Alice a private look, then returns to the
stern where Chuck holds tightly onto the wheel.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          The storm lasted sixteen hours and
          it set us all on equal footing.  It
          was the first time that we shared an
          episode on an even plane.  As we
          stood our watches we were equally
          out of control of our situation,
          regardless of our physical abilities
          or social backgrounds.  And though
          our real feelings lay hidden beneath
          bravado and defiance, we were no
          longer strangers.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The crew is cleaning up.  Alice supervises repairs to the
jib while others stow line, scrub the deck and chip paint.
Lawford paces.

                         LAWFORD
          You know what they say in the Navy
          don't you?

                         RICK
          What's that, Big Daddy?

The more experienced crew members have heard this all
before.

                         LAWFORD
          "If it moves, salute it.  If it
          doesn't move, pick it up.  If it's
          too big to pick up, paint it!"

The boys mockingly salute Lawford as he walks by.  John
stands before a porthole combing his Brylcreem hair into a
"D.A."

Mike and Chris climb on deck with several large boxes.

                         MIKE
          Ladies, gentlemen and
          hermaphrodites, Mr. Corry and I are
          happy to announce the grand opening
          of Trans-Border Enterprises.

They start opening the boxes.  One is a case of Coca Cola,
another is full of cigarettes and candy.

                         CHRIS
          All of the creature comforts and
          vices you could possibly want, at
          home or abroad, available twenty-
          four hours a day.

                         MIKE
          For a price, of course.

                         ROBIN
          If you've got "a broad" available
          I'll take her.

                         JOHN
          Like you'd know what to do with one.

The crew shakes their heads, mutter and check out the
goods.

                         TERRY
          You got Marlboro's?

                         CHRIS
          Absa-fuckin-lutely.

                         CHUCK
          Toss me a Cola.

                         CHRIS
          Fifty cents.

                         CHUCK
          What?!!

                         MIKE
          Contraband's hard to come by out
          here son.

John is still grooming at the window.

                         PHIL
          Hey Goodall, you got a date or
          something?

John continues to comb.

                         JOHN
          Yeah.  With your mom.

                         EVERYBODY
          Oooooooo.

Phil slinks away.

                         CHRIS
          We also have a few rental items...

Chris displays a Playboy magazine.  Everybody clamors to
get a look.

                         MIKE
          There's a penalty for any material
          returned to the Trans-Border Library
          with sticky pages.

John walks by, snatches the magazine and heads for his
bunk flipping through the pages.

                         MIKE
          Hey, you can't do that!!
                  (to Chris)
          He can't do that!!

John flops in a deck chair.  Chris shakes his head and
starts closing up the boxes.

                         CHRIS
          Sure he can.


EXT.  STERN - LATER

Chuck sits alone, away from the others, reading.  On cue,
half of the crew descend, dragging him kicking and
screaming into the bowswain's chair, and over the side.
The guys cheer.

                         CHUCK
          Come on you guys, this isn't funny!

The seat spins, twists and swings from behind the boat.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on Chucky.  Show us a little
          grit.

They lower the chair so it glides just above the surface.
When the boat noses into a swell Chuck gets quite a ride.
Once he has the hang of it, fear turns to elation.

                         CHUCK
          YEEE HAAAA!!!!!

                         CHARLIE
          Okay, who's next?

                         PHIL
          You gotta be kidding?  He's a human
          chum line!

                         RICK
          No self respecting shark is gonna
          take a bite out of you.

Chuck's hauled back in and Terry pushes his way to the
front of the line.

                         TERRY
          I'm next!

Terry goes over the side.  Once he gets the hang of it, he
gets into it.  He maneuvers the chair like a plane,
forcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back
to the surface.

OFF THE PORT SIDE

Robin is trolling.  The line takes a tremendous hit and
Robin's reel screams.  Tod is at the wheel and turns.

                         TOD
          There she blows!!

Two hundred feet out something large and pissed has taken
the bait.  The crew turn and look.  Skipper looks out at
Terry still in the bowswain's chair.

                         SKIPPER
          Get him in.

Bill waves at Terry to come on in.

                         BILL
          Come on in!!!

Terry waves him off and disappears back under the waves.
They can't pull him up while he's going under the water.

                         SKIPPER
          Do it now Bill.

Terry pops up, pissed that they're reeling him back in.

Suddenly the animal on the other end of Robin's line
explodes out of the sea.  It's a six foot Thresher shark.
Terry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and
screaming.

                         TERRY
          Get me out!!!  Get me out!!!

                         MIKE
          Oh my god!!  It's a...

                         SKIPPER
                  (calmly)
          Shark.
                  (to Robin)
          Don't lose it son.

George grabs a gaffing hook while Robin fights the rod,
trying to bring in the big fish.

                         GEORGE
          Keep it coming.

Robin battles the fish.  George clumsily tries to help.
The crew make their way to the rear to watch.

                         CHARLIE
          Whoops.

Charlie and Rick and the others heave to get Terry up.
Finally he makes it.  Sprawling onto the deck.

                         TERRY
          Oh Jesus!  Oh Jesus Christ!!

The crew turn and cheer Robin on as he brings the shark
alongside.

                         GEORGE
          He must be two hundred pounds!
          Bring him in close and try to hold
          him steady.

George leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook
into a gill.  Several of the boys hold onto him as the
fish flops around violently.

                         GEORGE
          Got him!

Skipper comes down to inspect the catch.  The shark is
longer than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water,
snapping and twisting.  Terry stands shaking, freaked.
All of them are.

                         RICK
          Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister
          Mary Anne's butt.

The guys laugh nervously.  Terry just stares at the man
eater, but it's infectious.  After a moment he's laughing
too.  Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, now you have something to
          write home about.

More laughter.  Suddenly, Tom, who is lookout on the
foretop, cries out.

                         TOM
          Land ho!!!  Land ho!!!

Everyone turns around to look.  The guys at the stern let
go of George and he nearly tumbles overboard.  In that
instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears
back into the sea.  Robin and George share a stunned look.

                         GEORGE
          Shit.

                         ROBIN
          There's more where that came from.

Skipper returns to the wheelhouse with Alice.  Together
they scan the horizon.  Clouds build over the land ahead.

                         ALICE
          Cheated death again.

He slips an arm around her.

                         SKIPPER
          Yep.


EXT.  ANTIGUA - HARBOR - DAY

A group of islanders have assembled to watch the crew
approach in the long boats.


INT.  LONG BOAT - SAME

Chuck gazes across the strange landscape.  As the boats
dock, the crew pile out and scatter.  Local children
follow them wherever they go.  Chuck, Robin and John find
themselves alone.  Most of the buildings are primitive.
They wander over to a shop.

                         ROBIN
          What do you say?  Cokes?  I'm
          buying.

                         CHUCK & JOHN
          Sure.


EXT.  SHOP

Chuck and Robin reappear, sipping cold Cokes.  Mike and
Chris walk by across the street.  Robin speaks up loud
enough for them to hear.

                         ROBIN
          You're right Chuck.  There's nothing
          quite as refreshing as a cold ten
          cent Coke that only costs ten cents!

The three clink their bottles.  Mike and Chris slink away.


EXT.  COLONIAL FORT - DAY

A crumbling fort overlooks the harbor.  Below, the
Albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water.
Large bronze muzzle-loading cannons still lie in their
gunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that
will never come.

Each of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the
Caribbean view.

                         ROBIN
          You think Skipper and Alice do it?

                         CHUCK
          Do what?

                         ROBIN
          Ya know... "It".

                         CHUCK
          That's like wondering if your mom
          and dad do it.  Who wants to know?

                         JOHN
          She isn't that old.

                         CHUCK
          What do you mean?

                         JOHN
          I mean she looks pretty damn good in
          her all-together for being thirty.

                         ROBIN
          How would you know?

                         JOHN
          Trust me donut.  I know.

                         ROBIN
          What?  Come on...

                         JOHN
          On the dog watch, night after the
          storm, I look down into the skylight
          above Skipper's cabin and there she
          was, peelin' down.

                         CHUCK
          No way!

                         ROBIN
          Come on man, what'd they look like?

                         JOHN
          Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like
          a guy who ain't never seen a pair.

                         ROBIN
          I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.

They crack up.

                         CHUCK
          I walked in on my parents one time.
          It was only like eight o'clock and
          they were in bed and I thought that
          was kinda weird so I just walked in.

                         JOHN
          That's what they get for not locking
          the door.

                         CHUCK
          So I'm standing there and you could
          hear a pin drop.  No breathing or
          snoring... Suddenly it hits me that
          somethin' was goin' on that just
          stopped, really fast, like people
          are holding their breath.

                         ROBIN
          So... What happened?

                         CHUCK
          My mother says in this really low,
          but very awake kind of voice "What?"

John and Robin crack up.

                         ROBIN
          What'd you do?

                         CHUCK
          I said "Sorry, wrong room" and
          walked away.

                         JOHN
          Did you shut the door at least?

They bust up again.  Chuck glares back.

                         CHUCK
          I don't remember.

Robin sits up on his cannon and looks out, suddenly
melancholy.

                         ROBIN
          My parents don't do it anymore.

                         CHUCK
          How do you know?  They might.

                         ROBIN
          'Cause they're getting a divorce.
                  (beat)
          That's why they sent me here.  My
          sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted
          us out of the house so they could
          get down to business.

                         JOHN
          They tell you that?

                         ROBIN
          I figured it out.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah.

                         JOHN
          My old man split along time ago.  It
          doesn't mean anything.  You just
          take care of number one that's all
          that matters.

                         ROBIN
          It matters to me.

                         JOHN
                  (kindly)
          Okay donut.  Whatever you say.

                         CHUCK
          We better get back.

Robin looks up to John.

                         ROBIN
          Did you really see 'em.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - HARBOR - NIGHT

The boat moves off leaving the lights of Antigua behind.
Chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The wind is up and the seas are high.  The ship is under
full sail driving at top speed.  Foam sprays from the bow
as it slices through the water -- what she was born to do.
The crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of
the performance.

Tod is at the wheel with Chris nearby.  The sails tower
above him like a mountain of silk.  He wrestles the wheel,
careful to hold his course against the powerful trade
winds.

Skipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the
compass and nods.

                         SKIPPER
          It's a good sail boys.

Tod and Chris beam.  Compliments are rare from this man.

                         TOD
          Thank you, sir.  Shall we trim the
          main Skipper?  I think we could get
          another knot or two.

Skipper turns and looks at Tod, a twinkle in his eye.

                         SKIPPER
          As you like.

Gravy.  The two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet
tackle.  Phil joins them.

                         PHIL
          What do you say I have a crack at
          the wheel?

                         TOD
          I'd say, fuck off junior.

They laugh.  Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and
angry.  He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart
house.

As Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and
stretches against the powerful wind.

Phil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the
chart house and silently fires.  There is a wicked POP as
the spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed
by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits.

                         TOD
          Jesus Christ!!  Let it out.  Let it
          out!!

The sound brings Skipper onto the deck like a shot.

                         SKIPPER
          Hard to port!  Hard to port!!

Calamity, as Tod cranks the ship into the wind.  The
canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop.  People
dive everywhere to drop sail.

                         SKIPPER
          Start the engine.  All ahead full!!
          Scallop the Square and drop the
          rest!!

He shoots a glare at Tod and Chris.

                         TOD
                  (bewildered)
          I don't know what happened Skipper.
          It just blew out.

Skipper turns to the task at hand without a word.  What
had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and
confusion.

Phil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the
spear gun and smiles to himself at Tod's arrogance turned
humility.


EXT.  DECK - TOBAGO CAYS - DAY

The Albatross has dropped anchor along a remote group of
flat, lush atolls.  Tall palm trees grow almost to the
waters edge.  The crew have the mainsail down and Alice
supervises the repair of the sail.  Phil sits above it all
sunning himself in the bowswain's chair.

                         ROBIN
          Where are you from any way?

                         CHUCK
          Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout
          you?

                         ROBIN
          Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom
          capital of the world'.

                         TOD
          Sorry to here it.

                         CHUCK
          Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya
          know?  Bein' here together an all...

Phil reels himself down.

                         PHIL
          Christ, I'm gonna choke on 'feel
          good'...

Robin looks up, taken back.

                         TOD
          Why are you such a penis Phil.  Do
          you do it on purpose or can't you
          help it.

                         PHIL
          Tug my chain Johnstone.

Skipper comes on deck.  Robin and Chuck flip Phil and
Terry the finger.

                         SKIPPER
          After midterms we'll finish our run
          down to Curacao.

The crew reacts, grumbling.

                         SKIPPER
          I have arranged to host a good will
          cruise for the Dutch students of the
          local school there.

                         PHIL
                  (to Terry)
          Joy, rapture...

                         SKIPPER
          Each one of you will be responsible
          for one student.  I'll expect you to
          be courteous.  You represent this
          school and your country.  We'll sail
          in the morning.

George appears from the galley and rings the ships bell.

                         GEORGE
          That's chow.

The crew drop what they're doing and stampede down into
the cabin.


INT.  CABIN - NIGHT

Robin thrashes in his bunk calling out.  Sweat glistens on
his face.  Chuck stumbles out to his bunk with Rick and
some of the others.

                         RICK
          Hey man, wake up.  Wake up!

They shake him.  Robin wakes, disoriented, eyes filled
with tears.

                         ROBIN
          I was falling...

Phil grumbles from his bunk.

                         PHIL
          Hey, shut up will ya?

                         CHUCK
          It was a bad dream...

                         ROBIN
          It was so real...

                         CHUCK
          Here's the thing; whenever you're
          having a nightmare, all you have to
          do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be
          out of it.  You'll wake up.

Phil rolls over in his bunk trying to go back to sleep.

                         ROBIN
          Who told you that?

                         CHUCK
          My dad.

                         ROBIN
          It works?

                         CHUCK
          Swear to God.  Only good advice he
          ever gave me.  Now, go back to
          sleep.

He pats Robin on the leg.  The guys return to their bunks.
Favor Phil, listening.

                         CHUCK
                  (lingering)
          You okay now?

Robin stares at the photo of his brother.

                         ROBIN
          That's how he died you know.

                         CHUCK
          Who?

                         ROBIN
          My brother.  He fell out of the old
          beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was
          on a camp out.  They started going
          at it, throwin' things, a real knock
          down...
                  (beat)
          They didn't find him 'till the next
          morning.  They didn't even know why
          he was up there.

                         CHUCK
          Jesus, you never told them?

                         ROBIN
          I couldn't.

Phil stares at the ceiling, affected by what he has
overheard.  Someone creeps down the companionway and
whispers.

                         MIKE
                  (hushed)
          Hey you guys, come on!

Shuffling in the darkness.  Phil suddenly realizes, he's
alone.


EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

The dory hangs from her gallows.  Some of the guys slowly
lower her to the water.


INT.  GALLEY - SAME

George is asleep with a book in his lap.  Mike and Chris
slip inside.  The door squeaks, George stirs.  Mike opens
a cabinet and removes a fifth of rum.

Silently, Mike passes the bottle to Chris who passes it to
Tod who passes it to Charlie who drops it down to Robin
who stands in the lowered dory with Chuck.

                         PHIL (O.S.)
          What do you think you're doing?

Startled, Mike and Rick share a look.  Busted.  Phil turns
and runs into John, wearing a broad smile, who shakes his
head.  No way.

                         PHIL
          Forget it.  Count me out!

The crew descend and drag Phil, struggling, into the dory.
They raise a crude sailing rig and silently move off.

A figure stands on top of the chart house, back lit by the
moon.  It's Skipper.  Watching it all.  Letting it unfold.


INT.  GALLEY - NIGHT

Skipper hovers over George, sawing logs.  He tosses a pot
on the floor.

                         GEORGE
                  (bolting up)
          What?!  What's happening?!!

                         SKIPPER
          You're officer of the watch, George.

                         GEORGE
          I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned
          book.  Lawford gave it to me.

The book is "Kafka".  Skipper motions to the empty
cabinet.

                         GEORGE
          Son-of-a-bitch.

                         SKIPPER
          We're short one long boat too.  Come
          on.


EXT.  CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

The boys sit in a circle around a small fire passing the
bottle.  Rick strums his guitar and sings while the rest
join in.

                         RICK
          Oh I was walkin' down Lime street
          one day...

                         ALL
          Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...

                         RICK
          A pretty young maiden she happened
          my way...

                         ALL
          Give me some time to blow the man
          down...

Skipper and George crawl to the top of a sand dune and
watch the boys.  George starts to stand but Skipper puts a
hand on his shoulder.

                         SKIPPER
          I guess we know what the next
          acquisition for the galley is going
          to be...

                         GEORGE
          What's that?

                         SKIPPER
          A padlock.

On the boys.  Phil is drunkest of them all and does a wild
jig as the rest of them sing.

                         RICK
          So to all you sailors who've fought
          wind and whale...

                         ALL
          Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...

                         RICK
          She said "None the better, you all
          go to hell..."

                         ALL
          Give me some time to Blow the man
          down!

They all crack up.

                         CHRIS
          I only have one question.

                         JOHN
          What's that, Canuck?

                         CHRIS
          If we're not on the boat, how come
          the ground is moving?

                         CHUCK
          You think George'll miss the bottle?

                         TERRY
          We'll blame it on Big Daddy.  He's a
          lush.

                         MIKE
          All I know is if that Viking son of
          a bitch puts me on smegma duty one
          more time I'm gonna have to run him
          through.

                         TERRY
                  (mimicking)
          The "Old Man" likes a tight ship!

                         CHARLIE
          "If it moves, shoot it..."

The rest join in.

                         CHUCK
          "If it doesn't move, throw it
          overboard.  If it's too big to throw
          overboard, screw it!"

More laughing.

                         RICK
          You think Old Thunder Nuts will
          figure out that we're A.W.O.L.

Bill drunkenly imitates the Skipper.

                         PHIL
          "There is nothing that goes on, on
          this boat that I don't know about.
          She speaks to me in the night.  So
          don't test me.  Not even a
          little..."

The boys laugh.  On the dune, George shakes his head.

                         GEORGE
          Immortality.

                         SKIPPER
          Spirits have a way of bringing that
          out.

                         GEORGE
          And being sixteen.

                         SKIPPER
          They're in a hurry to grow up.  They
          don't know about consequences or
          responsibility.  That's being
          sixteen too.
                  (beat)
          I promise you one thing...

                         GEORGE
          What's that?

                         SKIPPER
          They'll know about it in the
          morning.

Skipper smiles.


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

The drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach.
As they ready the boat for the trip back Robin looks out
to sea...

                         ROBIN
                  (alarmed)
          Jesus H. Christ.

Tod looks up.

                         TERRY
          What now pork chop?

                         ROBIN
          Look!

The guys turn their gaze to the ocean.  The Albatross...
is gone!

                         TERRY
          Holy shit!  Where'd she go?

The crew is suddenly stone sober.  Stunned.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell is going on?

                         MIKE
          She's gone!  The boat's gone!!

Phil breaks into sort of a blind panic.

                         PHIL
          Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we
          shouldn't have gone.  I tried to
          tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You
          guys made me come!  You made me
          come!!

                         JOHN
          Will you shut up?  You sound like my
          fucking sister.

                         CHUCK
          Alright.  Everybody just stay cool.
          We'll figure this out.

                         MIKE
          Who the hell checked the mooring?

                         ROBIN
          I did.  Why?

                         CHARLIE
          Maybe she pulled free...

                         MIKE
          What if they don't know.  If she's
          adrift, if they're asleep, she could
          run aground.  She could break up on
          the reef.

                         PHIL
                  (to Robin)
          Maybe you didn't check it good
          enough.

                         ROBIN
                  (defensive,
                   frightened)
          I did.  I swear.

Oddly, it's Phil who stands up for Robin.

                         PHIL
          Yeah, well you're really gonna have
          some bad dreams if we find out you
          didn't.

                         JOHN
          That's enough.

                         PHIL
          How the hell are we gonna get outta
          here?

                         JOHN
          We'll think of something.

                         PHIL
          Oh, praise the lord.
                  (announcing)
          Relax everybody.  Everything is
          under control.  The jug head's going
          to think of something.

Without warning.  John lunges at Phil.  Phil screams,
trying to defend himself.  The guys all dive in.  Suddenly
it's an all out brawl.

John out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat
of the boat.

Suddenly, from behind, comes a blistering "THWACK!!" as
Chuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head.
Stunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood dripping
from the back of his head.

                         JOHN
          Nobody calls me an idiot.

He weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand.
The guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover.

                         PHIL
          God damn it man.  I think he broke
          my nose!

                         CHUCK
          Shut up, Phil.

Chuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over and
vomits.

                         TERRY
          Well that's just great.  Now what
          are we supposed to do?

Chuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palm
tree, propping him up.  The others huddle to stay warm.


EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day.  Bloodied
and sun burned.  A fly buzzes around Rick's face, waking
him.  He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus.  He
gazes across the water, stupefied.

                         RICK
          Oh-my-god...

The others stir and follow his gaze.  The Albatross sits
in exactly the spot where they left her.

                         ROBIN
          I'm not sure if this is really good
          or really bad.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY

The sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly.  George tries
to maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his
hands.

                         GEORGE
          I got a live one!

Skipper, Alice and Bill watch the shoreline as the boys
launch the long boat into the surf.  George is struggling.
A beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but Skipper
never takes his eyes off of his boys.

                         SKIPPER
          The thing about fishing George, is
          you need to let 'em run some.  Give
          'em just enough slack so they don't
          break the line.  But at the same
          time you've gotta keep enough
          tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em
          in slowly so they don't really know
          they're hooked.

Suddenly George's line goes slack.  He nearly falls over
backwards.

                         GEORGE
          I'll try and remember that.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

Hound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys
stand before Skipper and the others.  Skipper looks dark
and angry.

                         SKIPPER
          You know what a loose cannon is?
          'Bout the worst thing that could
          happen to a wooden ship.  All it
          took was one, crashing around the
          deck in a storm... It'd smash
          everything in its way, maybe take
          out a mast or punch a hole right
          through the hull.  Think about it,
          just one cannon not tied down, not
          anchored, could take a whole 'Man of
          War' straight to the bottom.

                         MIKE
                  (aside)
          But we don't have any cannons?

Chris jabs him in the ribs.

                         CHRIS
                  (hushed)
          Shut up!

Skipper turns and faces them.

                         SKIPPER
          Now, if the Skipper were smart, if
          he could see a storm building, why
          he'd cut loose every gun on his
          boat.  Even though it would leave
          him at a disadvantage in battle,
          he'd push 'em into the sea.  Better
          chance running for port than risk
          the entire ship, his crew.

He takes a pause making sure he has their attention for
this part.

                         SKIPPER
          People are like that sometimes.
          They cut loose and before you know
          it, they're knocking holes in
          everything.  So you gotta ask
          yourself if it might not be better
          to just put 'em off before they sink
          the whole thing.  I mean after all,
          you can always get new cannons.

He walks back to his place at the rail.

                         SKIPPER
                  (beat)
          I want a tight ship, everybody
          shaved and in clean clothes when we
          make Curacao.  If it goes well, if
          your mid terms are acceptable, I may
          reconsider my decision about the
          rest of the trip.  That's all.

Dejected, the crew goes below.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

Under sail.  Skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the
crew taking exams.  Each writes furiously as Alice
scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the
chart house door.

As the boys scratch out the problems, John seems
paralyzed.  He looks over at Phil and copies down his
answer.  He checks crib notes hidden in his shorts.  Chuck
and Robin both see this and exchange looks.


INT.  AFT CABIN - DAY

John makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the
head.  Robin follows.  Chuck drops down the aft
companionway, intercepting John.

                         CHUCK
          Where you going?

                         JOHN
          To take a piss.

                         ROBIN
          Really?

John turns around, surprised, sandwiched.

                         JOHN
          Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come
          in and shake it for me?

                         CHUCK
          If you're gonna cheat, you might as
          well copy off somebody who's gonna
          get the answer right.

                         JOHN
          You've gotta be kidding.  Get the
          fuck outta my way!

Chuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove John
inside.

                         JOHN
          What the hell!!!

Chuck manages to pin John.  Robin checks his pockets and
comes up with the crib notes.  Chuck lets go.  John
snatches them, ashamed.

                         CHUCK
          Takin' a piss?

John turns away.

                         ROBIN
          Why, man?

                         JOHN
          I don't have to listen to this.

                         CHUCK
          Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you
          don't, I'm gonna go right up there
          and have a heart to heart with
          Skipper and you'll be on the first
          plane back to idiotville.

John lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.  Robin
leaps on top of John.

                         ROBIN
          Cut it out man!!  Stop it!!!  What's
          the matter with you?  If Phil had
          caught you he'd have ratted you out
          in a second.  You get caught
          cheating, you'll get kicked off the
          boat.

John explodes, tears flowing.

                         JOHN
          I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All
          right?!

                         CHUCK
          What?

He lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his
emotions.

                         JOHN
          I doctored my grades so I'd make the
          cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You
          satisfied?!

                         CHUCK
          You're not a moron.

                         JOHN
          Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to
          get through one chapter of Lawford
          and I still don't have any idea what
          the hell he's talkin' about.  You
          know why it takes me so long to
          write papers?  because I can't
          spell.  While everybody else is
          sleeping, I'm in the rack with a
          flashlight and a dictionary.

John chokes back a sob.

                         JOHN
          Hell, they even kicked me outa vo-
          tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide
          rule.

                         PHIL
          I can show you how to use a slide
          rule.

The three turn around, startled.

                         ROBIN
          How long you been standing there?

                         PHIL
          Long enough.

John looks down, resigned.

                         JOHN
          They were gonna put me into special-
          ed this year.  I stole a copy of my
          transcript, changed all the grades.
          Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never
          pass the boards.

                         CHUCK
          Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll
          make sure you get the grades.  We'll
          start a private study group.  Nobody
          knows.  You'll ace that test.

                         ROBIN
          I'm in.

They turn and look to Phil, who still shows the tell-tail
signs of their fight.

                         PHIL
          Me, too.

                         JOHN
          Why would you do that?

                         CHUCK
          Because we believe in you.
                  (beat)
          Because we're your friends.


EXT.  CURACAO - HARBOR - DUSK

As a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the
Albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks
several hundred yards away.  On the dock, the students of
the school wait.  As soon as the ship is in view, they
start to cheer.  Chuck squints.

                         CHUCK
          What are they doing?

                         ROBIN
          I can't make it out?

Robin calls up to Phil, who is at the wheelhouse.

                         ROBIN
          Hey, Phil... Swing up the 'binocs'
          and tell us what you see.

Phil picks up the binoculars and focuses.

                         PHIL
                  (puzzled)
          They're waving... handkerchiefs or
          something.

                         RICK
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          Maybe they're surrendering.

                         PHIL
          Wait a second...

Phil lowers the binoculars and turns to Skipper.

                         PHIL
          They're girls!  They're all girls!

Skipper shares a knowing look with Alice.

                         TOD
          Gimme those.

Tod snatches the binoculars.

                         TOD
          WHHOOOOAAAAA!!!!!!  WOMEN!!!

Everyone on board rushes to the port side.  Every single
person on the dock is a young girl waving a white
handkerchief.  Spontaneous cheers from the boys.

As the 'Big A' pulls to the dock, John and Tod run for the
gunnel door and swing it open.  The girls flood the deck.

                         BILL
          Good morning, ladies.

They chatter in Dutch and hurry aboard.  Like wall
flowers, Robin, Phil and Chuck stand on top of the chart
house watching utopia unfold before them.

                         ROBIN
          What are we supposed to talk about?

                         PHIL
          You've gotta be kidding?

                         ROBIN
          But, they don't speak English.

                         PHIL
          There are some things that everybody
          does in the same language.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, but how are you supposed to
          make the first move?

                         PHIL
          Like this!

Phil reaches up for a free line.  With a running start he
swings out over the water...

                         PHIL
          Yeeee Haaaaa!!

He careens back onto the deck and lands in front of two
startled, but impressed girls.  Robin and Chuck applaud.
Phil takes a bow.  All hell is breaking loose.

Skipper and Alice welcome aboard the headmaster, MS.
BOYDE, 50's, dumpy but tough.

                         SKIPPER
          A very enthusiastic welcome.

                         MS. BOYDE
          We don't often have guests.  Our
          girls have been looking forward to
          your visit for some time.  Welcome
          to Curacao.

                         SKIPPER
          Thank you.  You're all ready to sail
          then?

                         MS. BOYDE
          I should think so.

                         ALICE
          I'm sure they won't be disappointed.

A man's voice bellows up from the dock.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Ahoy there!!

Everyone stops and freezes.  Phil turns, disbelieving.
It's his parents, Francis and PEGGY BOUTILLIER, standing
next to a limousine dressed in brightly colored tourist
garb.

                         PEGGY
          Surprise!

                         FRANCIS
          Well, well.  What do we have here?
          A floating brothel?

                         ALICE
                  (cool)
          Hardly.

Francis comes aboard uninvited as usual.

                         FRANCIS
          Well, we thought we'd drop in and
          see if you were all still in one
          piece.

                         SKIPPER
                  (pointed)
          And, of course, we are.

                         FRANCIS
          Well, you never can tell these days,
          can you?

Skipper shoots a look over at Phil who is staring a hole
in the deck.

                         SKIPPER
          What is it we can do for you today?

                         FRANCIS
          Well, we've come to give our boy a
          little break from the monotony.

                         PHIL
          It's not monotonous.

Francis flushes red.

                         FRANCIS
          Never the less...

He turns and joins Peggy on the dock.  Phil is suddenly
full of rage.  This is an invasion of his privacy.
Everyone feels it.

                         FRANCIS
          Hop to boy.  We haven't got all day.

Phil's anger turns to resigned humiliation.  He stops,
staring down at his parents.  Skipper puts a hand on his
shoulder.

                         SKIPPER
          I didn't know, Phil.

Phil nods, head down and walks down the ramp.  All watch
him go, feeling for him.


EXT.  OPEN WATER - DAY

The sails begin to rise but unlike earlier, the guys SING
out like the Vienna Boys Choir and it's having the desired
impressive effect on the women.

                         CREW TOGETHER
          When the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup/ and not one of us
          was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a
          picture, but it really was the sun/
          then we knew the party was over...

The weather was perfect, brisk and steady under the trade
wind swells.  The voices trail away as the ship moves off.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Curacao seemed out of a dream,
          somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio
          drew further and further away, it
          was home that began to seem unreal,
          drifting somewhere in the foggy
          reaches of our memories.  And I knew
          that each of us was falling in love.
          But not only with these wonderful
          women or the swaying palms and
          porcelain beaches... We were falling
          in love with the experience we were
          sharing, and with who we were
          becoming.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

The crew is getting ready for a farewell party.  Each
member is primping.

                         CHUCK
          Bregitta.  Do you believe it?

                         JOHN
          Believe what?

                         CHUCK
          Her name.
                  (savoring the sound)
          Bregitta.  It's poetry.

                         TERRY
          Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".

                         TOD
          Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're
          talking to a guy whose idea of big
          romance is a palm full of Vaseline.

                         TERRY
          Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't
          seen you swapping spit with anybody.

Tod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket.
It's a pair of girls' cotton underwear.

                         TOD
          That's because I'm discrete, moron.

The guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him.  Just
then Skipper descends the companionway.

                         SKIPPER
          Alright, gentlemen, we sail with the
          tide.  Twenty-three hundred.  Sharp.
          I'm not waiting.  Have a good time
          tonight but be back on time.

The crew cheer.  This means the trip goes on.


EXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT

Decorated with colored paper lanterns and streamers, a
STEEL DRUM BAND softly plays in the b.g.  The crew slow-
dance with their girls, dressed in cotton that seems to
glow against their dark skin.

Ms. Boyde is scrutinizing the body contact between Chuck
and BREGITTA.  Their lips appear pasted together and she
doesn't like it.  Lawford sees what is about to happen and
hands his slimy cigar to George who reacts.

                         LAWFORD
          Hold this, will ya?

Lawford intercepts Ms. Boyde.

                         LAWFORD
          Madam, I would consider it a
          privilege if you would allow me to
          take you on a tour of the dance
          floor.

Ms. Boyde is so flattered, it is all she can do to extend
her hand.  Lawford leads her away and glares at Rick.

                         LAWFORD
          You're very light on your feet Ms.
          Boyde.  Was it you who taught all of
          these young ladies the art of the
          dance?

Ms. Boyde giggles like a school girl.


EXT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Phil and his parents sit outside at a ritzy restaurant.
Phil stares towards the harbor.

                         FRANCIS
          What's wrong, you don't like steak?

                         PHIL
          I should be eating with the crew.

                         FRANCIS
          Humor me.  Eat it anyway.

                         PHIL
          Why are you here?

                         PEGGY
          We missed you.  We wanted to check
          on you.

                         PHIL
          I don't need you spying on me.

                         FRANCIS
          Spying?!

                         PHIL
          I can take care of myself.

                         FRANCIS
                  (sarcastic)
          Oh, really?

                         PHIL
          Look, you put me on this boat in the
          first place.  I didn't want to come
          but I did.  Why do you have to
          embarrass me.  Why can't you just
          leave me alone?

Francis slaps Phil across the face nearly knocking him out
of his chair.  Everyone and everything.  It's humiliating.

                         PEGGY
          Francis!!

She cradles Phil's red face.  He fights the tears.

                         FRANCIS
          Listen to me, you thankless little
          prick.  We're your parents, so don't
          you dare talk to me disrespectfully.
          What the hell is it, this captain?
          Because I'll see him in a rowboat...

                         PHIL
          It has nothing to do with him.

                         FRANCIS
          Well, what does it have to do with?
          Us?

                         PHIL
          No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it
          just be about me?  For once?

Phil pulls free and exits.  He can feel eyes all over him.


EXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT

Alice watches, swept up in the nostalgic romance of it
all.  Skipper joins her.

                         SKIPPER
          He would have loved this.

                         ALICE
          Your father?

                         SKIPPER
          All his years at sea, he never
          stopped talking about these islands.

                         ALICE
          You miss him.

Skipper manages a sad smile.

                         SKIPPER
          Every hour.  Every minute.
                  (pause)
          I wish he was here.  I wish he could
          have sailed our girl.  Seen these
          boys...

She smiles warmly.

                         SKIPPER
          I'd have liked to have said goodbye.

                         ALICE
          He knows.

                         SKIPPER
          You sound so sure.

                         ALICE
          I am about this.

Skipper turns and stares at her deeply.

                         ALICE
          What?

                         SKIPPER
          He never would have believed a woman
          like you existed.

Alice smiles and turns back to the dancers.

                         ALICE
          Do you remember the last time you
          and I danced under the stars?

                         SKIPPER
          Guilty.

                         ALICE
          On the deck of the Yankee, the night
          you asked me to marry you.  We
          weren't much older than they are.

The music changes to a calypso waltz.  Skipper takes Alice
by the hand.

                         SKIPPER
          Would you allow me?

She's sixteen again.  There's something about him that
still makes her blush.

Skipper leads her to the dance floor.  He hesitates,
looking deeply into her eyes.  As they begin to dance, the
boys notice and exchange looks.

Lawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and
smoking cigars.

                         GEORGE
          If I didn't know better I'd say the
          old man was acting almost halfway
          human.

                         LAWFORD
          He is halfway human.

One by one the couples clear for the Skipper and his
bride.  They glide, lost in each others arms.  They dance
a dance for the ages.  As if it might be for the last
time.  The music swells.


EXT.  PIER - NIGHT

Chuck and Bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full
moon hangs above the horizon.  Bregitta doesn't understand
what Chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him.

                         CHUCK
          I can't remember feeling like this
          about myself, a place, someone like
          you.  We've come such a long way,
          seen so much.  But nothing like this.

Bregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand.  He's nervous.

                         CHUCK
          I'm not the best at expressing
          myself.  Maybe the only reason I can
          now is because I know you don't
          understand me.
                  (beat)
          I like you so much.  Too much.  But
          how could I?  I mean, if we can't
          even communicate, how could I know
          you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an
          hour and I'll never see you again.

Bregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses him
tenderly.  Then, in perfect English...

                         BREGITTA
          I like you, too.

Chuck's eyes widen, astonished.  Bregitta smiles, takes
Chuck by the hand, and leads him to a small covered boat
moored to the pier.

                         BREGITTA
          Come on.  We don't have much time.

Blushing deeply, Chuck follows her into the boat.


EXT.  STREET - SAME

Robin walks down the street hand in hand with one of the
girls.  A long string of colored lights illuminate the
length of the street.  Robin clumsily tries to kiss the
girl.  She laughs.

                         ROBIN
                  (defensive)
          What?

Suddenly there's a flash and the sound of breaking glass.
Robin looks up to see Phil staggering, down the street,
smashing each of the colored light bulbs with a stick.  He
showers himself with broken glass and sparks.

                         ROBIN
                  (to girl)
          Wait for me okay.  I'll be right
          back.  I swear.

She smiles sadly and nods.  Robin sprints down the pier
and catches up with Phil.  His feet are bleeding.  He is
completely smashed.

                         ROBIN
          Phil.  What are you doing?

                         PHIL
          Fandango, Junior.
                  (he holds up his
                   stick)
          I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!

                         ROBIN
          No way Phil.  Not like this.

                         PHIL
          Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker
          down the pipe...

THWACK!  He scores another bulb.  Robin jumps out of the
way.

                         PHIL
          It's outta here!

                         ROBIN
          Come on man.  Let's just talk about
          it.

The music drifts from the gardens ahead.  Phil bolts.
Robin chases after him.

                         ROBIN
          Phil!  Wait man... Come on...


EXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT

John shares a joke with Lawford and George.  The calypso
is cranking, but only John hears Phil and Robin crash into
the refreshment table.  Robin struggles to stop Phil.

                         JOHN
                  (to Lawford)
          Be right back.

Lawford nods, oblivious.

ON THE GUYS

John tries to help Robin with Phil.

                         JOHN
          Jesus!  What the hell happened to
          him.

                         PHIL
          Lemme go!  Lemme go!!

                         ROBIN
          I don't know.  We gotta get 'im
          outta here before Skipper sees him
          like this.

                         PHIL
          Son of a bitch!!

Phil kicks and struggles.

                         JOHN
          Phil, if you don't calm down, I'm
          gonna hurt you.  Got it?

They drag him into the darkness.  From near the bandstand
however, Skipper has seen it all.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - NIGHT

The crew lean along the rail waving goodbye to the girls
who wave back with their white handkerchiefs.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Chuck and John hold Phil still as Robin picks shards of
glass out of his feet.  Phil clenches his jaw, but his
eyes are dry.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY

The ship is under full-sail driving before a brisk
following wind.  It takes two on the helm to keep her
safely on course.  Those not on watch are sprawled about
the boat, scraping and 'red-leading' or reading.  Chuck
and Robin sit forward with John, studying.  Lawford paces
the deck, chiding the crew.

                         LAWFORD
          The rust won't wait for you to read
          Conrad, Goodall.

                         JOHN
          Then he shouldn't have written such
          a long poem, Mr. Lawford.

                         LAWFORD
          Read on, young John.  Read on.
          College boards are coming.

John looks down, dejected.  Suddenly Tod cries from the
foretop.

                         TOD
          There they blow!!  There they blow!!
          Dolphins off the bow!!!

Everyone rushes to see.  Dolphins leaping out of the
water.  It's a magnificent game they play with ships.  The
crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close
enough to touch.

Isolated, Phil watches.  Angry, cut off.  Chuck eyes him,
worried.

Bill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick
into the water.  Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere.
Rick pets them as they swim back and forth.  Shear joy.

Phil reaches for the spear gun.  Nobody notices as he
loads and takes aim.

Suddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around.  A large
female dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam
spraying from her blow hole.  She lets out an agonizing
scream.  Phil holds her fast.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Christ!

The crew can only watch, stunned.  Phil is suddenly,
defensive as if waking from a dream.

                         PHIL
          Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.

                         RICK
          No, Phil.  It's a mammal.

Skipper steps on deck, sees the dolphin and Phil with the
spear gun.

                         SKIPPER
                  (quietly)
          Bill, lower a long boat.  We'll
          bring her up with the davit.

A dory is lowered with John and Bill inside.  Once near
the water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a
canvas harness.  The crew hoist her with the davit tackle,
swing her inboard, and gently lower her to the deck.

They gather around the gasping animal.  Alice checks the
wound.  Skipper kneels beside her.

                         SKIPPER
          What do you think?

Alice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin.

                         ALICE
          It's through her lung.

Skipper turns to Phil.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Phil)
          Nice shot.

Phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away.
Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last
to look away.  Skipper grimly walks over to one of the
deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds
it out to Phil.

                         SKIPPER
          Finish it.

Phil looks at the mallet, horrified.

                         PHIL
                  (stammering)
          I'm not gonna kill it.

                         SKIPPER
          You already have.  Now go on.  Do
          it.

Phil backs away.  Skipper stares at him for a moment, then
walks over to the dolphin.  Robin looks away.  The
sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the
animal seems to silence the world.  There are one of two
thumps of her tail and, it's over.

Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and
approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabs
the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the
pieces into the sea.

                         SKIPPER
          What the hell is wrong with you?!

Phil begins to shake with rage.

                         SKIPPER
          Come on.  You got so much fight in
          you; you wanna kill something?  Take
          your best shot.  The first one's
          free.

Robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away.
For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper
up on the challenge.  Then the impulse passes.

                         SKIPPER
          That's what I thought.
                  (beat)
          You're done.  You're going home.

Skipper turns.  The humiliation is more than Phil can
take.  He lunges after Skipper.  Lawford grabs him.  Phil
swings wildly.

                         PHIL
          You mean-assed bastard!!  You son of
          a bitch!!  You can't do this!!!  You
          can't do this!!!  God damn you!!
          God damn you!!

Lawford leads Phil, struggling, below.  The crew surround
the dead dolphin, stunned.


EXT.  ARUBA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

The Albatross is at anchor in the center of the harbor.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

Phil comes on deck from below with his duffel bag.
Everyone feels bad but no one knows what to say.  Phil
turns to get a second load.

                         CHUCK
          Why'd you do it?

                         PHIL
                  (regretting it)
          What's the difference?

                         CHUCK
          You only hurt yourself you know?

                         PHIL
          Like you really care.  Like any of
          you give a shit what happens to me.

                         RICK
          You're the one who doesn't care,
          Phil.

                         PHIL
          It hurts too much to care.

                         RICK
          About yourself?

                         PHIL
          About anything.

Phil turns and disappears down the companionway.

                         ROBIN
          We shouldn't be putting him off the
          boat.

                         CHRIS
          The guy's out of control.

                         ROBIN
          Everybody's been outta control on
          this trip.
                  (beat)
          Are we a crew or not?  I mean, isn't
          that what this is supposed to be all
          about?

                         MIKE
          You're the last person who should be
          whining about being a "crew".

                         ROBIN
          How do you figure that?

                         MIKE
          Well, I'd sure like to go into the
          subject of vertigo and all, but I
          wouldn't want you to piss yourself.

Robin flushes bright red.  John fires a look at Mike.

                         JOHN
          You're a regular prick you know
          that?

                         MIKE
          Tell it to the dolphin, Goodall.

                         JOHN
          Everybody deserves a second chance,
          ya know?  We'd do the same for you
          Mike.

                         ROBIN
          It's about family isn't it?  I mean
          are we together on this or not?

There is a long pause.  Mike and Chris cave.

                         MIKE
          Hell, do what ever you want.  It
          won't change anything anyway.

Robin exchanges a glance with Chuck and together, they
climb up the companionway.


EXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

Chuck and Robin stand before the door.

                         ROBIN
          I can't go in there.

                         CHUCK
          What are you talking about.

Robin turns away, ashamed.

                         ROBIN
          The guys were right.  It'll mean
          nothing coming from me.  He'll
          listen to you Chuck.  Everybody
          does.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

Skipper and Alice have paperwork spread out in front of
them.  A knock.

                         SKIPPER
          Come.

Chuck enters, awkward.

                         SKIPPER
          What's on your mind?

                         CHUCK
          I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.

Skipper looks up.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, spit it out.

                         CHUCK
          The fact is... We'd like you to give
          Phil another chance.

Alice raises her eyebrows, surprised.

                         SKIPPER
          Can't do it.

                         CHUCK
          Sir...?

                         SKIPPER
          Close the door.  Sit down.

Chuck does as he is told.

                         SKIPPER
          Why do you think I'm sending him
          home?

                         CHUCK
          He killed the dolphin.

Skipper looks at Chuck for a moment.

                         SKIPPER
          The Dolphin was a symptom.

                         CHUCK
          Of what?

                         SKIPPER
          Of a fight he can't win out here.

                         CHUCK
          It's his father sir.  He's
          suffocating him.  We've all seen
          it...

Suddenly it's as if Chuck is talking about his own life.

                         CHUCK
          I mean he has all these expectations
          and he doesn't even know who his own
          kid is.  What right did then have to
          show up here?

                         SKIPPER
          They have every right Chuck.

                         CHUCK
          They send us because they want us to
          change, or grow up or something and
          then they try to keep us the same.

Skipper sits up and studies Chuck for a moment.

                         SKIPPER
          Let me tell you something about
          Phil's father, and your's too.  How
          do you think you got here?  You
          think this is all free, that they
          owe you something?  You think they
          enjoy riding subways and commuter
          trains, driving buses or pulling
          lobster traps?  Work fifty weeks a
          year to keep you in tennis shoes and
          private school?  Look around at how
          the rest of the world lives Chuck.
          We're the luckiest people alive,
          every one of us.  They gave it up
          for you and Phil, and me too my
          friend.

Chuck chews on it.

                         SKIPPER
          There are ground rules in families
          just like on this boat.  If you and
          Phil don't like it, I'm sorry.
          Someday you'll understand that, and
          if you're lucky, you'll come home
          and find your best friend has been
          there all along waiting for you to
          forgive him for being a father.
          It'll be the way it used to be,
          when you were ten and your dad was a
          giant.

Now it's Skipper who is talking about himself.

                         SKIPPER
          Does Phil know how you guys feel?

                         CHUCK
          I don't know.

                         SKIPPER
          You should tell him.  That's
          something he can take with him.

Chuck nods and leaves.


EXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

As Chuck exits he meets Robin's eyes.  He shakes his head.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

Skipper returns to his paperwork but can feel Alice
watching him.  He senses it.

                         SKIPPER
          I'm all ears.

Alice smiles.

                         ALICE
          You may not like what you hear.

                         SKIPPER
          I can take it.

                         ALICE
          They've become what you wanted.
          They're a crew.  That's why he came.

Skipper puts a loving hand on Alice's shoulder.

                         SKIPPER
          Why did we begin this?

                         ALICE
          We were idealists.

                         SKIPPER
          Because we believed we could make an
          impact out here.  Self reliance and
          community through the disciplines of
          sailing.

                         ALICE
          I haven't forgotten.

                         SKIPPER
          Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's
          just striking out at the world.

                         ALICE
          He has a lot of hurt inside him.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, he better learn to own it.
          Actions have consequences.
                  (beat)
          It's not what happens here Alice,
          it's what they take away with them.

Alice runs her hands across his face.

                         ALICE
          You're still an idealist.

Skipper turns and slips into her arms.

                         SKIPPER
          Oh hell...


EXT.  DECK - DAY

Phil is in the long boat with Skipper, ready to shove off.
Tension is high.  It's as though they're all waiting for
Skipper to give Phil a reprieve.  But, it's not coming.
They mumble goodbyes.  Terry and Rick pass down Phil's
bags.

                         RICK
          Good luck.

Phil nods and turns to Skipper.

                         PHIL
          I'm ready.

Skipper starts to pull the oars to make the crossing to
the dock as the crew watches them go.  Robin turns,
staring at the ships bell.


EXT.  DOCK - SAME

Skipper ties off the boat and Phil hands up his bags.  A
black limousine waits, brooding.  Phil climbs up with
Skipper and stands, stares at it.  The back door opens,
but nobody gets out.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME

The crew stand, watching.

                         CHARLIE
          His ol' man's gonna eat him for
          lunch.

                         JOHN
          I know what that's like.

                         RICK
          Yeah.

Then, suddenly...

                         CHUCK
          My god...

All stares aloft.  In the rigging, climbing up the mast,
is Robin.  With the ships bell in his teeth, he is
sweating every rung.  Perspiration glistens on his brow.
The crew watches, transfixed as he fights his way towards
the foretop.


EXT.  DOCK - SAME

Phil turns to Skipper.  Working up some courage to say
something, anything.  But all that comes out is...

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry.

A pause between them.

                         SKIPPER
          I know, Phil.

Skipper extends a hand and they shake.  Phil is about to
turn, when a familiar sound draws their attention.


EXT.  FORETOP - SAME

Robin, holding on for dear life at the top of the mast,
rings the ships bell triumphantly over his head, waving to
Phil.  Victorious.  Ding ding!  Ding ding!  Ding ding!
The crew begin to cheer.


EXT.  DOCK - SAME

Phil stares back, fighting his emotions.  Slowly he raises
his hand in a single wave of acknowledgement.  The ringing
stops as his eyes meet Robin's.  Waves back.  Skipper
turns.

                         SKIPPER
          They never gave up on you, you know.

Phil chews on it.  Then...

                         PHIL
          Tell 'em I said... thanks.
                  (beat)
          Goodbye Skipper.

ROBIN'S POV

Robin watches as the limo pulls away.  He rings the bell
wildly.  The crew below wave in a show of silent protest.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          As Robin rang him out, we waved in
          silent protest against Skipper's
          decision.  And in the days that
          followed the low morale was matched
          only by a sense of arrogance that
          perhaps the master should step down
          and let his students take over.

AERIAL SHOT

Robin, the Albatross and the drama unfolding below spin
slowly away as we climb, turning, higher and higher.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Foam sprays from her bow as the Albatross slices through
the swells.


INT.  CABIN - SAME

Tod exits the head with a worried look on his face.  He
grabs Chuck by the arm and pulls him aside.  Morale is
extremely low.

                         TOD
          Listen man, I think I have a
          problem.

                         CHUCK
          We all have problems.

                         TOD
          I'm pissin' fire man.

Chuck reacts.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY

Tight on Alice.  Pull back to reveal Tod standing in front
of her with his shorts down around his ankles.  Mortified.

                         ALICE
          Have a nice time in Curacao, did you
          Tod?

Alice gets up and moves to her medicine chest.  Tod starts
to pull up his shorts.

                         ALICE
          Not so fast.

She pulls out a menacingly large looking hypodermic
needle.  Tod's embarrassment turns to alarm.


EXT.  DECK - LATER

The crew stand in line, pissed.  Lawford and George man
the deck with Skipper and exchange amused looks.  The door
opens and Chris exits, red faced, rubbing his backside.
He glares at Tod who sits on the paint locker.

                         CHRIS
          Way-ta-go Valentino.  I never even
          copped a feel in Curacao.

                         TOD
          Yeah well, your sexual orientation
          is not my problem.

                         RICK
          Man, is there a social disease you
          haven't had?

                         CHARLIE
          So much for vestal virgins.

Lawford swings up a pair of binoculars.  A vessel under
power is coming up fast behind them.  He holds the binocs
out to Skipper.

                         LAWFORD
          What do you make of that?

Skipper turns and looks.

                         SKIPPER
          I don't know.

The ship pulls along the port side, keeping a couple
hundred yards between them.  The boys move to the rail.
George sees them first.

                         GEORGE
          Jesus.  She's got guns.

                         SKIPPER
          She's Cuban.

Everyone becomes alarmed.  Even Alice looks concerned.
Suddenly a puff of smoke discharges from the gun boat.

                         SKIPPER
                  (shouting)
          GET DOWN!  EVERYBODY DOWN!!

The entire crew hit the deck as a shell rockets across the
bow exploding in the water.

                         SKIPPER
          Jesus, we're Americans!!!  We're
          Americans!!!

Skipper grabs the American flag and starts waving it.

                         TERRY
          Jesus, they're gonna sink us!!

                         SKIPPER
          Bill drop everything.  Do it now!

The crew scrambles for the rigging, frantically dropping
sail.

                         SKIPPER
                  (hitting each word)
          Who the hell do they think they are?

As the sail comes down, the Albatross slows to a stop.
The Cubans inch closer and begin speaking over a loud
speaker in Spanish.  The seas are high and the two ships
rise and fall with the large swells between them.

                         GEORGE
          They want us to identify ourselves.

Chuck returns with a bull horn.

                         SKIPPER
          Tell them we're the American School
          Ship, Albatross.

George replies in Spanish over the bull horn.  The Cubans
answer.

                         GEORGE
          They think we're carrying Cuban
          refugees.
                  (beat)
          Skipper, they mean to board us.

                         SKIPPER
          Not a chance.  Remind them that
          according to the Geneva Convention,
          firing on a civilian vessel on the
          high sea is an act of war.

Another exchange between George and the Cubans.  The crew
lay flat on the deck, terrified.

                         GEORGE
          They say they are acting on the
          direct authority of Fidel Castro.

Skipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail.  The
Cuban Captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps
into the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels
around pointing both barrels at the Albatross.  Skipper
stands firm, between the shrouds.  Silence.  A standoff.

                         SKIPPER
          Tell 'em to come aboard.

George sends the return message.  There is a pause, then
the murmurs of the relieved crew.  Skipper swings down but
never takes his eyes off the gunboat.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to crew)
          We've come a long way gentlemen.
          But this is no time for heroes.  I
          know you're much more, but I need you
          to be boys right now.  That's an
          order.  Now scatter and find your
          passports.


INT.  CABIN - DAY

Laundry, books and mementos go flying as each boy
scrambles to dig up his passport.  Terry sits among his
things, dazed.  Bill notices.

                         BILL
          What's wrong?


EXT.  DECK - DAY

A small launch filled with Cuban soldiers approaches the
Albatross.  The crew climb on deck and line up along the
Chart House with their passports.  Lawford walks up to
Skipper.

                         LAWFORD
          We've got a problem.

                         SKIPPER
          What's that?

                         LAWFORD
          Terry left his passport in Curacao.
          We could hide him...

                         SKIPPER
          No.  Bring him on deck with the
          others.

The Cubans cast their lines up and climb aboard carrying
side arms.  Terry reluctantly joins his crew mates.  The
COMMANDING OFFICER faces Skipper as his men go down the
line checking the passports.  Others search the ship.

                         COMMANDER
          Chicken is a fool's game captain.

                         SKIPPER
          So is violating international law.

                         COMMANDER
          But you invited is aboard.

                         SKIPPER
          Your cannons made a compelling
          argument.

One of the Cubans pulls Terry out of line and brings him
forward.  He alerts the Commander in Spanish.

                         COMMANDER
          Stow away?

                         SKIPPER
          He left his passport in Curacao.
          It's being mailed to Panama.

                         COMMANDER
          That is unfortunate.  We'll have to
          take him with us.

Terry is petrified.

                         LAWFORD
          If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a
          dress.

                         SKIPPER
          Nobody aboard my ship is going
          anywhere.

Skipper stares him down.  The Commander signals to one of
his men who disappears into the Chart House.

                         COMMANDER
          Perhaps in appreciation for our
          country's pursuit of peace, you
          might offer us some, token of
          gratitude.

Skipper doesn't really have a choice.

                         SKIPPER
          What do you want?

The Cuban returns from the Chart House with the Ships
sextant and hands it to the Commander.

                         COMMANDER
          This.  And...

Pointing to the ships compass.

                         COMMANDER
          ... and that.

                         GEORGE
          You've got to be kidding!!

                         SKIPPER
                  (cold)
          Take it.

Without hesitation the Cubans pull the large brass compass
from its base.

                         SKIPPER
          Now, get the hell off my ship.

As they leave the ship, they pause.  The Commander looks
back at the Skipper, then deliberately drops both sextant
and compass into the sea.

                         COMMANDER
          You'll really have something to
          teach your students now.

Skipper stands towering above them.  The Cuban captain
smiles up at him.  Amazingly, Skipper addresses him in
perfect Spanish.

                         SKIPPER
          Las estrellas es lo unico, que un
          marinero verdadero se mesesita para
          encontrarse.  Verdade Patron?

The Cubans stare back, frowning, amazed as they motor
away.

The crew are stunned by what they have just witnessed.
Skipper turns and meets the eyes of admiration, humility
and complete respect.  He joins Alice at the helm.  They
linger for a moment.

                         CHUCK
          What'd he say?

George smiles, impressed as well.

                         GEORGE
          He told them real sailors need only
          the stars.

With a new attitude, they turn to Skipper.

                         SKIPPER
          Alright then, let's get outta here.

The crew bolt to there positions.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          With staff and string he showed us
          how to build a sextant.  As we rode
          the trades, he shared the ancient
          secrets of how to read the waves and
          follow stars.  And some mornings
          later, bathed in the orange glow of
          a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea
          like a phoenix.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - PANAMA CANAL - DAY

Panama appears on the horizon.  The Albatross is dwarfed
by the huge freighters moored around her, as she moves
through the locks.  The crew stand on deck in quiet
reverence.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

The sounds of slumber fill the cabin.  All seems well with
the world.  Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.  A huge
bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a
trident in his hand.

Chuck wakes with a start.  He bolts upright to see the
horrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering
before him.  He tries to scream, but hands cover his
mouth.  He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.


EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

The Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship.
Where the sails once were, only shredded fabric.  All of
the crew have been brought on deck.  Powdered faces glow,
surreal.

John's head has been shaved into a mohawk.  Robin, Rick
and Chris have been reduced to crew cuts.  The shears
start over Chuck's head.  Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY
JONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge
with the rest of the crew.

                         NEPTUNE
          Hold fast that polliwog and make him
          presentable.

Chuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face
powdered.

                         NEPTUNE
          Let it be known that on this day in
          the year nineteen hundred and sixty-
          one there appeared within the limits
          of my royal kingdom, the sailing
          ship brigantine Albatross, bound for
          Galapagos.  All vessels that sail my
          domain shall be subject to the
          scrutiny of the underworld...

Terry is brought topside kicking and screaming.

                         NEPTUNE
          Silence!!!

Terry shuts up and succumbs to the same fate as the rest.

                         NEPTUNE
          Tonight you shall all enter the
          Order of the Shellbacks.  Only when
          you have been duly initiated shall
          you enjoy the mysteries and
          protection of the trident.  So, let
          the festivities begin...


EXT.  HELM - NIGHT

Neptune and his court sit smoking Havana cigars as each
member of the crew present themselves.  Robin dressed like
a pig and crawls around snorting.

John's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does
a rain dance.  Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet,
hops around like a frog.  Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's
girlfriend and must sing everything he says.  Charlie is
dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck.
Frenetic chaos.


EXT.  DECK - LATER

Neptune and his court lead a procession around the
perimeter of the deck.  The crew follows.  They stamp
their feet and chant.

                         ALL
          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!
          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!
          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!

They move faster and faster around the boat.  They shout
louder and louder, faster and faster until they have all
worked themselves into a frenzy.


EXT.  BOW - DAWN

Davey Jones, holds a large turtle shell over the crews
heads.  As each one passes before him he pours blood from
the turtle shell onto their heads.  It runs down,
streaking their floured faces and necks.  As the ritual
progresses, Neptune speaks.

                         NEPTUNE
          By virtue of the power inherited by
          me, I do hereby command all of my
          subjects, such as mermaids, sea
          serpents, dolphins, whales, sharks
          and turtles, from eating, playing
          with, or otherwise molesting this
          vessel or her crew.  Let it be
          remembered that on this, my
          Equatorial Domain on Longitude 88'
          20' 13" on this 532nd in the year of
          the dolphin, you entered the Order
          of the Shellbacks!!

The crew cheer and embrace.  Skipper calls from the wheel.

                         SKIPPER
          Land ho!


EXT.  GALAPAGOS ISLANDS - DAY

The crew stop their celebrating and gather at the port
bow.  Ahead, glowing orange with the dawn, the islands of
Galapagos.  It's desolate landscape of silent volcanoes
and ancient lava flows that spill into the sea.

The faces of the boys, still streaked with the indignities
of the night's ordeal, stand silently before their final
destination.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          We had journeyed over six thousand
          miles to the very edge of the earth.
          Like Darwin before us, we would
          witness the bliss of nature in the
          absence of man.  And it was as if
          the Albatross had forded time,
          leaving it behind.  In the heat of
          those equatorial days, on the virgin
          onyx beaches and shifting coral
          dunes, one could expect to find
          sunning iguanas, nesting frigates
          and perchance... the footprints of
          God.


EXT.  BEACH - SHIPWRECK BAY - DAY

The Albatross rests at anchor.  On the beach, the crew
watch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the
ancient guano cliffs.  So unaccustomed are these creatures
to man, that they have no fear.


EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Chuck, John and Rick snorkel among the playful SEA LIONS.
They dart and swim like otters among their new human
friends.


EXT.  LAVA OUTCROPPING - DAY

Terry, Chris, Chuck and Mike stand taking notes on exotic
birds.  Frigates, hawks, flamingos, pelicans, boobies, and
of course... albatrosses.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY

The crew are sprawled across the deck taking final exams.
Alice walks among them.  Chuck throws an anxious look
towards John who is buried in his test.


EXT.  GRASSY LOWLANDS - DAY

Boobies nest in the grass.  Thousands of them and
amazingly, the crew can walk among them without them
batting an eye.  Chuck and Robin watch as the iguanas
sneak into unattended nests and steal eggs.


EXT.  DUNES - DAY

Chuck is alone gazing over the shoreline.  A huge flock of
finches darken the sky, circling the black sand beach.
Pure magic.


EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Beyond, the anchored Albatross rocks and bounces in a
blue-sky gale.  Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod
stand by a dory watching the sea build.  They wear only
tattered shorts, their hair sun bleached and their skin
dark.

                         RICK
          We're here for the night.

                         TOD
          Yeah.


EXT.  ROCKS - SAME

Tight.  The eyes of predators.  Sharp, cunning, hungry.


EXT.  BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY

A lone wild goat grazes on the beach.  It looks up,
sensing something, unfamiliar, then, returns to it's
grazing.

Tight.  Thundering bare feet on the black sand.

The goat looks up again, this time it sees five
Homosapiens bearing down on him.  They come naked,
swinging their shredded clothing above their heads like
lassos.  Shouting, whooping, primal.  The goat bolts for
its life.

Pounding through the waterline like the wild horses of
Sable, the hunters charge after the hunted, closing.  The
goat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known.

The beach is broad and long with no cover.  The hunters
are gaining on the goat.  Splashing feet pound closer...

Suddenly they are upon the goat.  But, instead of
attacking it, they just run through it, passing it.  The
goat pulls up and stops, breathless, watching the naked
humans run.

Close on the faces of brothers, matching each other, step
for step.  The music builds as we...

FREEZE FRAME


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Wild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man.
The rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting.
The heaping of driftwood into piles.  Taught and powerful,
the glistening bodies of young men.

Blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone.  A
flame is born.  Voices howl in guttural triumph.

As the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of
men pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance.

The goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance
builds to a frenzy.  The night sky is filled with the
building sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting
voices.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME

The wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water.
The flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning
the white hull of the ship, a deep flickering orange.  The
word A-L-B-A-T-R-O-S-S has been spelled in huge flaming
letters.  Alice joins Skipper at his place by the rail
watching.

                         ALICE
          What are they doing?

                         SKIPPER
          Claiming their place in the world.


EXT.  SHORELINE - DAWN

The white surf hisses as it washes among the cinders of
the evenings ritual.  The Galapagos have been returned,
for now, to the frigates and the iguanas.

Across the water against the rising sun, the Albatross,
under full sail, is bound for home.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

The crew stand at their posts.  The yards and foretop are
trimmed with sailors, their faces taught and their bodies
hard.  No one looks back.


EXT.  DECK - PANAMA CANAL - DAY

Alice steps onto the deck from the chart house with papers
in her hands.

                         ALICE
          Well gentlemen, I have the results
          of your college board scores.  I
          think most of you will be pleased.

The crew members collect their exams.  Chuck notices John
at the bow, alone, lost.

                         CHUCK
          You okay?

                         JOHN
          Yeah.  How'd you do.

Chuck looks down at his exam apprehensively.

                         CHUCK
          Ninety-six.

                         JOHN
          Congratulations.

                         CHUCK
          What about you?

John slowly passes his test to Chuck.

                         CHUCK
          It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!

                         JOHN
          I know.

                         CHUCK
                  (excited)
          You know?  Then why are you up here
          looking like you're about to jump
          overboard?!

                         JOHN
          I just can't believe it.

                         CHUCK
          This is your moment, don't you see?
          The instant when you know that your
          life is never going to be the same
          again.  When you stand up and are
          counted.

John tries to choke back his emotions.

                         JOHN
          I couldn't have done it without you.

                         CHUCK
          Yes you could.  You did.
                  (holding up the
                   exam)
          This is all you.  Nobody else.

John looks out.

                         JOHN
          Thank you.

Chuck smiles and joins John's gaze over the water.

                         CHUCK
          Feels different doesn't it?

                         JOHN
          What?

                         CHUCK
          That we're going back.  I don't want
          it to end.  I don't want to be what
          I was when I left.

                         JOHN
          What was that?

                         CHUCK
          Anonymous.

Chuck looks at his test grimacing.

                         CHUCK
          I've been getting ninety-sixes my
          whole life.  It's what they expect.
          After all this, I still haven't
          figured it out.

                         JOHN
          Figured what out?

                         CHUCK
          Who I am, outside of this boat.
          What the hell I'm doing here.

                         JOHN
          I'll tell you who you are.  You're
          the glue.  You're the thing that
          holds everybody around you together.
          You're strong, you listen and you
          see things in people the rest of us
          can't.  It's a gift.

It's Chuck's turn to fight emotion.

                         CHUCK
          You know, I never had friends like
          this.

                         JOHN
          Me either.

                         CHUCK
          I feel like... we can do anything.

John smiles, clutching his exam.

                         JOHN
          We can.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          In the fading hours of that Pacific
          dusk, with nothing left to confess,
          for the first time we felt safe,
          capable, sure of who we were and
          where we were going.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAWN

The crew sleep in their bunks.  Lawford's voice rumbles
down the companionway.

                         LAWFORD
          A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A
          wind that follows fast, And fills
          the white and rushing sail, And
          bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise
          you salty dogs.  The watch is on.

Chuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out.  The dumb waiter
clatters down from the galley with the morning's
breakfast.  Skipper and some of the crew are already
eating.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The Albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage
of what little wind there is.  The skies are gray and
dank.  Tod and Terry are at the helm.  Chuck and John are
amid ship.  John relieves Bill on the forward watch.

                         CHUCK
          Looks like we're gonna get wet.

                         BILL
          Well, we need it.  I want to take a
          nice long bath and catch some water
          for my laundry.

                         JOHN
          Save some for me will you?

                         BILL
          You got it.  I'm going below.

Suddenly, a huge lightning bolt explodes out of the sky
and strikes the water a hundred feet off of the starboard
beam.  Everyone jumps.

                         TOD
          Jesus!!

Skipper bolts onto the deck.

                         SKIPPER
          Everybody okay?

The crew nod sheepishly.  A very close call.

                         SKIPPER
          All hands keep out of the rigging
          and stay clear of the masts.

The clouds grow dark but no more lighting.  Tod laughs
nervously.  Everybody joins in.  It's contagious.  Even
Skipper manages a smile.

                         SKIPPER
          All right gentlemen.  Thor's had his
          fun.  Let's keep a keen eye.

Skipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly, a
powerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree
list to the starboard.  Skipper stops and turns.

Instinctively, John and Chuck spring for the rigging to
drop sail.

                         SKIPPER
                  (sharply)
          No!  Stay down!!

Skipper stares at the sky with the intensity of a cobra.
Waiting.  The wind eases.  It becomes eerily still.  The
ship slows and the sails go slack.  Silence.  Skipper
maintains his vigil.

CLOSE ON WATER

Foam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like
the invisible footprint of a locomotive.  John sees it
first.

                         JOHN
                  (shouting)
          HERE IT COMES!!!

Everybody turns and looks.  Skipper's eyes suddenly widen
as he realizes...

                         SKIPPER
                  (in a whisper)
          White Squall!

The charging wall of wind slams into the topsails so hard
it send a shudder throughout the ship.  The wheel is
nearly ripped out of Tod's hands.  Instinctively, he tries
to turn the ship into the wind.

                         SKIPPER
          Hard to starboard!!!  Hard to
          starboard!!!

Confused, panicked, Tod keeps turning to the left, into
the wind.  Skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when
the ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the
deck.

                         TOD
          No, hard to port!

                         SKIPPER
          TURN THE GOD DAMNED WHEEL TO THE
          RIGHT!!!

Finally, Tod does as he is told.  But as soon as the ship
starts to come about, the vicious wind drives her further
onto her side.  As the deck becomes vertical Chuck half
slips, half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Robin, Chris, Bill, Mike and Rick are seated at the table
finishing breakfast as the ship starts to go.  They all
share growing alarm as they watch the table reach it's
maximum angle.  Dishes start sliding off.

                         BILL
          Get out!!  Everybody out!!


EXT.  DECK - SAME

Skipper manages to grab the ax mounted on the chart house
and cuts the mainsheet with a single blow.  But it's too
late.  The tall masts plunge into the ocean and the sails
scoop tons of sea water, pinning the Albatross on her
side.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME

Alice struggles towards the door.  The book case tears out
of the wall and strikes her.  She drops to her knees.  The
door swings open in front of her.  She reels for a moment
and then loses consciousness.


INT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME

Lawford, Charlie and George are all hurled out of their
bunks.  The world is suddenly sideways.  Lawford leaps up,
pushing the others towards the companionway ladder.

                         LAWFORD
          GO, GO, GO!!!  TOPSIDE!!!  Come on
          Charlie!  George, get them out!!

George disappears into the main cabin.  Lawford manages to
get Charlie out.  As Lawford reaches the top of the ladder
sea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back
into the bowels of the ship.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Robin is through the companionway in the chart house with
Mike right behind him.  But instead of exiting, he holds
the door open against the sea so that Mike can escape.

Mike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it
closed, pinning Robin's arm.  He struggles to push
through.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

John slashes at the lines securing the starboard lifeboat
with his knife and manages to free it before it is dragged
to the bottom.  He scrambles through the collapsed rigging
tangled above him for the port lifeboat.

AT THE STERN

The Albatross is going down.  Fast.  Chuck and Tod stand
on the after skylight.  Chuck catches glimpses of the
struggle going on below.

                         CHUCK
          My God, they're drowning!

Skipper catches a glimpse of Alice through the skylight.
Water washes over her but she doesn't move.

                         SKIPPER
          Oh please, no.  Not this woman.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME

Skipper's face is pressed hard against the skylight.  His
muffled voice penetrates the cabin.  Alice stirs.  She
looks around, delirious.

                         SKIPPER
          Alice, get up!!  Come on girl!!

He pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the
planks, fingers bleeding.  Alice looks up confused but
calm and finds Skipper's eyes.

ON THE DECK

Panicked for the first time in his life Slipper swings the
ax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of
splinters into the water.

                         SKIPPER
          Get out!!  Get out!!  Jesus Christ,
          please God, Alice get out!!!

But after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip
beneath the sea.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Water thunders in from every possible exit.  Chris and
Rick push Bill towards the dumbwaiter.   

                         RICK
          Bill, you go.  We'll be right behind
          you.

Before he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the
tiny shaft.  Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser
smashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious.  But the
pressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the
galley and out onto the deck.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

Skipper struggles to reach John and the second life boat
but sees that it is tangled in the rigging.

                         SKIPPER
          Johnny, it's not good.

John defies him and keeps cutting.  The ship is almost
completely submerged.

                         JOHN
          I can get it!

Suddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges
into the water taking lines and rope with it.  John
becomes tangled and is dragged into the water.  Only his
superior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and
keep cutting.

The Albatross slips beneath the surface.  Instead of
trying to free himself John keeps slashing at the lifeboat
lines as he disappears, swallowed by the sea.


INT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME

Eerie silence.  Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket.
Debris float around.  He begins to panic as the water
around him rises.

                         LAWFORD
          My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!!

He takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.  Then
suddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure
within.

ON THE SURFACE

Lawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the
surface.


EXT.  SURFACE - SAME

Chuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house
door as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'.  Suddenly the ship
rolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting up
like a huge dorsal fin.


EXT.  UNDERWATER - SAME

Chuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still
finds Robin's arm.  They clasp tightly, but Chuck just
can't budge the door.  Then, strangely, Robin releases
Chuck's arm and pulls it back through the door.  Chuck
looks up, startled.  The small round window in the door is
illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside.

Through the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes.
He fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket.  Robin takes
a last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him.

He meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange
acceptance.  They both know what's happening.  But Robin
has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him.  He
presses his hand to the glass.  Chuck does the same.  Then
with a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door,
disappearing into the darkness and eternity.


EXT.  SURFACE - SAME

Chuck breaks the surface, gasping for air.  He looks
around, frantic.  He sees nothing but the sea swells and
debris.  All that remains is the sound of the wind and
rain on the water.

Suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of
foam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water
like shattered lances as the ship rights herself
underwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as if
in a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins
to rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire length
explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.

ON THE DECK

Like Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of
tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long
boat.

And for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as
if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea.  Some
of the boys begin to cheer prematurely.  But Skipper knows
better.  She's filled to the gills with sea water.

She shutters.  Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked
to the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing,
as she finally goes.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Survivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the
watery tempest.  Strangely, the wind subsides.  The sea
becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the
water.

                         CHUCK
          OH GOD!!!!!

His scream echoes, for the grief of all.

ON THE SURFACE

There is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips
beneath the waves like a stone.  The stunned crew can only
watch.

Then, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the
surface.

Skipper fights off his emotions.  He knows what it means.
John died cutting it free.

Terry and Bill hang onto a life ring.  Blood runs from
Bill's head.  Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto
the side of the other freed life boat which has been
swamped.  Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but
alive.  Several of the boys help pull him towards the
boat.

Skipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for
those not accounted for.  But, they are gone.

Among the wreckage, the roof of the chart house.  The only
sound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell,
Robin's bell, still secure in it's fitting.


EXT.  LIFE BOAT - DAY

The boats have been floated and tied together.  Skipper is
in one, Lawford in the other.  One of the two boats has
been rigged with sail.  Skipper stands in the bow staring
into the ink blue water.

                         SKIPPER
          Raise your sail, Bill.  North, north-
          east.  Keep a sharp look out for
          Florida.

Bill studies him for a moment, then...

                         BILL
          Maybe we could wait around a little
          longer, sir...

There is a long pause before Skipper answers.

                         SKIPPER
                  (quietly)
          She's gone... She's gone.

There is something remarkably touching about this young
man trying to take care of him.  He puts a hand on
Skipper's shoulder.  It almost makes him crack.  He pats
Bill's hand gently.

                         SKIPPER
          Carry on.

                         BILL
          Yes sir.

                         SKIPPER
          North, north-east.
                  (beat)
          And Dick, please make a note of our
          final position.

Lawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floating
wreckage around them, silent, lost.

Suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  The
survivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again.

Chuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It's
suddenly alive... With sharks.

                         LAWFORD
          Hands and feet inside the boats.

They come by the dozens.  Ramming the boats and rummaging
through the debris.  They swarm around the boats until it
seems as if the water is boiling.  Chuck picks up an oar
and starts beating wildly at the sharks.

                         CHUCK
          AAAAHHHH!!!!

The others take up the cause and in a moment they are all
screaming and cursing the sharks.  It's a frenzy of grief
and anger.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          We slashed at the sharks as if
          striking out at the finger of God.
          And we all begged silently for the
          ability to understand what had
          happened.  But, if there was a God
          that day, his answer came only in
          the moaning wind and our questions
          were left to drift unanswered, in
          the titanic ocean of our deepest
          grief.

Exhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost.

                         CHUCK
                  (hushed)
          Wake up.  Wake up.  1-2-3 wake up.

Like Robin's nightmare of his brother, this is all too
real.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The tramp freighter GRAN RIO steams toward the life boats.
The crew stand silently, watching as the ship approaches.


EXT.  SHIP - DAY

Chuck stands on the deck of the Gran Rio as the last of
the crew scramble up cargo netting hung over the side.
Chuck stares out numbly watching as the two deserted long
boats drift away.


EXT.  DECK - GRAN RIO - DAY

Chuck, now dressed, stands in the same spot at the rail,
staring out.  A muffled sound pulls Chuck into the
present.  He walks slowly down the after deck to a cabin
door where sobbing escapes from the other side.  Chuck
turns the handle and cracks the door.


INT.  CABIN - SAME

Curled up on the floor next to his bunk is Skipper.  A
look of shock comes over Chuck's face.  Skipper has come
completely unglued, sobbing deeply.

                         CHUCK
                  (tentative)
          Skipper?

Skipper turns slowly, looking up.  His eyes are red and
his face streaked with tears.  He looks at Chuck almost as
if he doesn't know who he is.  Lost.

                         SKIPPER
          I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.

Chuck reels.  It sounds more like a confession than an
outpouring of sadness.  Chuck closes the door.


EXT.  HARBOR - TAMPA FLORIDA - DAY

Skipper, back in control, and the crew, stand along the
port rail of the Gran Rio.  A small flotilla of pleasure
boats surround the ship and hundreds of people line the
pier.  It's an intimidating sight.

ON THE PIER

Pensive, worried, angry faces of parents and families.
Chaos.  Coast Guard Officials try to hold back the mob.

                         MAN
          What about the manifest!!  What
          about my son!!!

                         WOMAN
          How many made it?  Nobody will tell
          us anything!!

                         OFFICER
          We don't have a list of survivors
          yet.  Please stand back.  Don't
          push!

Angry shouts drown him out.

ON THE DECK

The CAPTAIN of the Gran Rio comes down from the bridge
with some of his officers and stand with Skipper and the
others.  Several COAST GUARD OFFICERS join them on the
deck.

Skipper turns to the Captain and extends his hand.

                         SKIPPER
          Thank you.

The Captain nods.  Skipper turns to his crew, looking over
them.  A smile of deep pride passes his lips.  They all
see it.  Then, between the Coast Guard Officers, he walks
down the ramp.  Lawford and the crew fall in behind.


EXT.  PIER - SAME

A shouting mob waits for them.  Reporters and spectators
shout and call out questions.  It reaches a fever pitch as
the crew descend.  Skipper reaches the bottom of the ramp,
his eyes meet a cool, familiar face.  Francis Boutillier.
Phil stands next to him, staring at the ground.

                         FRANCIS
                  (above the shouting)
          Welcome home.

Skipper is shoved forward by the crowd pushing and
shoving.  The crew follow but are swept away.  Charlie
stops in front of Phil.

                         CHARLIE
          Phil?

Flash bulbs explode.  Charlie and the others are descended
upon as reporters bark out questions.

                         REPORTER #1
                  (shouting)
          What the hell happened out there
          captain?

                         REPORTER #2
          How many boys did you lose...?  And
          how come you didn't go down with
          your ship?

Parents begin to realize who has been lost.  Agonizing
cries mix with jubilation.  It's emotional chaos.  The
crew members are driven apart, they call to each other,
suddenly aware of what's happening.

                         TOD
                  (panicked)
          Charlie!!  Bill!!

Terry suddenly finds himself smothered in the arms of his
MOTHER.  He strains to see what is happening to his
shipmates.

                         TERRY'S MOTHER
          Oh, sweetheart!  Look at you...

                         TERRY
          Skipper!!

Reporters corner them blocking his view.  More reporters
clamor after Skipper, who doesn't reply.

                         REPORTER #3
          Captain, is it true that the ship was
          hit by a "White Squall"?

                         REPORTER #2
          Is it true the first mate is only
          fifteen?

Bill steps in between them.

                         BILL
          It wasn't his fault mister...

                         REPORTER #4
          The National Weather Service says
          "White Squalls" are a meteorological
          phenomenon of the imagination.
          Would you care to comment of that?
          Don't you have anything to say to
          these parents?!!

The reporter pops a flash picture in Skipper's face.
Skipper flies around and knocks the camera to the ground.
The reporter jumps back, startled.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes I do.  And it's private.  Very
          private.

Skipper is swept away towards the CUSTOMS BOOTH by COAST
GUARD OFFICERS.  Skipper surrenders the manifest and it is
stapled to the outside of the door.


INT.  CUSTOMS HUT - SAME

Skipper is whisked inside.  The Coast Guard Officers lock
the doors behind them.

                         OFFICER
          Sit down Captain.  We'll have a car
          here in a few minutes.  Can I get
          you a cup of coffee?

                         SKIPPER
          No, thank you.

Skipper sits.  The wails of family members can be heard as
they see the list outside.  Flash bulbs and faces press
against the windows shouting questions.  He just stares at
the floor.

OUTSIDE

From above we can see the group swarm around the the booth
like angry hornets.  The crew are fractured and pulled
apart from each other.  Charles, fights his way through
the crowd.

                         CHARLES
          Chuck!  Chuck!!!

Chuck tries to get to him.

                         CHUCK
          Dad!

They embrace.  Flash bulbs explode all around them.

                         CHUCK
          Where's Mom?

                         CHARLES
          I couldn't bring her down here until
          I knew you were safe.

A WOMAN

Stands, staring at the empty ramp.  Lost.  A man comes up
behind her and leads her away.

A reporter shoves a microphone in Chuck's face.

                         REPORTER #5
          Was it the Skipper's fault?  And is
          it true drinking was permitted on
          board?  Why did the ship really go
          down?

Charles grabs the guy and shoves him back into the crowd.
Chuck strains to see his crew mates but they have been
swept away.

                         CHARLES
          Come on.

Charles puts his arm around Chuck, still barefoot, and
together, they walk away.  Photographers trail after them,
popping off a few last photos.  Chuck turns and looks
back.


INT.  CAR MOVING - DOWNTOWN - DAY

A ride reminiscent of the one Chuck and his father took
before the journey began.  There is a gulf of silence
between them.  Charles breaks it.

                         CHARLES
          I thought we'd find a store, get you
          fixed up and then get you some
          lunch.  That sound good?

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, sure.

Chuck stares out the window at the traffic and congestion.
A car in front of them runs a red light.  Charles slams on
the brakes.  Chuck is shaken up.  Charles notices.

                         CHARLES
          I'm sorry, son.  Are you okay?

Chuck manages a nod.


INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Lavish and conspicuous by Chuck's recent standards, the
store is crowded and jammed with merchandise.
Claustrophobic.  Cash registers ring and MUZAK drifts in
from above.  Chuck follows as Charles pulls things off of
hangers and piles them into Chuck's arms.

                         CHARLES
          Why don't you go and try some of
          that on?

                         CHUCK
          Okay.


EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Charles peruses the racks.  He calls to Chuck.

                         CHARLES
          How're you doing in there?

Chuck calls from a dressing room.

                         CHUCK (O.S.)
          Fine.

                         CHARLES
          All right.  I'm gonna wander over
          and look at some shoes...


INT.  DRESSING ROOM - SAME

Chuck is curled up in the floor of the tiny booth.  Still
dressed in the clothes from the Gran Rio, perspiration
beads on his skin.

                         CHUCK
                  (calling out)
          Okay.

Tears stream down his face.  He looks up and sees himself
in the mirror.  The eyes that look back are eyes of the
ages.  Involuntary sobs.  He begins to shake.  The tiny
booth suddenly like a crypt.  Tight, with no air.  Chuck
lets out a gasp.

                         CHUCK
          Oh God...

Someone pulls open the curtain.  A MAN, from the next
booth, fat and middle aged stands before Chuck in a pair
of pants still sporting the price tags.  He looks down.

                         MAN
          You okay, kid?

Chuck is suddenly in the throws of a full-on anxiety
attack.  He leaps up and pushes past the man.


EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - SAME

Chuck explodes out of the dressing room.  Running, almost
blind, he crashes into a rack of clothes.  Charles looks
up as he scrambles to his feet and bolts for the doors.

                         CHARLES
          Chuck!!


EXT.  STREET - SAME

Charles bursts through the doors, looking up and down the
street, but Chuck is... gone.


EXT.  BEACH - SAME

The setting sun paints Chuck's face with golden light.  He
stares out across the water.  Charles walks up behind him.

                         CHUCK
          When we were growing up I always
          felt like you would take care of
          things, that everything would be
          okay.
                  (beat)
          But you can't make this okay, can
          you?

                         CHARLES
          No, I can't.

Charles puts his arm around his son.  Together they turn
and walk back towards the boardwalk, and the world.


INT.  COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Skipper sits across from a Coast Guard Officer, TYLER, 60.
Tyler pulls out a file and lays it on the table.

                         TYLER
          There are allegations questioning
          your competence with regard to the
          command of the Albatross.  I have
          been instructed to convene a formal
          tribunal to determine whether or not
          negligence played a part in the
          sinking.

                         SKIPPER
          I understand.

                         TYLER
          May I ask you something?

Skipper nods.

                         TYLER
          How'd you manage to piss off a guy
          as powerful as Francis Boutillier?

                         SKIPPER
          It wasn't hard.

                         TYLER
          I used to helm a school ship.  A
          long time ago.

                         SKIPPER
          The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never
          lost a race while you were Skipper.

Tyler is taken aback by Skipper's knowledge.

                         TYLER
          That's right, we didn't.  I miss it
          sometimes.  But, there are other
          things a Skipper can do.

Tyler removes his glasses and studies Skipper.

                         TYLER
          The families... want your ticket.
          Turn it in, we forget the whole
          thing.  Everybody goes home.

                         SKIPPER
          ... Absolutely not.

                         TYLER
          The papers are going to eat you
          alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll
          never get another commission.
                  (beat)
          They want someone to be accountable.

                         SKIPPER
          I am accountable.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Standard fare.  Two beds and a T.V.  Chuck's lacing a new
pair of sneakers.  Charles is in the shower.  There is a
knock at the door.  Chuck cracks the door.  It's Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
          We gotta talk.


INT.  BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

The crew stand by the bulkhead.  Bill tosses down a
newspaper.  The headline reads:  INVESTIGATION TO PROBE
SCHOOL SHIP TRAGEDY.

                         BILL
          We're all going to have to testify.
          They're going to try to take his
          license.

                         TOM
          Why?

                         CHUCK
          They need it to be simple.  They
          need a reason.

                         TOM
          Who?

                         CHUCK
          All of them.  Everybody waiting on
          that dock.

                         TIM
          So what are we supposed to do?

                         TOD
          Just tell 'em what we know and be
          done with it.  That's what he'd
          want.

                         TERRY
          Easy for you to say.

                         TOD
          What's that supposed to mean?!

                         TERRY
          Everybody knows why she went over
          Tod.  You jibed the boat.

                         TOD
          I was trying to get her up wind!
          That's what you do when you're hit
          a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid
          to know that!

                         TERRY
          That's not what Skipper thought.  He
          was trying to spill air from the
          main!

                         BILL
          It was coming four points off the
          bow, Terry.  He never could have
          gotten her around.

                         TERRY
          Were you on deck?  I was standing
          right there and all I know is, he...
                  (indicates Tod)
          ... disobeyed an order, twice, and
          the boat went over.

                         TOD
          It didn't go over 'til I turned her
          starboard!

                         BILL
          It was an act of God for Christ's
          sake.

                         TERRY
          It was an act of stupidity.

Tod lunges at Terry.  Bill and Charlie pull them apart.

                         TOD
                  (screaming)
          Was it my fault we were running all
          that sail?!  Was it my fault she
          wasn't dogged down?!!  HUH?!!  I
          couldn't help that the ballast
          shifted...!  You son of a bitch!!
          It wasn't my fault!!  it wasn't.

Tod breaks down, sodding on his knees.

                         BILL
          It's okay, Tod.

Terry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt.

                         TERRY
          Then whose?

Tod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused.

                         TERRY
          After the lightning strike, we tried
          to go aloft to drop sail.  We'd done
          it a thousand times.  We didn't have
          to wait for an order.  But Skipper
          called us down.

                         CHARLIE
          If the foremast had taken a strike,
          everyone in the rigging would've
          been fried.  What would you have
          done?

                         TERRY
          We would have scalloped the squares
          from the deck.  Right Bill?

Bill turns and stares into the water, troubled.

                         TOD
          That's right, that's right!  Bleed
          the sails from the deck and she
          could've taken a hurricane!

It's a strong argument.  Even Charlie is troubled by the
implication.  There is a long moment of silence between
them.

                         CHUCK
          This is crazy.  Nothing could have
          prevented what happened.

                         MIKE
          You guys are missing the point.
          This is all because of Phil.  Phil
          and his dear old dad.

                         BILL
          What?

                         MIKE
          How do you think they got this
          together so fast?  He's been laying
          for Skipper since the first day.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on.  Like he's got a vendetta
          or some such shit?

                         MIKE
          You got it.
                  (to Chuck)
          I told you he was a turn coat the
          day we kicked him off the boat.

Chuck frowns, troubled.

                         CHUCK
          No.  You're wrong.

                         MIKE
          I'm telling you, the only way to
          change this is to get Phil to call
          off his old man.  And that ain't
          gonna happen.  So the way I see it,
          it's Skipper or us.

The guys react.  It's a no win situation.


EXT.  MOTEL - NIGHT

Chuck knocks quietly on the door.  Phil answers the door.

                         CHUCK
          Can we talk?

                         PHIL
          I guess.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Who is it Philip?

                         PHIL
          It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.
                  (to Chuck)
          Look, what do you want?

                         CHUCK
          Everybody's saying this whole
          tribunal is happening because of
          your father.  Because of you.

                         PHIL
          Well that's just typical isn't it?

                         CHUCK
          Is it true Phil?

                         PHIL
          I gotta go.

                         CHUCK
          You weren't there, you don't know
          what happened.

                         PHIL
                  (defensive)
          I know enough.

Chuck puts a hand out to stop him.

                         CHUCK
          Phil, please.  It won't change
          anything.  Tell him to call it off.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Who are you talking to out there
          Philip.  Come back in here.

Phil meets Chuck's eyes, then looks away.

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry.

He turns again and reaches for the door.

                         CHUCK
          Wait.

Chuck hands him something.  Phil looks down, disbelieving.
It's the ship's bell.  Robin's bell.  Their symbol of
unity, of putting loyalty above fear.

                         CHUCK
          We figured he'd have wanted you to
          have it.
                  (beat)
          You do what you've gotta do Phil.

He leaves Phil standing alone on the porch, full of
emotion, trying to grasp it all.


INT.  HEARING ROOM - DAY

A small courtroom.  The room is filled with the crew
members and their families, including the parents of the
victims, as well as the media.  Phil sits with his father
and dodges Chuck's eyes.  Coast Guard Officers Tyler,
DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings.

                         TYLER
          The United States Coast Guard has
          been asked to conduct this maritime
          hearing to consider the revocation
          of Captain Richard Sheldrake's U.S.
          Master Seaman's Certificate.


INT.  HEARING ROOM - LATER

Bill sits at the table with his parents as questions are
leveled at him.  Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing
ask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the
proceedings.

                         SANDERS
          Why didn't you drop any sail?

                         BILL
          Skipper called us out of the
          rigging.

                         SANDERS
          But your instinct was to lose sail?

                         BILL
          My instinct was to not get
          electrocuted.

                         SANDERS
          How old are you, son?

                         BILL
                  (hesitating)
          Fifteen.

                         SANDERS
          Thank you.

LATER

Phil is at the table with Francis.  Sanders asks the
questions.

                         SANDERS
          Philip, why were you discharged from
          the Albatross?

Phil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers.

                         PHIL
          Skipper thought I was a challenge to
          authority.

                         SANDERS
          Were you?

                         PHIL
          I don't know.

LATER

                         FRANCIS
          Captain Sheldrake exhibited an
          arrogant, controlling attitude in my
          presence on more than one occasion.
          I believe he had a personality
          conflict with my son from the start.

                         SANDERS
          Well, if you don't mind my asking,
          sir, why did you let your son stay?

Francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly.

                         FRANCIS
          It was his dream to go.  I could
          hardly stand in the way of that,
          could I?

Phil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode.


INT.  HEARING ROOM - LATER

It is Skipper's turn at the table.

                         SANDERS
          Is it true that you forced Robin
          Weathers to climb the mast when it
          was clear that he was acrophobic.

                         SKIPPER
          He climbed when he was ready.

                         SANDERS
          Were you aware that his brother was
          killed in a fall.

Chuck and the others look up astonished.  Mike shoots a
look towards Phil.

                         MIKE
          He did it man.  He sang like a bird.

Skipper hesitates.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes, I was.

Whispers fill the room.

                         SANDERS
          Sir, were you aware at any time of
          the use of alcohol among the crew.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes, I was.

                         TYLER
          And you didn't do anything about it?

                         SKIPPER
                  (beat)
          No.  I didn't.

Again the crew members are struck.  Charlie turns to
Chuck.

                         CHARLIE
          They're twisting it all around.  Why
          doesn't he say something?

                         SANDERS
          Had you ever seen a "White Squall"
          before this incident?

                         SKIPPER
          No.

                         SANDERS
          What makes you so sure it was one?

                         SKIPPER
          I can't be sure.

                         SANDERS
          You really felt that your crew were
          up for the conditions.

                         SKIPPER
          We'd come twelve thousand miles
          together, through every kind of seas
          imaginable...

                         SANDERS
          Except, a "White Squall".
                  (beat)
          With all due respect Captain
          Sheldrake, they're only boys...

                         SKIPPER
          They are much more than that, sir.

                         SANDERS
          Is it true that the reason you
          expelled Philip Boutillier...

                         SKIPPER
                  (cutting him off)
          For killing a dolphin.

                         SANDERS
          ... and that you invited him to
          strike you?  To fight it out on the
          deck of your ship?!

Skipper looks over at Francis.  Phil stares at the floor.
Skipper manages an ironic smile.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes, that's true.

                         SANDERS
          Do you think this is funny?  Some
          kind of joke?  You lost six people
          out there.

                         SKIPPER
                  (white hot)
          I don't think one second of this is
          funny, sir.

Skipper stares down Sanders.  He turns to Tyler.

                         SANDERS
          I have no more questions at this
          time.

He turns to sit down, then stops.

                         SANDERS
          Oh, one last thing... Isn't true
          that your father was a sea Captain?

Skipper bristles.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes.

                         SANDERS
          Isn't also true that his vessel went
          down off of Nantucket?  Lost
          everyone on board.  In fair weather
          no less.

Skipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage.  Tyler
sees it and tries to intercept.

                         TYLER
          What does this have to do with
          anything Mr. Sanders?

                         SANDERS
                  (smug)
          Oh, nothing.  I was just curious.

                         SKIPPER
          My father, was more seaman, more of
          a man, than you might ever hope to
          be.

Sanders returns to his seat, rattled.  Tyler pounds his
gavel.

                         TYLER
          We'll take a brief recess.


EXT.  BUILDING - DAY

The crew huddle in the parking lot.  Fractured, confused.
Chuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves.

                         TOD
          There's still a way.

                         BILL
          What do you mean?

                         TOD
          It's me, don't you see.  Terry's
          right, I'm the escape hatch.  I
          disobeyed order.

                         CHUCK
          You taking the order wouldn't have
          changed anything.

                         TOD
          They don't know that.
                  (beat)
          We were the only one's on deck.
          Look, there's nothing they can do to
          me right?  I'm a kid.

                         CHUCK
          But that's not the point...

                         TOD
          That is the point... And Skipper'll
          slip off the hook.

LATER

Tod is on the stand.

                         DOWNING
          Why didn't you turn hard to port as
          the wind hit?

                         TOD
          I thought we'd have a better chance
          if I headed into the wind so we
          could spill air from our sails.

Tyler removes his glasses.

                         DOWNING
          But the Captain ordered you hard to
          starboard.

                         TOD
          Twice.

                         DOWNING
          Is that what you were trained to do?

                         TOD
          No.

                         DOWNING
          Then what do you think he was trying
          to do.

                         TOD
          Let the blow drive the boat down
          wind.  Neutralize our canvas.

Skipper is becoming uneasy.  He sees what is coming.

                         DOWNING
          So when the captain gave you an
          order contrary to your training, you
          thought he was making a mistake?

                         TOD
          No.

                         TYLER
          Then why son, why didn't you follow
          his order?

Tod meets Skipper's eyes.

                         TOD
          Because -- I panicked.

The room is suddenly buzzing.  Tod's Father stands up.

                         TOD'S FATHER
          That's not true Tod.

                         TERRY
                  (to Mike)
          What the hell?  What is he doing.

                         MIKE
          Son of a gun.  He just sent Skipper
          a life boat.

Tyler turns to Skipper.

                         TYLER
          If this young man had responded
          instantly to your command, do you
          believe the ship might have been
          spared?

                         SKIPPER
          I don't know that anything could
          have prevented what happened.

                         TYLER
          Then what are you trying to say
          then?

Skipper stands.

                         SKIPPER
          Maybe you can't see what's happening
          here, but it's clear to me.
                  (to Tod)
          I appreciate what you're trying to
          do Tod.  Maybe you could live with
          it, but I couldn't.
                  (to tribunal)
          If you think I'm going to let a
          sixteen year old take
          responsibility, then you
          underestimate me.  The Albatross was
          my ship.  The Ocean Academy was my
          school.  Her loss is mine and mine
          alone.
                  (to others)
          I can't bring your sons back.  If
          you want my ticket, if that will
          ease your loss, it's the least I
          can do.  This...

Skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.

                         SKIPPER
          This is easy.  Living with it,
          that'll be hard.

Skipper turns and lays his license down in front of Tyler.
Then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the
room.

The room erupts.  Crew members and their families hurl
accusations and blame.  Cameras flash.  Tyler tries to
regain control.  Suddenly Chuck stands, tall.

                         CHUCK
          No!!!  Don't you walk away!  Not
          now.  Not after all of this!!!!

Skipper keeps walking.  His head slumps.  Tyler pounds his
gavel.

                         TYLER
          That enough son!!  Order!!  Please!!

Tears begin to stream down Chuck's face.  His father,
Charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes.  Go for it.

                         CHUCK
          Tell me Skipper, was it all just a
          lie?  "Where we go one, we go all".
          We listened to you.  We believed it.
          And we're still here!!

Skipper keeps moving.

                         CHUCK
          Shame on you then Skipper.  Shame on
          you.

Skipper reaches for the door.  Suddenly a sound stops him
cold in his tracks.  Phil slowly rises.  Tears streaming
down his face.  Tightly in his hands he grips the ships
bell.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  It is the
ringing of the truth.  The tolling of their unity.

                         FRANCIS
          Sit down!

Phil ignores him.  Skipper slowly walks over, his eyes
never leaving Phil's.  He stops, facing him.  He gently
takes his hands and silences the bell.  Then he smiles and
puts a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his own
emotions.  He turns to Chuck.

                         CHUCK
          Tell them the truth.  Make them
          understand.

The room grows silent.

                         SKIPPER
                  (smiling)
          You tell them Chuck.

Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.

                         CHUCK
          It's simple.  Bad things happen
          sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or
          Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in
          this room.  Because we all knew the
          risks.
                  (to parents)
          You sent us... You paid our tuition,
          you allowed us to go.  So to invent
          a reason for why this happened, to
          pin it on one person, well that
          won't change anything.  It'll just
          make our experience meaningless.

He turns to the tribunal.

                         CHUCK
          If you want to judge this man, judge
          him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice
          and George.  Chris and John and
          Robin.  In one way or another each
          one of them gave their lives saving
          one of us.  This may sound crazy but
          the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or
          even a school.  It was something
          that we made, that's inside us.
          That's who Skipper is.  That's what
          he taught us.  I guess what it
          really was about was... the
          privilege of sacrifice.

Chuck turns to Skipper.

                         CHUCK
          Isn't that right?

Skipper nods.

                         SKIPPER
          That's right.

The room is silent.  Then, a voice.  A golden tenor
singing like the wind.  Everyone turns.  It's Bill.

                         BILL
          When the sun came up, there was
          whisky in the cup, and not a one of
          us was sober...

One by one the crew members stand and begin to sing.
Chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand
with him.  Words or not.

                         CREW TOGETHER
          Jenny thought she saw a picture when
          it really was the sun, then we knew
          the party was over.

They all stand facing Skipper and sing.  The voices build,
sweeping over everyone like a wave.

                         CREW TOGETHER
          Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you
          today, but I know we'll meet again,
          when the moon is in the valley and
          the leafs are on the trees, We will
          come to clearly in the glen...

Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates.  Only
now is his job finished.  He beams back.  The music swells
like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small
wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in
the calm waters beyond.

The crew come together around Skipper one last time.  They
embrace.


EXT.  MYSTIC SEAPORT - HARBOR - DAY

Older Chuck has returned to the small building where the
funeral services were held earlier.  The people have gone
but the funeral urn remains.


EXT.  PIER - DAY

Chuck walks to the dock.  He has the funeral urn in his
hands.  He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins
untying her.  The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out of
his office.

                         HARBOR MASTER
          What do you think you're doing.

He walks over to the dock.

                         HARBOR MASTER
          All right friend, out of the boat.

He tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the
sharp end of a gaffing hook.

                         OLDER CHUCK
                  (softly)
          Stand away.

He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means
business.  He backs off.  Chucks pushes away and raises
the sail.  The harbor master watches, perplexed as the
small boat moves off for open water.


EXT.  OPEN SEA - SUNSET

Bathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked
against the ivory sail.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          They didn't take his ticket that
          day.  But why he never returned to
          the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he
          hadn't been able to free himself
          from the anchor of grief that had
          driven him to his knees aboard the
          Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared
          for the solitude and isolation of
          command without his Alice.  Or maybe
          it was just that the waves that had
          spoken to him for so long, had grown
          silent.  Whatever it was, that
          thing, it had always troubled me.
          Because, fate offers up no reasons.
          And maybe that's what I have
          traveled these thirty four years to
          say.  Maybe that is all I really
          know... And, that one man cared.

Chuck turns to the sea and speaks.

                         OLDER CHUCK
          Rest easy old salt.  For together
          again, we'll sail.

With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at
the sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

The same sunset, but from another time.  Four young men
walk along a deserted beach.  A small boat has beached and
rocks gently in the shallows.  The boys run up and look at
it.  On the stern are painted the words:  BRIGANTINE
ALBATROSS.

SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water,
the young men and the boat.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Some time later we learned that one
          of our long boats had been
          recovered.  Several young men found
          it washed up on a nameless beach
          somewhere on the island of
          Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know
          who they were or where they came
          from, but they seemed to know of the
          Albatross.
                  (pause)
          Sometimes in my dreams those
          faceless young men reveal themselves
          as my lost companions, and on the
          twilight coral sands of forever,
          between my slumber and conscious
          state, we race naked again, so open
          and in love with those precious
          moments, running, ever laughing,
          ever young, ever free.

                                            SLAM CUT TO:

EXT.  GALAPAGOS - DUSK

Young again, their hair sun bleached and skins brown,
Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod, pound through the
surf in a grinning footrace.  Brothers all.  Music builds.

                         FADE IN:

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          ANGLE ON: BILLY MATTHEWS, 8, ravenously eating a plate
          of hashbrowns, runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
          Doug?...
          We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,
          staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that
          honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you
          move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns
          with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look
          and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then
          looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites
          and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          Doug?
          Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY
          MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile.

                         KELLY
          I've got some stuff to do for the party
          tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school?

                         DOUG
          What "stuff"? This party isn't going to
          be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a
          wing platter from Costco?

                         KELLY
          It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its
          going to be a nice party with nice food
          and nice music. And wings have carbs, so
          you can't eat them anyway.

                         BILLY

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          I'll eat 'em.
          Doug gives Billy a look.

                         DOUG
          No you won't. Because I'm going to
          scrape the batter off.

                         BILLY
          That doesn't work.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 2.

                         DOUG
          I went to medical school. You think I
          don't know how carbs work?

                         BILLY
          Dentists go to medical school?
          Doug looks a little insulted.

                         KELLY
          Doug, can you take Billy or not?

                         DOUG
          Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any
          emergencies at the office this morning.

                         KELLY
          You have emergencies?

                         DOUG

                         (INDIGNANT)
          Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my
          pager is for. one beep from that thing,
          and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah.
          Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up.

                         BILLY

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          The battery ith gone in that thing. You
          took them out for the TV clicker.
          Doug gives Billy a look.

                         DOUG
          I did do that. I forgot about that. I
          need to get some batteries in there.
          Because dentists do have emergencies. We
          are doctors, you know? We take the same
          oath. The oath of saving lives.
          Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms.
          Billy swats his hand away.

                         BILLY

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Uh uh. Carbth.
          Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the
          remaining lucky charms in the trash.

          INT. VOLVO - LATER THAT MORNING

          DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of
          Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger
          seat, looking bored. Doug notices.

                         DOUG
          You know, I use to race a car like this.
          Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw
          me coming.

                         BILLY
          Really?

                         DOUG
          Yup. It could really... smoke some ass.
          Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This
          was a good time to break the "no saying ass" rule.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Yes, sir. They called it the dragon
          wagon. You're lucky to be in here
          without a helmet, pal. We both are.
          Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars
          artificially. Billy is impressed.

                         BILLY
          Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio?

                         DOUG
          Heck yeah, you can jam the radio.
          Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.

           SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          The Volvo pulls up to a red light. Radio Disney blares
          "MICKEY LOVES MAMBO" from the stereo. BILLY bobs his
          head along with the music. DOUG looks out the window
          and sees a mid-twenties guy in a Porsche, staring at him.
          Doug nods hello, then awkwardly faces forward.

                         FADE OUT:

          INT. SMALL OFFICE - MORNING


           VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
          Bob?...
          BOB LEVENSTEIN, 40s, is working at his computer. Bob is
          good enough looking, but with a gawky wimpishness and
          burdened eyes. He tries to ignore the speakerphone.

          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE (CONT'D)
          Bob!?
          Bob cringes at the shrill, female voice.

                         BOB
          Hey, honey.

          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
          You need to come tell Haley she can't go
          to a party tonight.

                         BOB
          (into speaker phone)
          Well, I'm technically at the office right
          now, so...
          The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN,
          attractive and harsh-looking, steps in holding a phone.

                         KAREN
          Are you kidding me!? You work in our
          guest bedroom, not an office.

                         BOB
          I know, I was just trying to make this

                         DEADLINE--

                         KAREN
          Yeah, and I have to go to a job that
          actually makes us money, Bob. So, get
          out here and tell Haley she's not going
          anywhere!
          Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room.

          INT. BOB'S HOUSE / KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

          Bob enters the kitchen. His five year-old daughter,
          CLAIRE, wearing a dance leotard, walks up to him and
          smiles.

                         CLAIRE
          Hey, Daddy. Listen.
          (screams at the top of her

                         LUNGS)

                         EEEEEIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAA1
          Bob winces, and looks around for his other daughter.

          SFX: PHONE RINGS
          Bob reaches for it, but his other teenage daughter,
          HALEY, runs in, wearing a denim mini-skirt and Ugg boots.

                         HALEY
          No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien!
          Haley snatches the phone away from Bob.

                         BOB
          Actually, I need to talk to you--

                         HALEY

                         (IGNORING BOB)
          Hey, Julien. Yeah, totally. I'll
          probably just drop by and chill.

                         BOB
          If that's about the party, you--

                         HALEY
          Dad! I'm talking, here. God!
          Haley storms out of the room. Bob goes to say something,
          but CLAIRE enters and looks up at him.

                         CLAIRE

                         (SCREAMING AGAIN)
          Eeeeeeeiiiiiaaaaa!!
          Bob just stares at her, as Karen enters the Kitchen.

                         KAREN
          (yelling above Claire)
          Did you talk to her? Tell me you talked
          to her. God! I have to do everything!
          Just get Claire to ballet. She's late.

                         BOB
          Well, I really have to finish my--

                         KAREN
          Your little article for the "Web"
          magazine, Bob?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 6.

                         KAREN (CONT'D)
          I have a shareholder meeting. And we
          agreed that my career would be the
          priority, and you would work out of the
          house. You might not like it, but my job
          is higher paying. And I don't see you
          complaining about that hundred dollar
          shirt you're wearing.
          Bob looks down at his too-hip dress shirt.

                         BOB
          You bought this shirt for me. I was fine
          with my t-shirts--

                         KAREN
          Oh, you don't like the shirt now? Fine.
          Take it off.

                         BOB
          What?

                         KAREN
          Take it off! You don't want to wear nice
          things, don't. Off!
          Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it
          from him.

                         KAREN (CONT'D)
          Now take Claire to her ballet class.
          It's starts in five minutes.

                         BOB
          Well, I have to get another--

                         KAREN
          Go! Five minutes!
          Karen pushes Bob out the door, with Claire skipping
          happily behind him.

          INT. BOB'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER

          Bob sits in the car, SHIRTLESS, next to Claire. He looks
          over at her, and notices a pink hoodie in her lap.

                         BOB
          You going to wear that?

                         CLAIRE
          For five dollars, I'm not.
          Bob sighs and reaches for his wallet.

          INT. CHILDREN'S DANCE STUDIO - FIVE MINUTES LATER

          A bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class.
          Claire comes running into the group, as Bob enters behind
          her, wearing the pink hoodie. It's way too small, and
          doesn't quite cover his belly. He sits with the parents
          and nods awkwardly to them. It's embarrassing.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          FADE BACK IN ON:

          INT. MODERN HOUSE - MORNING

          We see the pristine living room of an expensive,
          architectural house.

          MALE VOICE (O.C.)
          Woody.

                         (GETTING ANGRY)
          Woody Stevens!
          We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes
          and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish
          house speaking into a cordless headset.

                         WOODY
          .No, you listen to me. You're not
          going to push me around. We agreed on a
          price, and that's the price I'll pay. If
          you don't like it, walk away... but you
          can kiss your business good bye, because
          that's what happens when you screw with
          Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard.
          As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a
          beautiful model, (CLAUDIA) as well as some pictures of
           his wedding day with her, their exotic vacations, and one
           blownup glamour shot of Woody, shirtless, oiled and
          holding a greasy wrench.

                          WOODY (CONT'D)
           .No, money's not the problem (LAUGHS)
          Money's never a problem. You just need
          to honor the correct price. Got it?
          Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset
          down on a stack of moving boxes. He marches to the front
          door and throws it open.

          EXT. WOODY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Woody yells out the front door.

                         WOODY
          .Then go home, Toby! You make me sick!
          ANGLE ON: The front yard. A ten-year-old boy is
          standing with a rake, surrounded by leaves. He clicks
          off his cellphone and shrugs.

                         TOBY
          I can't do this many leaves for ten
          bucks! It'll take two hours!

                         WOODY
          Well, you should have thought of that
          before you put the "any yard for ten
          bucks" flyer on the telephone pole.
          You're done on this block, now. And that
          goes for your band fund-raisers, too.
          I'm not buying any candy bars no matter
          what parade you dorks have to get to!
          Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of
          leaves, then starts home.

          INT. CLUTTERED OFFICE - MORNING

          We see an office crowded with disassembled Apple
          computers, motherboards, and abandoned monitors.

                         COMPUTER VOICE
          Dudley?
          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY FRANK (late 30s), an odd-looking, curly-
          haired guy with black plastic glasses that are slightly
          too big for his face. He stares at a computer in front
          of him.

                         DUDLEY
          Yeah, hey, Mac. How's it go--

          Thanks, Mac. Open internet, okay?
          A pause.

                         COMPUTER VOICE
          Command unknown.

                         DUDLEY
          Mac. Open. Internet.
          A pause.

          It is now nine o'clock am.

                         DUDLEY
          Alright, Mac. I'll show you.
          Dudley clicks a few keys and nods satisfactorily.

                         COMPUTER VOICE
          Internet open.
          Dudley laughs good-naturedly.

                         DUDLEY
          Right, because I just opened it.

                         (SIGHS)
          I guess I need to research alternative

                         COMPUTER VOICE
          Searching "alternative sex."

                         DUDLEY
          What? No!
          Dudley jumps forward and starts hitting the keys.

                         COMPUTER VOICE
          Two million websites found.

                         DUDLEY
          I didn't want to search that! I said

          Dudley frantically starts ripping the power wires out of
          the computer. The monitor goes dark. Dudley touches it
          sadly, then looks over at a cat sitting on the edge of
          the desk.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)

                         (TO CAT)
          Looks like it's still just you and me,
          icat.
          Dudley reaches out to pet the cat. It hisses at him
          angrily, and he quickly pulls his hand back.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

          INT. DOUG MATTHEW'S OFFICE - THAT AFTERNOON

          DOUG, now in his lab coat, sits at his desk, playing with
          a model of a mouth. The phone rings and Doug answers it.

                         DOUG

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hey, honey.
          INTERCUT WITH KELLY: On the phone at home.

                         KELLY
          You busy?

                         DOUG
          Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right
          here in front of me.
          Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic
          mouth.

                         KELLY
          Don't they mind you being on the phone?

                         DOUG
          Well, it's not attached to a head,
          really. More research.
          Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out.
          He fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere.

                         KELLY
          Oh. Well, I just wanted to tell you I
          found a great rate for the Ritz-Carlton
          tomorrow night. I Thought it might be
          romantic. Mom can stay here with Billy.

                         DOUG
          I don't know. Do you think we really
          need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy
          has his own room. Why don't we just buy
          new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones.
          It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have
          to pay to make phone calls!

                         KELLY

                         DOUG--

                         DOUG
          What? I'm just saying--
          Suddenly, the speaker comes on overhead.

          VOICE ON SPEAKER
          Dr. Matthews? Patient emergency in room
          eight.
          Doug snaps to attention.

                         DOUG
          Emergency?

                         (INTO PHONE)
          I've got to go! Emergency!
          Doug jumps out of his seat and scrambles over his desk
          and out the door.

          INT. DENTAL EXAM ROOM - A SECOND LATER

          Doug flies into an exam room, where a hygienist, DANA, is
          looking into a male patient's mouth.

                         DANA
          Doctor Matthews. Finally. Take a look
          at this.
          Doug looks in the man's mouth and nods.

                         DOUG
          Acute molar abscess. That's going to
          need emergency surgery.

                         DANA
          That's what I thought. Thank God you got
          here.

                         DOUG
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          Well, let's send him over to an
          Orthopedic surgeon.

                         DANA
          Absolutely. Thanks, doctor.
          Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but
          there's nothing. He moves a dental tool away from the
          edge of a tray, smiles politely and exits.

          EXT. DOUG'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          DOUG, looking depressed, pulls into the driveway. He
          looks over and sees BILLY and three of his friends
          shooting baskets. He smiles, gets out of the car and
          struts over.

                         DOUG

                         (TO KIDS)
          Yo! Matthews is open.
          Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the
          ball to DOUG. Doug dribbles it under his leg and charges
          the basket.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Taking it into the paint. Who's got the
          D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya!
          Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into
          the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying
          backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug
          notices.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Well, that's not really my shot. I
          usually hit from downtown, you know?
          Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back
          to the three point line.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          That's where the big games get won. Back
          here from the three--
          Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads
          towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it.
          It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his
          head, humiliated.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          That was a pass, dudes!
          It wasn't.
          Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there
          awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.

          INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

          DOUG enters and finds KELLY. She smiles and kisses him.

                         KELLY
          Hey, honey. Snack?
          Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over
          to the table, where Kelly has laid out Ritz crackers
          covered in cheez whiz, for the kids. Doug puts the bag
          of celery down.

                         DOUG
          I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go
          meet the guys for a beer.

                         KELLY

                          
          Okay. Lite beer, if you want to stick to
          that diet.

                         DOUG

                          
          Right. Yes. Lite beer. No carbs. Just
          delicious beer... water.
          Doug smiles and heads upstairs. Kelly looks concerned.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DOUG'S BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

          Doug enters his bedroom and shuts the door behind him.
          He sits down on the bed and lets out a long sigh.

          After a moment, he gets up and walks over to the closet.
          He opens it and we see: A leather biker jacket, leather
          chaps, boots, gloves, a black "half-helmet," etc. For
          the first time, we see a genuine smile come over Doug's
          face.

          EXT. DOUG'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          The garage door on Doug's house rolls open like a theater
          curtain, and Doug, wearing the full leather biker getup,
          idles out of the garage on a gleaming, chromed-out Harley
          Davidson Fatboy. He looks around the neighborhood
          cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides
          into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes
          to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large
          patch that reads "Wild Hogs." The camera ZOOMS IN ON
          THIS, and it becomes:

          MUSIC CUE CONTINUES OVER FOLLOWING SCENES:

          EXT. BOB LEVENSTEIN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          BOB creeps through the living room. From the kitchen, we
          can hear KAREN, HALEY and CLAIRE screaming things at him,
          about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and
          opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob
          smile the same way Doug did, and...

          SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. BOB'S DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER

          BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on
          another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around
          through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete
          bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding
          towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins
          alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap
          fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is
          also wearing a "Wild Hogs" jacket.

          EXT. WOODY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          WOODY walks through the courtyard, and into a pristine
          garage.

          He passes by a BMW 645, several stacks of labelled moving
          boxes, and finally a beautiful Harley Davidson Softail
          Anniversary Edition.
          A MINUTE LATER, Woody pulls onto the street on his
          Harley. DOUG and BOB turn the corner and nod to him.
          Woody nods back, revs his engine, and joins alongside
          them.

          EXT. DUDLEY'S COMPUTER-CLUTTERED GARAGE - SAME TIME

          We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple
          computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster.
          Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh
          with his thick-lensed eyeglasses.
          Dudley cockily pulls on a "Wild Hogs" jacket, kick starts
          the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door,
          and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets
          halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on
          something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley
          off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some
          garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at
          the sky with a pained look on his face.

          EXT. DUDLEY'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find
          DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his
          knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which
          he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed
          headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then
          look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding
          bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled
          about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all
          wearing "Wild Hogs" jackets. And on this, we:

          EXT. "BYKER'S ISLAND" BIKER BAR - LATER

          The guys pull up at a biker-theme bar with a motorcycle
          mounted above the entrance.

          Woody is obviously humiliated to have Dudley behind him,
          as they park the bikes among a crowd of other bikers.
          Dudley climbs off the back of Woody's bike and pats him
          on the shoulder.

                         DUDLEY
          Thanks, Woody. I feel really safe with
          you.

                         WOODY
          I noticed that. And if you ever lay your
          head on my back when you're riding bitch
          again, I'm going to throw you into
          traffic.

                         DUDLEY
          I was trying to keep my face out of the
          wind.

                         WOODY
          I felt you smell my hair!

                         DOUG
          Guys! Come on. Let's go get a brew.
          I'm buying.
          Doug heads into the bar.

                         BOB
          You're cool with the carbs?
          Doug pauses, without turning around.

                         DOUG

                         (MUMBLES)
          I can have a light.
          Doug continues into the bar, but now with less swagger.

          INT. "BYKER'S ISLAND" BIKER BAR - A MOMENT LATER

          The guys are sitting at a worn table. The place is
          crowded with curiously gentle-looking bikers. Woody
          looks around the bar with a smirk.

                         WOODY
          Man, I wish we could find a place that
          wasn't so freaking lame.

                         BOB
          What are you talking about? This place
          is cool. We're with other bikers.

          Suddenly, a large, bald biker comes up and slams a beer
          down on their table.

                         (ANGRILY)
          Wild Hogs aren't welcome here!
          The guys all look at him for a beat - then the Bald guy
          cracks a smile.

                         DOUG
          Hey, Paul.
          PAUL laughs at his joke.

                         PAUL
          Hey, guys... Woody, your tax return is
          almost done, but I want to talk to you
          next week about incorporating. A lot of
          my executive clients have been--

                         WOODY
          Yeah, Paul. I'll talk to you about it on
          the trip.

                         PAUL
          Yeah, we'll talk about in Daytona.
          (angrily, to group)
          What the hell are you staring at!?
          Paul glares at the other guys for a beat, then cracks up.

                         PAUL (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHING)
          See you guys.
          Paul exits. Woody shakes his head.

                         WOODY
          This place sucks. Why are we going to
          Daytona with these posers?

                         DOUG
          Because it's Bike Week. That's our
          annual trip, Woody. We're Wild Hogs.

                         WOODY
          We're not Wild Hogs. That's a patch your
          wife made and we all had to sew it on our
          jackets so she didn't feel bad.

                         (QUIETLY)
          Hard.

          Hey!?

                         BOB
          Sorry. I didn't... Don't tell her.

                         DOUG
          It's not a big secret, Bob. She's a
          swimsuit model. She's hot. I mean, so
          is my Kelly. She's very hot. Even after
          ten years. Not that I'm not still good
          looking...
          Doug looks at the guys. They don't respond.

                         WOODY
          We're not going to say you're hot, man.

                         DOUG
          Because it's gay, or because I'm not?

                         WOODY
          There's no non-gay response to that.

                         DUDLEY

                         (TO DOUG)
          If I were a girl, I'd be attracted to
          you.

                         WOODY
          Point proven.

                         BOB
          Well, Kelly must still think you're hot.
          Ten years, man. How's that feel?

                         DOUG
          I don't know. Good, I guess. Is ten the
          silver anniversary?

                         DUDLEY
          No, that's the 25th. Ten is aluminum.

          Aluminum? Like, siding?
          (considers, then)
          Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum
          is sturdy, lightweight... recycled.
          Woody smiles and puts a map down on the table.

                         WOODY
          --And ready for the trip of a lifetime.
          The guys look at the map, puzzled.

                         DOUG
          We don't need a map for Daytona. We just
          follow the group.
          Woody takes a drink from his beer, then looks at the
          group with a mischievous fire behind his eyes.

                         WOODY
          Not if we don't go on the Daytona trip.

                         DOUG
          What?

                         DUDLEY
          Noooo!!

                         WOODY
          Guys, listen to me. It's time for a
          change. Let's go on our own trip this
          year. Just us, like it was in college.
          Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach.
          Bike Week is just corporate white guys
          playing dress up. This bar is, too. And
          we didn't get into this to play dress up -
          we got in this to live. "Be cool and
          Ride free." That's the Wild Hog creed.

                         DOUG
          No, it's not. It's the slogan for the
          Downtown trolley.

                         WOODY
          I know. But, it works as our creed, too.
          So let's live it!

                         DUDLEY
          But, I boogie board in Daytona. Can't
          our creed be "Be cool and boogie board?"

                         WOODY
          No. That's dumb, Dudley. Let the big
          people talk.

                         DOUG
          Well, what kind of trip are you
          suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?

                         WOODY
          No. That's the best part. We don't do
          some planned out trip. We follow the
          open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of
          America. We take a week and go all the
          way to San Francisco. Think about it,
          guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we
          want, whenever we want... Just freedom.
          When was the last time we had that?
          The guys consider this, but look sceptical.

                         BOB
          I don't know, man.

                         WOODY
          You're afraid to ask your wife.

                         BOB

                         (COVERING)
          No...

                         WOODY

                         (TO DOUG)
          What do you think?

                         DOUG
          Well, Daytona isn't the "backbone of
          America," but it is a tradition. We've
          been riding with this club for years. Do
          we really want to miss out on that?
          One of the bikers, KENT, approaches carrying a box.

                         KENT
          Hey, dudes. Check these out.
          Kent holds up a sleeveless t-shirt with a big cartoon guy
          on a motorcycle - with the words "Born to Be Wild!
          Daytona ride, 2005." It's horrifying.

                          KENT (CONT'D)
          We're all going to wear these on the
          trip.

                         KENT (CONT'D)
          That way everyone will know we're from
          the Cincinnati chapter. It'll also get
          you ten percent off at T.G.I.Fridays.

                         DUDLEY
          Cool! Born to be wild!
          Dudley grabs a shirt and starts to pull it over the t-
          shirt he already has on. Woody gives a look to Bob and
          Doug.

                         DOUG
          Look, We'll talk about it tomorrow. But
           we don't need some trip to go "live." We

                          
           are living. Free and wild.

           SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - THE NEXT EVENING

           The anniversary party is in full swing. DOUG is watching

                          
          several guests dish steaming pasta and cream sauce out of
          a chaffing dish. He looks down at his plate of field
          greens and skinless chicken breast.

                         DOUG

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Free and wild.
          Doug looks around the party. Several middle-aged couples
          are dancing on the living room floor. Others mingle,
          laughing... Everyone is having a great time, except Doug,
          who stands there, listless.
          Kelly walks up and kisses him on the cheek.

                         KELLY

                          
          Hey, sweetie. Having fun?

                          

                         DOUG

                          
          Yeah. It's getting pretty late, though.

                          
          Maybe we should kill the music. Drop a

                          
          hint.

                          

                         KELLY

                          
          It's eight O'Clock. It started at seven.

                         DOUG
          oh.

                         (THEN)
          Still, that's late. We should just
          flicker the lights on and off. People
          will get it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 22.

                         KELLY
          People are having fun. Look at the
          Miltons.
          ANGLE ON: THE LIVING ROOM. A happy-looking couple, THE
          MILTONS, are dancing around to Prince's "1999." Doug 
          laughs. 

                         DOUG 
          Oh, man. There should be laws against 
          that... Is Fred having a seizure? 

                         KELLY 
          No, Fred's having a good time. With his 
          wife. Remember what that was like? 

                         DOUG
          Hey, we have fun all the time. But I'm
          not going to let myself look like that.
          He wears dress socks with shorts, too.
          I've seen it. Do you want me to do that?

                         KELLY 
          I don't care. Why do you? 
          Doug searches for a response, as ROGER, 70, Kelly's Dad, 
          clinks his wine glass at the front of the room. 

                         ROGER 
          Excuse me, everybody. I have a little 
          toast. For my daughter and her husband. 
          Roger winks at Doug and Kelly. Doug smiles weakly. 

                         DOUG 
          (sotto, to Kelly) 
          He's drunk. We should do something. 

                         ROGER 
          I want to start by saying how proud I am 
          of my son-in-law. 

                         DOUG 
          (sotto, to Kelly) 
          --No, he's fine. Let him talk. 

                         ROGER
          Now, I have to make an admission. Ten
          years ago, when Doug and Kelly got
          married. I was worried. Doug was a
          little wild...
          The guests laugh. Doug gives an unsure chuckle.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 23.

                         ROGER (CONT'D)
          I mean, he had that old trans-am with the
          huge engine... Remember how he'd peel
          out of anywhere? Even the grocery
          parking lot after buying baby formula?
          The guests laugh again. Now Doug isn't.

                         ROGER (CONT'D)
          Or the way he'd just grab Kelly and run
          off to some crazy island to snorkel with
          something that thinks you're lunch.

                          
          The guests continue to laugh. Kelly looks at Doug, now.

                          
          She sees this is landing on him. He's getting upset.

                         ROGER (CONT'D)
          But, not anymore. He's now become the
          son-in-law I would have always hoped for.
          Responsible, reliable, and a great
          husband to my daughter. So cheers to--

                         DOUG
          No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't
          an accurate toast. I'm still the same,
          shitty son-in-law I used to be.

                          
          The guests laugh. They think he's joking.

                          

                         ROGER

                          
          Come on, Doug. You should be proud!

                          
          You've grown up! Cheers!

                          
          The guests nod and clink their glasses. Doug shakes his

                          
          head.

                          

                         DOUG

                          
          Grown up? No, I haven't. I'm still

                          
          young. No cheers! Stop clinking!

                          

                         KELLY

                          
          Doug, stop it. You're being rude.

                          

                         DOUG

                          
          Well, tell them I'm the same as I used to

                          
          be, Kelly. Tell your Dad not to like me.

                         KELLY
          You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug
          wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for
          dancing, because he would have been out
          there dancing himself. With me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 24.

                         DOUG
          So what are you saying?

                         KELLY
          I'm saying you have changed. And
          frankly, i don't like it. I like you the
          way you were. I liked it when you
          weren't afraid of looking stupid. I
          liked it when we laughed. I liked it
          when we danced.

                         DOUG
          Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is
          lame. People like me need a fresh beat!
          Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station.
          "Cand Sho " h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along
          with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him.

                          DOUG (CONT'D)
           (yelling over music)
           Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't
           1980 anymore, man. Yeah!

                          (SINGS ALONG)
           I take you to the... Andy shop--
           Doug tries to confidently sing along, but struggles 
           awkwardly, as he's obviously never heard the song before. 

                          KELLY 
           (urging, to Doug) 
           Honey, stop it. You're being an ass. 

                          DOUG 
           What!? I thought this was what you 
           wanted? I'm dancing!
           Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly 
          grits her teeth. 

                          DOUG (CONT'D) 
           Come on, baby! Just because we're 
           married ten years doesn't mea n we're old 
           people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood! 
           Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly 
          grimaces and grabs his chest.

                          DOUG (CONT'D)
           Nope, that feels bad--

                          KELLY
           Doug? What's wrong? Are you okay?

                         DOUG
          Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I
          should go to the hospital--
          Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help
          him.

                         KELLY
          Doug!?

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

          Doug is in a bed, with Kelly next to him. A DOCTOR
          enters with a chart.

                         DOCTOR
          Well, Mr. Matthews--

                         DOUG
          Dr. Matthews, actually.

                         DOCTOR
          Oh, really? Great. Then, I can say this
          a lot easier. You had a hypertensive
          myocardial seizure.
          Doug nods confidently, then, after a moment:

                         DOUG

                         (DEFEATED)
          I'm a dentist, actually... I have no
          idea what you just said.

                         DOCTOR
          Oh. Sorry. It looks like you had a
          stress-induced panic attack.

                         DOUG
          Stress-induced? I'm not stressed.

                         DOCTOR
          Well, it's probably been pretty buried. I
          actually see it a lot with middle-aged men.
          Work, family, it can take a toll on you.

                         DOUG
          I'm not middle-aged.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 26.

                         DOCTOR
          Yeah, I see that a lot, too. Anyway. We
          should have you out of here soon.
          The doctor smiles and exits the room. Kelly looks at
          Doug.

                         DOUG
          I am middle aged, aren't I?

                         KELLY
          Only mathematically.
          Doug takes this in.

                         KELLY (CONT'D) 
          Doug, Let me ask you a question. When
          was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi
          song?

                         DOUG
          What?

                         KELLY
          You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the
          top of your lungs. Like you didn't care
          who heard you, or how dopey it sounded.

                          
          Then one day, you just stopped. That's

                          
          how it's been with everything. Romance,
          sense of humor, the way you used to give
          me that cocky little wink when you took

                          
          off your shirt... It's all faded away,

                          
          leaving just a shell of what you used to

                          
          be. Why? Why no more Bon Jovi songs?

                         DOUG
          I don't know. There's just a lot
          weighing me down these days, you know?

                         KELLY
          Like what? You have a great career, a

                          
          perfect family. Money is fine. The only

                          
          thing that could be weighing you down is

                          
          me. Is it me? Are you tired of me?

                         DOUG

                          
          No! of course, not. I could never be

                         TIRED OF--
          Doug stops himself, as it dawns on him. You can see the
          horror of realization creep across his face. He looks at
          Kelly, wide-eyed.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (REALIZING)
          It's me. I'm weighing me down. I'm not
          a guy I'd hang out with anymore, I'm...
          Me. What's cool about me? I don't even
          eat carbs. 

                         KELLY
          Then eat them. I'd rather have you sing 
          than have a thirty-four waist. 

                         DOUG 
          I still have a thirty-- 

                         KELLY
          No, you don't, Doug. I buy your pants.

                         (THEN)
          Look. We've been married ten years. And
          personally, I'd like to be married fifty
          more, but if you stay like this...
          Then... I don't know...

                         DOUG
          We are going to be married fifty more
          years, Kelly. I'm going to find old
          Doug. I just have to figure out where to
          look.
          Kelly takes a breath, and pulls out a map. She hands it 
          to Doug, who looks at it. 

                         DOUG (CONT'D) 
          Woody's map? 

                         KELLY 
          I took it away from him at the party. He 
          wouldn't stop waving it at Bob and 
          Dudley. 

                         DOUG 
          I thought you agreed it was a bad idea. 

                         KELLY
          It might be. But I'm desperate, Doug. I
          want us to be happy again. So go on it.
          It's my anniversary present to you.

                         DOUG
          Really?
          (considers, then)
          I only got you an ankle bracelet.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 28.

                         KELLY
          All I want is old Doug back. Please.
          This marriage can't survive without him. 
          Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good
          wife, and he knows it. Suddenly, BOB enters the room.

                         BOB
          Doug! Are you okay?

                         DOUG
          Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress.

                         BOB
          Oh, man. Thank god.

                         KELLY

                         (TO BOB)
          Where's Karen?

                         BOB
          Oh, she's waiting in the parking--
          SFX: A loud honk from the parking lot.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          That's her.
          Bob looks out the window nervously. Kelly looks at Doug.

                         KELLY
          You all need this trip.
          Doug gives her a knowing nod, then turns to Bob.

                         DOUG
          Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike
          week. Let's ride across U.S. 50.

                         BOB
          Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, We'll be
          leaving behind everything we're used to.
          SFX: The horn honks again from outside.

          KAREN (O.C.)
          (yelling from parking lot)
          Bob!? You said two minutes! I'm not
          circling!!
          Bob cringes. Doug shares a look with Kelly, then to Bob:

                         DOUG
          Yeah. I think that might be okay.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. STREET - THE NEXT WEEK

          DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear
          (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He
          approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and
          DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an
          entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys
          all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear.

                         WOODY

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          What? What's wrong with you?

                         DUDLEY
          I got a tat.

                         BOB
          A tattoo? You got a tattoo?

                         DUDLEY
          I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat!
          Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he
          is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath. On his bicep
          is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple. The guys nod, trying
          to look impressed.

                         DOUG
          Wow. That's...

                         DUDLEY
          Trademarked, I know. But what are they
          going to do? It's in my skin, bitch!
          Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket, as Woody ties a
          bandana skull-cap on his head. The guys look at Woody.

                         DOUG
          You're not wearing a helmet?

                         WOODY
          Nape. I don't want anything between me
          and the road, man.

                         DOUG
          You will if your head falls on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 30.
          Woody shrugs and starts his bike.

                         WOODY
          Look, the only rule on this trip is to
          have no plan. We're riding to San
          Francisco, and nothing else is planned.
          Just riding free.

                         DOUG
          Well, if we're going to make it in five
          days, we'll should probably get to
          Illinois by tonight.

                         BOB
          Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should
          be a hundred miles past St. Louis by
          sundown.

                         WOODY
          What? No. No plan. It's the open road.
          Who knows where we'll be.

                         DOUG
          I do. I have this little GPS system.
          Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it
          and throws it into a storm drain.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Hey! What the hell, man? That was
          expensive!

                         WOODY
          I did it for the good of the trip, Doug.
          You don't need GPS to discover America.
          We just need the wind, our bikes, and
          freedom. And if we have an emergency, I
          always have a cell phone--
          Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it
          in the storm drain.

                         DOUG
          Hah! How's that feel?
          Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.

                         WOODY
          It felt good. It felt damn good.

                         (ANNOUNCES)
          No cell phones!

                         DOUG

                         (WORRIED)
          What?

                         BOB
          He's right, Doug. Wild Hogs!
          Bob takes his cellphone and throws it in the storm drain.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          You just did that so Karen wouldn't call.

                         BOB
          Yup.
          Bob starts his bike.

                         DOUG
          So we're not even going to talk about
          this? I mean, shouldn't we at least--

                         DUDLEY
          Yeeeeaaah! Freedom!!
          Dudley throws his cellphone, but instead of going into
          the storm drain, it goes flying into traffic and smashes
          against an oncoming pickup truck. We hear the truck
          screech to a stop after it passes them.

                         DOUG

                         (QUICKLY)
          Okay, let's ride!
          The guys all hastily start their bikes and take off up
          the freeway ramp. We hear the truck driver screaming
          profanities as they guiltily ride away.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY

          MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT's "(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER."
          The four guys ride along the highway, through the hills
          of Indiana, smiling and nodding to each other. It's the
          Easy Rider moment. The camera ROTATES AROUND and PULLS
          OVERHEAD. It's beautiful country and the guys are in
          heaven. Dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties,
          as well as World War II motorcycle goggles.

          A family in a station wagon pulls up to next to them.
          Two kids press their faces against the windows, looking
          at the bikers in awe. Bob looks over at the kids in his
          mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod. The
          kids are amazed. Bob looks to Doug. Doug grins. They
          love this. Bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns
          his engine. The others nod, gun their engines and speed
          away from the station wagon. The kids watch with their
          mouths open.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys are cruising along as before, but now we see the
          sky has gotten very cloudy and overcast.

          SFX: THUNDER CRACK
          The guys look up at the sky apprehensively.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          It's now pouring rain. The guys ride along in misery,
          getting soaked. After a moment, the station wagon from
          before pulls back up to them. The kids are still pressed
          against the window, staring at the drenched bikers. Bob
          looks over and tries to give them another cocky nod - but
          now it's just embarrassing.

          END MUSIC CUE

          EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 - THAT EVENING

          The sun has gone down, and the guys have found a deserted
          area off the highway to set up camp. DOUG, WOODY and BOB
          lounge by a fire - with a tent set up behind them. Doug
          is roasting marshmallows and Bob is straining to blow up
          an air mattress.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          Why didn't you just bring a sleeping bag
          like us?

                         BOB
          This is more comfortable.
          (blows a breath into it)
          I wish Karen would have let me buy the
          foot pump, though.

          Bob continues to inflate the mattress, as Dudley
          approaches with a knotted plastic grocery bag.

                         DUDLEY
          This is poop. Don't eat it.
          Dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire.

                         DOUG
          Dudley? You're supposed to bury that.

                         WOODY
          Yes. Go bury it.

                         DUDLEY
          It's in a plastic bag. I can't put that
          in the earth. I'll find a trash bin
          tomorrow.
          The guys shake their heads and look back into the fire.
          After a moment, Doug smiles.

                         DOUG
          This is really nice, you know? Chilling
          by the fire with your best friends. Just
          relaxing, and enjoying--

                         WOODY

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          I'm sorry. Dudley, you have to get rid
          of that bag or I'm going to vomit in your
          lap.

                         DOUG
          --each other's company...
          Dudley grabs the bag and heads off.

                         DUDLEY
          Fine. I'll just hang it on a tree.

                         WOODY
          (yells after him)
          Don't hang it on a tree!

                         DOUG
          Yup... These are the times we'll
          remember.
          After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Hey, when was the last time you guys
          heard me sing Bon Jovi?

                         WOODY
          Oh, man. Thank God that stopped.

                         BOB
          It's been awhile. You're not as
          obnoxious as you used to be. You used to
          eat a lot more buffalo wings, too.

                         DOUG
          Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in
          the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe
          carbs are what I need to get old Doug
          back.

                         WOODY
          Old Doug? You've lost your Dad?

                         DOUG
          No. I think I've lost me. It's this
          thing Kelly said.

                         (BEAT)
          You know what it is? I think I'm tame.
          I'm like a lion that used to be wild, but
          now I'm in some Disney park where tourists
          come by and take pictures of me like I'm a
          lion, but after they leave, I go into my
          kennel and eat antelope nuggets or
          something. Ones without carbs.

                         BOB
          I know what you're talking about. I
          lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and
          daughters killed him. I'm surrounded by
          women every minute of my life. And it's
          made me, you know...

                         DOUG
          A wimp?

                         BOB
          What? No. I was going to say miserable.
          You think I'm a wimp?

                         DOUG
          No. I just thought that was what you
          were... I thought you wanted us to
          guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I
          said "wimp." Knowing it was wrong...

                         WOODY
          You're a wimp, Bob. I'll say it. You're
          afraid of girls. It's embarrassing.
          Dudley comes up and sits back down.

                         DUDLEY
          I'm afraid of girls.

                         WOODY
          You're afraid to talk to one. Bob is
          afraid they'll kill him in his sleep.

                         DUDLEY
          Wow. Now I really don't want to talk to
          one.

                         BOB
          You know, it's not always so bad. Like,
          when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over
          and pushes up against me. Just snuggles
          right up like she needs me. I like that.
          I like that a lot.
          (then, sobering)
          Then the sun comes up and turns her into
          a raging she-demon.

                         DOUG
          Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple
          as it was when we were in college. Well,
          except for you, Woody. You're still
          living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model
          wife. Big job at an investment firm.
          You've got the good life.
          Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the
          fire for a beat.

                         WOODY

                         (FLATLY)
          Yeah... The good life. I'm a lucky man.

                         DUDLEY
          My life blows. I don't have a family.
          Or a wife. I have a cat that doesn't
          like me. She wouldn't even stick around
          if she knew how to use a can opener.
          The guys all look at Dudley.

                         BOB
          Hey, Dudley. You've got us, buddy. And
          you're going to get a woman, too.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          I told you we were going to hit some
          strip clubs when we get back.

                         DUDLEY
          Nah, I don't like those places--

                         BOB
          Dudley-- Please. I'm trying to help you
          here.

                         DUDLEY
          I know. I just don't--

                         BOB
          Please! Strippers are nice to me!

                         DUDLEY
          Okay... Sorry. We'll go.

                         BOB
          Thanks, man.

                         (THEN)
          I'm just... trying to be a good friend.

                         DOUG
          We know, Bob.

                         WOODY
          I'll go, too.

                         DOUG
          There's a surprise.
          Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          All right, who wants their marshmallow
          well-done?
          The guys just look at it.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Yeah, I left that one on too long.
          Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying
          behind him. The guys don't notice - but we see the
          marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn. Bob
          continues to huff on the air mattress. He stops and
          looks at it.

                         BOB
          (out of breath)
          I think I'm half way there.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          You sure you don't want us to spread out
          a sleeping bag? We have three in the--
          Doug turns around and sees a foot-wide flame now burning
          on the tent.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Shit! The tent--
          Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Dudley, get the water jug off my bike!
          Dudley hurries over to Doug's bike as Doug and Bob try to
          smother the flame with sand.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          It should be okay. It's fire retardant.
          The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes
          running with a jug. He quickly takes off the cap. Doug
          notices him.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Dudley, no! That's
          It's too late. Dudley is already throwing it on the
          fire. The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into
          flames. The guys shield themselves.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley!
          Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly
          disentergrates the tent. Doug, Bob and Woody just watch,
          knowing there's nothing they can do. After a moment,
          DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and
          empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash. It does
          nothing.

                         DUDLEY
          We need more water.

                         DOUG
          That was all of it, Dudley. That was all
          the water we had.

                         DUDLEY
          Oh.
          Dudley takes this in for a moment.

                          DUDLEY (CONT'D)
           Is anybody else thirsty?
          The guys just look at him.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 -- THE NEXT MORNING

          BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bob's air
          mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see
          a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress.
          It's a stern-looking highway patrolman.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          You guys all right?

                         DOUG
          Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          All right. Just making sure.

                         (BEAT)
          Looks pretty comfortable, actually.
          We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his
          thigh. Doug quickly jumps up, waking the others.

                         DOUG
          Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have
          a nice day, officer.
          The highway patrolman laughs.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          All right, I get it.

                         (WINKS)
          Five's a crowd.
          Doug is mortified. The officer looks them over for a
          moment.

          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT'D)
          You guys are lucky to have each other.
          (looks at them hungrily)
          Damn lucky.

                         (OBLIVIOUS)
          That's what I always say.
          Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug. We see he's
          wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          Well... Have a good one.
          The patrolman walks off. Dudley looks at Doug and grins.

                         DUDLEY
          Morning.

                         DOUG
          Please put your pants on.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys cruise through the rolling prairies of Missouri.
          It's another beautiful day. They ride in formation,
          until Woody's bandana doo-rag blows off. Woody goes back
          to get it. The other guys stop and wait for him to
          return.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER

          The guys are still riding - but now the heat of the
          Missouri plains is taking it's toll. They look boiling,
          and have sweated through their clothes. Bob takes a
          drink of water from a bottle of water, then pours the
          water over his head. He breathes a sigh of relief, until
          he hears an angry yell behind him. He looks back and
          sees Woody is now drenched from the water. Bob smiles
          sheepishly as Woody burns.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY

          The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking
          even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring
          into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys
          nod in agreement.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BLANCHARD SPRINGS, OZARK NATIONAL FOREST - LATER

          DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in
          their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like
          dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up.

                         BOB
          Thanks for waiting for me, jerks.
          The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and
          cannonballs into the water.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold:
          He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          What?

                         WOODY
          Why are you naked?

                         BOB
          We're swimming. You guys kept on your
          skivies?

                         DOUG
          Skivies? What are you, a Newsie?

                         DUDLEY
          I kept mine on because I didn't want
          everyone to see my crank.

                         WOODY

                         (TO BOB)
          Yeah. That, and being naked with a bunch
          of guys is gay. What's wrong with you?

                         BOB
          I don't know. We took showers and stuff
          together in college. I thought this was
          kind of... you know, the same.

                         DOUG
          I guess I get that.

                         (THINKS)
          I mean, we would have been naked in
          college. Why are we... Oh, man. It's
          true. We are tamed. We're old guys.

                         WOODY
          No, we're not. Don't say that.
          Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air.

                         DOUG
          I will find old Doug!
          Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley
          smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up.

                         DUDLEY
          I will... Do what Doug does!
          Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at
          Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers.

                         WOODY
          I will be naked with my gay friends, and
          if they look at my jock, I will kill
          them.
          Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at
          each other and smile. It's a nice moment.
          Until a family approaches.
          Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with
          three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The
          young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the
          family laughs and shakes his head.

                         FAMILY DAD
          Hope you guys don't mind a little
          company. The mini-van was getting a

                         LITTLE--
          The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He
          realizes, then looks at his kids, concerned.

                         DOUG
          Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I

                         UH--

                         WOODY
          There's a shallower spring up the path.
          The kids might like that even more...
          The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The
          Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.

                         (TO WOODY)
          Oh, no. These little squirts like to

                         DIVE AND--
          The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water,
          and realizes. She suddenly looks very uncomfortable.

          FAMILY MOM (CONT'D)

                         (VERY TENSE)
          Janey, Kyle, Holland. Out of the water.
          We're going to find a new spot.

                         JANEY
          No, Mama. This place has little rocks

                         THAT--

                         FAMILY MOM
          Get out of the damn water! Now!
          The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off
          with them down the path. After a moment of awkward
          silence, Doug looks at the guys.

                         DOUG
          We should go.

                         BOB
          You think? They're gone, now.

                         WOODY
          Yeah, we could stay another few--

          VOICE (O.C.)
          Whhheeeeew!
          The guys look to the other side of the spring to see the
          HIGHWAY PATROLMAN cannonball naked into the spring. They
          stare, horrified, as he pops up and smiles at them.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
          Saw you're bikes out there. You guys
          ever chicken fight?
          The guys look at each other for a moment, then;

          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
          Ahhhh! / Oh, god! / Run!
          They frantically sprint out of the water, grab their
          clothes and hurry away.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the
          wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once
          again, but suddenly Doug smiles...
          On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are
          several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to
          the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis.
          The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes.
          Bob immediately falls to the ground.

                         BOB
          Dammit! Leg's asleep.
          The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike
          and falls to the ground.

                         DUDLEY
          Me, too.

                         DOUG
          You guys have to shift every once in
          awhile. Blood has to circulate.
          A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their
          sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.

                         WOODY
          Now this is the best part of any road
          trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels.
          Look at this place. America!
          The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack
          of a bar. Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front.

                         DOUG
          Look at these bikes. They're all
          classics.

                         BOB
          Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead.
          You know how rare this thing is?
          The guys all crowd around the bike.

                         DOUG
          Yeah, but why didn't he customize it?
          You have a 51 panhead and you don't
          chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an
          eagle on the gas tank? What a waste.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 44.

                         WOODY
          Probably no good custom stores out here
          in hick-land. We'll leave 'em a catalog.
          The guys push open the door and step into the bar.

          INT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS

          The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw
          before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing.
          We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn
          and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BIKERS)
          How's it going?

                         BOB
          Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends.
          I'm surprised we've never seen you in
          Daytona.
          The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of
          the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's -
          and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces.

                         JACK
          Yeah, how do we keep missing that?
          The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though
          they don't quite get what's so funny.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          So you re "Wild Hogs," huh? That's your
          gang?

                         DOUG
          Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends
          that ride... you know.

                         JACK
          So it's like a little hobby for you guys?
          How sweet.
          Doug smiles, but is now sensing the hostility. He looks
          back for the exit.

                         DUDLEY

                         (TO JACK)
          Yeah, just a little hobby for us.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 45.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          We're all successful professionals in
          real life. But on Tuesday and Sunday
          afternoons... We're bikers!
          Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his
          jacket.

                         JACK
          Wow. That's great. Can I try that on?

                         DUDLEY
          Hell yeah, brother.
          Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who
          pulls it on his massive frame. He shows it to the gang,
          who laugh again. Dudley does, too.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          So who's '51 panhead is that? Sweet
          ride. Woody has a catalog so you can
          make it cool.

                         WOODY
          No, I don't. Doug does. I think it's
          great the way it is.
          Doug glares at Woody incredulously. Woody shrugs.

                         JACK

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          Well, if you like my '51, we should
          trade... "brother."

                         DOUG

                         DUDLEY--

                         DUDLEY

                         (IGNORING DOUG)
          I wish! I just have a Sportster. It's
          worth, like, half of yours.

                         JACK
          A Sportster!? That's what I grew up on.
          I've been wanting another Sportster.
          It's a deal!

                         DUDLEY
          Seriously? You're serious!?

                         DOUG
          Dudley, maybe you should--

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 46.

                         DUDLEY
          Doug, don't worry. Yeah, I'll have a
          cooler bike than you, but that doesn't
          mean I'll get all cocky.

                         DOUG

                         DUDLEY--

                         DUDLEY
          Hey, I don't care what you say! I ride a
          panhead now! I'm better than you!

                         JACK
          Come on, Dud. Let's go see how you look
          on it.
          Jack smiles and leads Dudley outside. Doug, Bob and
          Woody share an uncertain look.

                         WOODY
          Anybody else got that "pre-rape" feeling?

          EXT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Everyone is standing out front. Dudley starts to get on
          the classic motorcycle. Jack stops him.

                         JACK
           Oh, no, no. That's Oilcan's ride. My
          ' 51 panhead is right over there.
          Jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles.
          Among it is the junked carcass of a '51 panhead next to
          an old, rusty sidecar. Dudley looks confused.

                         DUDLEY
          That? That's a piece of junk.

                         JACK
          Yup. Your piece of junk.
          Woody, Doug and Bob look at each other. This isn't good.
          Doug tries to laugh it off.

                         DOUG
          All right, guys. We get the joke... Good
          one. Anyway, we actually should get
          moving along.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 47.

                         JACK
          Oh, it's no joke. You want to know the
          joke? Suburban assholes that buy leather
          outfits and think they're bikers. And
          it's a joke I'm damn sick of. So I'm
          keeping your friend's bike, I'm keeping
          this jacket, and you guys are going to
          turn the hell around and go back to
          wherever you came from, because the next
          hundred miles of this highway belongs to
          the Hells Angels.
          The color drains from the Wild Hog's faces.

                         DUDLEY
          Like an adopt a highway thing?

                         JACK
          Like a "Go home or we're going to split
          your skulls open" thing.
          Bob makes an audible whimper. Doug elbows him, and tries
          to look brave.

                         DOUG
          All right. We respect that this is your
          turf, and we're sorry for bothering you.
          But we can't head back without my
          friend's bike. So clearly we're going to
          have to work something out here.
          Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods.

                         JACK
          You're right. We're going to have to
          work something out.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER

          We see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar,
          looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the
          rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY
          sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his
          jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt).
          The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody
          waves for them to stop. They do and Woody looks back to
          the bar.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 48.

                         WOODY
          All right. Let's just give them a few
          minutes to get back inside - then shoot
          right past them.

                         BOB
          What? Are you nuts?

                         DOUG
          The trip's over, Woody. Let's just head
          back home.

                         WOODY
          We're going to turn back after all these
          miles? Just because some fat bully's
          pushed us around?

                         DOUG BOB
          Yes. Yes.
          Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley.

                         DUDLEY
          I go wherever you go.

                         WOODY
          Good. See? Dudley's got some balls.

                         DUDLEY
          No, my sidecar's just attached to your
          bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I
          could only roll so far...

                         WOODY
          I can't believe you guys. What a bunch
          of pussies. The whole point of this trip
          is to live, man.

                         DOUG
          That's the point, Woody. Our lives
          aren't on this highway. They're back
          home. We have families, jobs, wives...
          or cats... We're not going to piss off a
          biker gang. We're going back.
          Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Come on, Woody. You don't want to take
          this risk. You have Claudia, and your
          job... You have a great life back home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 49.
          Woody looks up at him. Something about this has sparked
          something in Woody's eyes, but he covers it up with a
          calm smile.

                         WOODY
          You're right, I do. But maybe I should
          talk to those guys one more time. I
          mean, I'm an executive at an Investment
          firm. I've made a career out of
          convincing people and these are just
          people. You guys wait here.
          Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each
          other and shrug. Dudley hurries out of the sidecar.

                         DUDLEY
          I'll wait here, too. You'll get better
          gas mileage.
          Dudley gets out and falls to the ground.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Leg's asleep.
          Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar.

          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure
          he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that
          he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels
          motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices
          through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts
          leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.

                         WOODY

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Come after us now, assholes.
          Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird
          recklessness as he slices through each gas line.

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          WOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY
          are waiting.

                         WOODY
          They're cool with it. We can press on.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 50.

                         BOB
          Seriously?

                         WOODY
          Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to
          reason. I told them Dudley was dying.

                         DUDLEY
          What?

                         WOODY
          Well, technically we're all dying,
          Dudley. Just very slowly.
          Dudley looks concerned.

                         DUDLEY
          Oh my god, you're right.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm slowly dying.

                         WOODY
          Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid
          it out for them. I said, "Hey, go ahead
          and assault us. Because we might be not
          be real bikers, but we know real lawyers.
          And the moment you touch us is the moment
          you get your ass sued. Because this is
          the real world - with real laws, and real
          consequences." And they backed down.
          The guys are impressed.

                         DOUG
          You really said that?

                         WOODY
          Yup. And I think they'll give us
          Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's
          go. Quick. Before they change their
          mind.
          Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys
          shrug, impressed, and follow him.
          After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.

          INT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          Jack is playing darts with the other bikers. He goes to
          throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside.

          He quickly turns, which makes the dart he was throwing
          fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the
          bikers, (OILCAN).

                         OILCAN
          Ow! Shit, man!
          Jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away.
          Jack shakes his head, enraged.

                         JACK
          Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen.
          The guys nod and head outside. Oilcan pulls the dart out
          of his shoulder, and stops by Jack on the way out.

                         OILCAN
          Try and watch the throws, okay Jack?
          Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into
          his peck.

                         OILCAN (CONT'D)
          Owww! Jesus!
          (off Jack's icy glare)
          Sorry.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BIKER BAR - A MINUTE LATER

          The Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their
          motorcycles. They get to the end of the driveway, and
          the bikes sputter and choke to a stop.
          ANGLE ON: JACK. He's on his hog, with a cigarette
          dangling out of his mouth. He looks down in confusion at
          the suddenly stalled bike.

                         JACK
          What the f--
          (sees cut gas line)
          You've gotta be kidding me.
          Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and
          onto the ground. A puddle of gas from the sliced line
          catches on fire.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          shit.
          The flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a
          fuse, back towards the bar.

          Almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look, the
          flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the
          puddles of gas. They all watch in horror as the fire
          ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar, then
          the roof ...

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - SAME TIME

          The guys happily cruise along the highway. We see WOODY
          look in his side-view mirror and notice a large, black
          plume of smoke back in the distance. A look of worry
          creeps over his face.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. MOTEL - THAT EVENING

          The guys pull up to a small motel, as the sun sets behind
          the wheat fields of Kansas.

                         WOODY
          No, we're not stopping here. Riding at
          night is half the fun. Let's just keep--

                         DOUG
          --I can't feel my nuts, Woody. And Kelly
          still wants another kid.
          DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY head inside the motel office.

                         WOODY
          (calling after Doug)
          So, adopt a kid. You already have two
          white ones, anyway.
          The guys ignore him. Woody looks back down the highway
          uneasily, then heads inside the motel office.

          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          JACK, and the other bikers stand by the smoldering pile
          of wood that was once their bar. OILCAN approaches Jack.

                         OILCAN
          I got my old lady bringing some gas. We
          can get moving by nightfall.

                         JACK

                         (BOILING)
          Forget it. Those guys are long gone.

          They're not stupid enough to stop until
          they're five hundred miles from here.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

          DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are in their motel room. WOODY
          stands at the window, nervously looking outside.

                         WOODY

                         (TO GUYS)
          I just think it's just stupid to stop
          this soon, you know?... We can keep
          riding under the stars. All night.

                         DOUG
          Woody, your headlight doesn't even work.

                         WOODY
          You think I won't ride without light? I
          can feel the road. Let's go. I'll even
          race somebody. Who's racing me?

                         DOUG
          Did you inhale exhaust fumes? Because
          something is happening to your brain. I
          think it might be retardation.

                         WOODY
          I just want to ride. Let's go!

                         DOUG
          Whatever, Corky.
          Doug shrugs Woody off and dials his cell phone.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hey, honey. It's me.
          Woody glares at Doug.

                         WOODY
          You're calling Kelly? You're not aloud
          to call wives on a road trip.

                         DOUG

                         (TO WOODY)
          I can call my wife whenever I want.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yeah. Woody. Good guess...

          Yeah, I'm having a great time. No old
          Doug, yet, but I haven't gotten sun-
          burned...
          Woody looks at Bob.

                         WOODY
          You agree with me, right?

                         BOB
          Yeah, I actually agree with you on this
          one. Let's not call wives.

                         DOUG

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yeah, Bob agreed with him. Good guess
          again. Man, I really miss you.

                         WOODY
          Are you kidding me? I have to leave.
          Let me know when lame hour is over.

                         DOUG

                         (TO WOODY)
          Woody, you can call Claudia when I'm
          done, if you want. You can use my cell.

                         WOODY
          No, I'm not calling Claudia. I mean, yes
          I want to, but I won't. Because I'm on a
          road trip with my pals. And cell phones
          aren't even allowed!
          Woody storms out. Doug hears something on the phone, and
          lights up.

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY ride along the highway, as
          the sun burns the morning fog off of the wheat fields.
          Doug looks over to Woody and yells above the motorcycle
          engines.

          I can't believe you made us leave so
          early. You really wanted to see the sun
          rise?

                         WOODY
          Yeah, man. It warms my heart, with

          says "Lucas, Kansas. Population: 436"

                         BOB
          (yelling over engines)
          Hey! Let's stop for breakfast, I'm
          starving.

                         WOODY
          What!? No! We're not hungry yet.

                         BOB
          I just said I was--

                         WOODY
          You're not! Fatty!
          Bob looks hurt. Doug gives Woody a stern look.

                         DOUG
          Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat
          town. And Dudley's got another bag of
          poop to throw away.
          Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the
          town. It's a quiet, one stop-light town - with an old
          fashioned main street and town square. We see a banner
          over the street advertising a block party that night.
          It's a postcard version of small town America.

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME

          The owner, BUD, is pressed up against the glass -
          watching the motorcycles come down Main street. He
          shakes his head.

                         BUD
          Oh, don't tell me they're here again
          already. I just got the window replaced.

          Bud walks back to the bar, past his daughter (and diner
          waitress) MAGGIE, 28, pretty in that cute, small town
          way.

                         MAGGIE
          Just stay calm, Dad. At least it's not
          all of them, this time.

          EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME

          The guys pull up to the diner and we see the local
          pedestrians hustle away. The street is soon deserted,
          but the guys don't notice.
          They go to park their bikes, but there's not enough
          space. There's a police car in the parking spot next to
          them, and the town sheriff, CHARLEY, comes running
          towards it from across the street.

                         CHARLEY
          I'll move it! Hold on, I'll move it!
          Charley jumps into the car and backs it out of its spot.
          The guys look at each other, surprised.

                         DOUG
          Wow. Lucas is a polite town.

                         BOB
          That's how these little towns are. It's
          unspoiled America.

                         WOODY
          It's a shithole. Let's keep moving.
          The guys ignore Woody and enter the diner.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Okay, we'll get it to go, then. We can
          ride and eat if it's wrapped in a
          tortilla.
          Woody gets no response. He looks back down the road,
          uneasily, then follows the guys in.

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME

          BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY enter, with their motorcycle
          boots thunking on the wood floor, announcing to the
          entire diner that there are bikers there.

          Everyone freezes and the place goes silent. The only
          sound is a single fork dropping onto a plate.
          BUD is pulsing with anger, but he swallows it down.

                         BUD
          Good morning, gentleman. How nice of you
          to join us this afternoon.

                         DOUG
          well, how could we pass through this town
          without stopping? Everything looks so
          perfect.

                         BUD

                         (SEETHING)
          But you'll change that, huh?

                         DOUG
          Excuse me?
          MAGGIE runs up and guides her Dad away from the guys.

                         MAGGIE
          I'll take care of them, Daddy.
          (to guys, extra polite)
          Good morning.
          Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though
          she's scared to death.
          DUDLEY stares at her, captivated. He's in love.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          where would you gentleman like to sit?

                         DOUG
          Are there any booths open?
          All the people quickly jump out of their booths.

                         BOB
          Wow. Everyone is so nice, here.
          The guys sit in one of the booths. Dudley hangs back,
          and struggles to talk to Maggie.

                         DUDLEY

                         (TO MAGGIE)
          Um... So?
          Dudley tries to think of something else to say, but
          can't. He nods awkwardly, then heads over to the booth.
          He sits down with the guys.

          She's perfect.

          You like the waitress, huh?

                         DUDLEY
          I wanted to say something funny to her,
          but I could only think of black jokes.
          Maggie, still very skittish, approaches the table.

                         MAGGIE
          And what would you gentleman like today?
          Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying
          french toast.

                         DOUG
          Mmmm. I'll have what he's having.
          Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She
          slides it in front of Doug.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can
          keep his.

                         MAGGIE
          Of course. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
          Maggie quickly puts it back on the man's table.

                         DOUG
          Hey, it's okay. Really.

                         WOODY
          Not a big deal.

                         (FAKING ANGRY)
          Yeah, just don't let it happen again!
          Bob hammers his fist on the table and laughs at his joke,
          but Maggie starts to cry. The guys suddenly look
          confused as she runs to the kitchen in tears. Bob looks
          back to the guys.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Wow. That wasn't funny.

                         DUDLEY
          It's hard to be funny without being
          racist.
          Doug is looking at the town's local paper, and smiles.

                         DOUG
          Hey, guys. This block party tonight
          looks cool. Music, grilled corn, dollar
          beers, funnel cakes.

                         DUDLEY
          Funnel cakes!? Let's stay here tonight!

                         WOODY
          No, no, no, no. We have a schedule. San
          Francisco is waiting.

                         BOB
          What schedule? You said we're taking
          this trip to live. Let's stick around
          and live a little. Have some small town
          fun!
          Woody goes to protest again, but Dudley stands up.

                         DUDLEY

                         (LOUDLY)
          Let's party all night in Lucas!

                         BUD
          (O.C. From kitchen area)
          God Dammit! What'd we do to deserve
          this!?
          We ANGLE TO SEE: MAGGIE rush over to calm BUD down. Bud
          calms down, then hears another motorcycle engine roaring
          down the street. He looks out the window and shakes his
          head.

                         BUD (CONT'D)
          Not another one of these assholes.
          A moment later, MURDOCK, a fat, grungy Hells Angel,
          enters the diner with a cocky swagger and has a seat at
          the bar.

                         MURDOCK

                         (TO BUD)
          Get me a beer, old man. And if it's not
          good, I'm going to smash it across your
          face.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 60.
          ANGLE ON: The WILD HOGS, watching from the table behind
          Murdock.

                         DOUG
          (sotto, to the guys)
          Not another one of these assholes.
          Murdock hears this and whips around to see the Wild Hogs.

                         MURDOCK
          What'd you say?

                         DOUG
          Oh, I was actually referring to some guys
          we met at a bar about two hundred miles
          east of here. You're probably not

                         AFFILIATED--

                         MURDOCK
          That's my gang. I'm on my way there now.

                         DUDLEY
          (loudly, to Doug)
          so he is one of those assholes, Doug.

                         MURDOCK
          Excuse me?
          Murdock puts his beer down, and stares angrily at Doug.

                         MURDOCK (CONT'D)
          And who the hell are you freaks?
          Doug starts to answer, but Woody, looking nervous, cuts
          him off.

                         WOODY
          --Oh, we're just a group of friends. No
          big deal. Your guys gave us permission
          to pass by, so it's all good.

                         MURDOCK
          Hells Angel's don't give permission.
          Especially to a bunch of ball-less wimps
          like you.
          Bob hammers the table and stands up - his face red with
          long-suppressed rage.

                         BOB
          I'm not a wimp, pal'. I'm a man! You got
          that? Huh? You got that!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 61.
          The guys look at Bob, wide-eyed. woody looks worried.

                         WOODY
          Bob, let's not get carried away--

                         BOB
          No, you know what? This guy needs a
          talking to just like his friends did,
          Woody.

                         WOODY
          But, Bob. I don't think--

                         BOB
          Let me do this, Woody! You stood up to
          them last time, and I just sat there like
          I always do... Well, not this time!
          (turns to Murdock)
          Listen, you piece of shit. You think you
          can just walk around and bully perfectly
          nice people? You think that's how it
          works? Well, guess what? This is the
          real world. With real laws and real
          consequences. You hear me!?
          Bob swats Murdock's beer out of his hand. It spills all
          over him. Murdock is too filled with rage to speak.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Now get out of here! And if that gang of
          inbred assholes needs things explained to
          them again, tell 'em the Wild Hogs will
          be right here in Lucas tonight.
          Woody puts his face into his hands.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Now get.
          Murdock just stares daggers at him.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Get!
          Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock. He almost
          falls, but catches himself on a stool. He glares at the
          guys, but he's outnumbered. He grits his teeth and
          storms out the door. Woody winces to himself as he
          watches Murdock go. This isn't good.
          After a moment, BUD comes running out from behind the
          bar.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 62.

                         BUD
          Wait... You guys aren't Hells Angels?

                         DOUG
          Us? Oh, no. We're from Cincinnati.
          Bud calls out to the kitchen.

                         BUD
          Charley!? They ain't the bad ones!
          CHARLEY, the sheriff from before, stands up from behind a
          countertop in the kitchen.

                         CHARLEY
          You guys aren't Hells Angels?

                         DOUG
          No. We're Wild Hogs. That's our gang.

                         (THEN)
          And our rotary club softball team... My
          wife had extra patches.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, sweet Mary Joseph... Welcome to
          Lucas! I'm the sheriff, Charley Baskins.
          I keep the peace here.

                         DOUG
          Weren't you just hiding in the kitchen?

                         CHARLEY
          Well... A non-confrontation approach
          sometimes is the best method to keep
          aggression...

                         (GIVES UP)
          Yeah, I was hiding in the kitchen.
          Charley looks at them for a moment, then starts to tear
          up.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm an embarrassment.
          Charley hurries off to the bathroom. The guys look at
          each other.

                         DOUG
          Well, now he is.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 63.

          EXT. MAIN STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB,
          WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up
          around the park in the center - ready for the block
          party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are
          friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets
          again.

                         CHARLEY
          Sorry about all the confusion when you
          arrived. Those guys are pretty rough.
          You're the first people to ever stand up
          to them.

                         DOUG
          Well, Woody is the one who really--

                         BOB
          Hey-- we should probably share the
          credit. I mean, I just basically kicked
          that guy's ass. Man! You know how good
          that felt!? Yeah!
          Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles
          against its post, then falls to the ground. Bob
          immediately looks regretful.

                         DOUG
          Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down
          the block and get more exercise.

                         BOB
          (suddenly meek again)
          Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should.

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          I'm sorry... I didn't mean to--

                         CHARLEY
          Forget about it. We only have one
          cripple and he gets pulled around in a
          wagon. Come on, I want to show you guys
          something.
          Charley leads the guys off.

          INT. POLICE GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police
          garage. In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley
          Davidson police bike.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 64.

                         DOUG
          Wow. That's fantastic.

                         BOB
          You ride this?

                         CHARLEY
          Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it
          to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I
          just keep it in here. Polish it and so
          forth. But I'd never let them see it.

                         DOUG
          Those guys are that big of a problem,
          huh?

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah. They ride into town a few times a
          month and get drunk, damage property...
          Basically turn the place upside down.

                         DOUG
          And the police don't do anything?

                         CHARLEY
          Well, It's a small town - and me and the
          Dooble brothers are the only law. And
          they're still pretty green.

                         WOODY
          Can't you call a bigger town or something
          for backup?

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, I've done that a few times. But
          the gang is always gone by the time they
          get here. We've also tried wearing riot
          gear, which does protect you from being
          hit, but not from being dragged. Also,
          one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw
          tear gas, but the bottle exploded and
          blew off his ear.

                         DUDLEY
          Ech.

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, he's hard to look at.

                         (THEN)
          Anyway, we want you guys to stay at our
          hotel tonight on us... Seeing as you're
          the new town heroes and all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 65.
          The guys look flattered. Except Woody.

                         WOODY
          Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on--

                         DOUG

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          We'd be honored to stay. Thank you.
          Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern
          glare.

                         CHARLEY
          And if you're not in a rush to leave in
          the morning-- We've got a great trout
          stream you might want to check out.

                         DUDLEY
          Cool! Let's fish!
          Doug shrugs.

                         DOUG
          Sure. Let's do it.

                         WOODY
          Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down,
          here. I still get a vote on what we do,
          you know? And I want my vote.

                         DOUG
          Okay. Of course you get a vote.
          Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly
          intend to stay.

                         WOODY
          I actually get three votes. Because I
          planned the trip.

                         DOUG
          But you didn't plan the voting system. I
          did. So you only get one. Sorry.
          Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.

                         WOODY
          You know what? Old Doug wasn't such a
          douchebag!

          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          MURDOCK has arrived at the bar, which is just a burned
          shack at this point. The Hell's Angels are gathered
          around, watching JACK beat the crap out of a remaining
          wall with a pipe. He finally stops when the wall has
          crumbled.

                         JACK
          Those assholes think they can cross the
          Hells Angels? Do you know how bad
          they've made us all look!?
          The gang nods. They all look pissed.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Those guys have some balls. Balls I will
          put in my mouth and chew on!!
          The gang looks at Jack with a slight smile. OILCAN
          chuckles.

                         OILCAN
          You're going to put balls in your mouth?
          The gang laughs. Jack realizes what the joke is...

                         JACK
          No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot
          up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm
          going to stick anything I can in their
          asses, and I'm going to enlov it.
          The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Shut up!! I didn't mean-- Just get on
          your damn bikes! We're riding to Lucas!
          The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up
          next to Jack.

                         OILCAN
          Sometimes it helps if you say things in
          your mind first, then say it out loud,
          you know?
          Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a
          dart up out of the ash, and jabs it into his shoulder.

                         OILCAN (CONT'D)
          Oww! Dammit!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 67.

                         JACK
          I did that in my mind, first.
          Jack smiles calmly and walks off.

          EXT. MAIN STREET HOTEL - THAT AFTERNOON

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned
          hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square,
          where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople
          mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on
          the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a
          polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin
          Timberlake's "Rock Your body."

                         PLUMP MAN
          So you grab your girls, And you grab a
          couple more.
          And you all come meet me, in the middle
          of the floor.
          Gonna rock your body! 'Till the break of

                         DAY--
          The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and
          reaches his hand out to the audience, like the star of a
          boy band; However, it's clearly making the people on the
          dance floor uncomfortable.
          Meanwhile, Doug, Bob, Woody and Dudley walk through the
          square and are instantly greeted, patted on the back and
          thanked by each townsperson they pass. The word is out
          that these guys are heroes. Doug gives a "can you
          believe this?" look to the other guys - who are just as
          thrilled as him. They're eating it up.

                         DOUG
          These people love us. This is nuts.

                         BOB
          Yeah. They think we're bad asses.

                         DOUG
          Well, let's not get too carried away with
          it. The truth is we're just regular
          guys. Let's not forget that.

                         DUDLEY
          Yeah, the best thing is to keep a low
          profile. Don't cause any waves. Then if
          somebody pushes us too far, Boom! We go
          Billy Jack upside their heads!

                         WOODY
          You're going to go Billy Jack?

                         DUDLEY
          Nooo. I'm just minding my own business.
          I don't want to cause any trouble.
          Dudley turns to Woody and stares at him. Woody looks
          confused.

                         WOODY

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          What?

                         DOUG
          He's waiting for you to say something
          else, then he's going to kick you.
          Dudley gets a deflated look and backs off of Woody.

                         DUDLEY

                         (TO WOODY)
          Doug just saved you a world of hurt.

                         WOODY
          You're afraid of your cat.

                         DUDLEY
          Yeah, well... He once bit me on the
          sack.
          Dudley walks off towards the beer tent. Woody looks to
          the other guys with a puzzled look.

                         BOB
          It's true. He was unclogging his bathtub
          drain and the cat thought it was a ball
          of yarn.
          Doug and Woody wince.
          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line,
          and realizes he's behind MAGGIE. She smiles at him.

                         MAGGIE
          Hi.
          Dudley is wide-eyed.

                         DUDLEY
          Um... I, uh---

                         (SCRAMBLING)
          What do you call a Mercedes in Harlem?

          Maggie looks confused.

                         MAGGIE
          Excuse me?

                         DUDLEY
          Nothing-- uh...
          Maggie notices the tattoo on Dudley's shoulder.

                         MAGGIE
          Wow. You like macs too, huh? I've got a
          vintage Apple 2e. Restored it from
          scratch.
          Dudley's jaw drops.

                         DUDLEY
          I-- have a cookie jar made out of a 2e.
          For fig newtons.

                         MAGGIE
          Wow. I like fig newtons.
          Dudley collects himself and tries to speak.

                         DUDLEY
          Yeah. They're like fried chicken at a--
          No, that's not... Dammit! This is hard.
          Maggie smiles sweetly as Dudley fumbles.

                         MAGGIE
          You want to dance?
          Dudley goes to respond, then decides to just give an
          emphatic nod. Maggie smiles.

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table,
          drinking beer out of plastic cups. They lean back and
          soak up the small town celebration around them. It's a
          great night.

                         DOUG
          It doesn't get any better than this, huh?
          Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece
          of garlic bread.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 70.

                         BOB
          That's a lot of carbs.
          Doug stops, mid-bite, and puts the bread down.

                         DOUG
          Thanks, Bob. You saved me from all
          that... buttery, garlicky flavor.

                         WOODY
          No he didn't.
          Woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth.

                          WOODY (CONT'D)

                          (MOUTH FULL)
          I did.

                         DOUG
          I hope you choke on it.
          CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and
          BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins -
          identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is
          missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the
          skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.

                         CHARLEY
          Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party!
          These are my deputies: Earl and Buck
          Dooble.
          Earl shakes the guys hands.

                         EARL
          I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember,
          the brother with the word "ear," in his
          name, has both on his head.

                         (LAUGHS)
          I can only say that because I'm on his
          right side. Which as you can see, is
          blown off.
          Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious.

                         BUCK
          I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck
          telling us apart!
          Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing
          ear to the guys. They draw back a little.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 71.

                         DOUG
          Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've
          got a great town here.

                         CHARLEY
          Yeah, we got everything here. Good
          people, good fishing...

                         EARL
          We do have convicted child molesters,
          though. We have to disclose that.

                         CHARLEY
          Not if they don't have kids, Earl.

                         EARL
          Just to be safe, though.
          (yells at crowd of people)
          Hey!! Thomas Milborn!
          A bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks.

                         EARL (CONT'D)

                         (ANNOUNCING)
          Convicted child molester.
          Thomas Milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his
          pockets. The guys look at each other uneasily.

                         BOB
          Well... Still a nice town.

                         WOODY
          If you're not a kid.

                         DOUG
          Or Thomas Milborn.

          ANGLE ON: DANCE FLOOR AREA:
          DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle
          aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of
          Usher's "Yeah." Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively
          for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he
          starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a
          rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and
          shakes his head to the music.
          Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along
          the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet
          and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie
          grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 72.
          ANGLE ON: The Wild Hog's table. The guys sit with
          Charley, Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious
          look.

                         CHARLEY
          Looks like your friend and Maggie are
          hitting it off.

                         DOUG
          Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, Maggie's a great woman.

                         EARL
          Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but
          you know... He's a deformed freak.
          Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley,
          deaf to the conversation.

                         BUCK
          I used to like that girl... but then I
          realized, I can do better.
          The guys look at Buck.

                         CHARLEY
          So, why are you guys taking this road
          trip, anyway?

                         DOUG
          Ahh, just to escape for a bit.

                         WOODY
          Hey, we're not escaping anything, man.
          We're on this trip to live.

                         CHARLEY
          I know what you mean. Sometimes things
          in life can bother you, and sometimes
          nothing in life can bother you. Either
          way, you've got take a break from it.
          Happiness is somewhere between boredom
          and stress.
          Doug is surprised at Charley's insight. So is Woody.

                         WOODY
          Exactly. Which is why we need to keep
          riding until we figure out where that
          happiness is. You don't get old Doug
          back by just staying put.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 73.

                         CHARLEY
          Old Doug?

                         DOUG
          Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't
          sing Bon Jovi anymore.

                         WOODY
          You did lose him, Doug. You know why?
          You're housebroken. You're too
          comfortable. You've got to snap out of
          it!
          Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right.

                         CHARLEY

                         (TO DOUG)
          Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable
          can be a bad thing. You have to wake up
          and slap the bull once in a while.

                         WOODY
          Right! Slap the bull!
          (then, to Charley)
          What?

                         CHARLEY
          Slapping the bull is kind of the local
          test of manhood. It's a way to prove you
          aren't controlled by fear. We've all
          done it.

                         EARL
          Yup. Even torn-open head, here.
          He nods at Buck, on his left.

                         BUCK
          You know, I slapped the bull once.
          Woody smiles slyly. Doug looks concerned.

                         WOODY
          We're slapping the bull.

                         DOUG
          I don't think we need to. I mean, we can
          have our own test of manhood. Let's see
          how many ears of corn we can eat or
          something. I'll start.
          Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody
          just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.

                         WOODY
          We are slapping the bull.
          Doug knows it's no use. He nods, defeated.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. COW PASTURE - THAT EVENING

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL approach a fence
          surrounding a pasture. Charley smiles.

                         CHARLEY
          Here we are. The Lucas test of manhood.
          Slap the bull.
          Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture.
          He's a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns.

                         WOODY
          Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull?

                         EARL
          Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail
          it out of there, because he can kill ya.

                         DOUG
          Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea,
          so... go ahead.
          Woody nods.

                         WOODY
          All right. I'm going in.

                         DOUG / BOB
          You are?

                         WOODY
          Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out
          of that bull. Like, pimp-style.
          The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed.
          Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He
          approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets
          within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard
          on the ass.
          The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but
          Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with
          an exhilarated look on his face.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Whhhheeeeeeew!
          Woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over. The guys
          all applaud.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just
          slapped a big fat bull right on his ass!
          Did you hear how pissed he was!? I just
          pissed of a bull!
          (back to Bull)
          Bitch!
          Woody high fives all the guys.

                         DOUG
          All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that
          bull.
          The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts
          heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the
          fence, watching.

                         WOODY

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          Thanks for bringing us out here. Doug
          really needs this.

                         BOB
          Yeah. This is good for him.

                         CHARLEY
          Sure. Glad we could help.

                         BUCK
          Yeah, and we've never seen it done twice
          in a row. It'll be interesting to see
          how the bull takes being slapped now that
          he's alert.

                         WOODY / BOB
          Alert?
          Woody and Bob look at each other, then to the Bull -
          which Doug is about to slap.

                         WOODY
          Doug, wait!
          It's too late. Doug slaps the bull hard, and turns to
          run.

                          DOUG
          Wheeeeew!! Yeah!
          Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully
          alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into
          an angry charge towards Doug.
          The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on
          Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks
          back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to
          terror.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Ahhhhhhhh!
          It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into
          the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on
          the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and
          starts lining up another charge at him.

                         WOODY
          Oh, no you don't!
          Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull!
          The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Run, Doug! Go!
          Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody.
          Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again.
          The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air.
          Woody lands hard, with a grunt.
          The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob
          jumps over the fence.

                         BOB
          Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of
          this!? Come get this!
          Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and
          starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at
          the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes
          flying past him.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Hah! Missed me, you fat bastard!

          Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry
          towards the fence. Charley and Buck hold a gate open for
          them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up, but
          they've already made it to the gate. They go through and
          Charley shuts it behind them. They lean back on the
          fence, trying to gather their bearings, except Bob - who
          is thrilled.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged
          that stupid cow! How cool am--
          Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's
          butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face
          down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          You son of a bitch! You want to keep it
          going!? You want to take cheap shots!?
          Come on!
          Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys
          restrain him.

                         BOB (CONT'D)

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          Give me your gun! Give me the gun! He
          deserves it!

                         (TO BULL)
          I'll kill you!
          Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down. Doug
          and Woody start to laugh. Bob cools off for another
          moment, then starts laughing as well.

                         WOODY
          No this is living!

                         DOUG
          We just slapped the bull!
          The group high fives each other in congratulations, and
          starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing.
          ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley
          was holding open. The gate swings open.
          ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley
          and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 78.
          Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for
          some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges
          into frame and nails him. As Bob goes flying; we:

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE / BLOCK PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by
          himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss.
          DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the
          bull - but, carrying on happily.

                         WOODY
          Man, did you see the look on Bob's face
          when he got up? Didn't dodge him that
          time!
          Woody and Doug laugh. Bob looks pissed.

                         BOB
          I'm going to go back there with a rifle
          tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off.
          Then we'll see who's tough.

                         DOUG

                         (LAUGHING)
          Why just one leg?

                         BOB
          Because I want to kick him in the face.
          Doug and Woody laugh again. Bob just steams. They spot
          DUDLEY, and head over to him.

                         DOUG
          Hey, Dud. You look happy.

                         DUDLEY
          I danced with her. And she likes macs.
          You know what that means?

                         DOUG
          You have a sister?

                         DUDLEY
          I have a soulmate.

                         DOUG
          I thought you said the color ipod was
          your soulmate.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 79.

                         DUDLEY
          I thought it was. But now, I realize
          that ipod was just a well-designed whore.
          The guys smile. It's been a good night for all of them.

                         DOUG
          Come on. Let's go back to the hotel.
          We've got to get up early to do some
          fishing.
          The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel.

                         WOODY
          Okay, fine. But after fishing - we hit
          the open road and keep moving, okay?

                         DOUG
          Open road, baby!

                         BOB
          Wild Hogs ride!
          The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the
          off-screen rumble of engines. Doug looks down the street
          and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are
          riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any
          second. Woody is frozen with fear.

                         DOUG
          Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going
          to have to talk to these guys again. Get
          them to leave this town alone--

                         WOODY
          Hiiiiiiiidee!
          DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around
          desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels
          are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o-
          potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug,
          Bob and Dudley into it.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Go! Go! Go!
          Woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port-o-potty,
          then gets in with them and shuts the door, just as the
          Hells Angels cruise by them.

          INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

          All four guys are squished inside the port-o-potty like
          sardines.

                         DOUG
          Woody!? What the hell is wrong with--

                         WOODY
          Shhhh! They'll hear you! Don't make a
          sound!

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

          The Hells Angels park their bikes. We see all the
          townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves, and just
          stand there, scared. Jack gets off his bike and looks
          around.

                         JACK

                         (YELLS OUT)
          Good evening, Lucas. Now, as hurt as I
          am that you're having a party and didn't
          invite us... We're only here for one
          reason. The "Wild Hogs." Where the hell
          are they!?

          INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

          Doug looks at Woody. He's starting to figure it out.
          Woody guiltily avoids Doug's glare and watches the Hells
          Angels through a vent in the port-o-potty.

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

          The townspeople aren't saying a word. Jack continues to
          pace in front of the diner.

                         JACK
          Come on, now. You shouldn't be
          protecting them. These "Wild Hogs," not
          only passed us when we specifically told
          them not to, they drained out all our gas
          and burned down our bar. Like the little
          cowards they are. Now where are they!!?

          INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

          Upon hearing this, BOB, DUDLEY and DOUG all look at
          WOODY, who shrugs sheepishly. Bob is enraged.

                         BOB
          You son of a bitch!
          Bob lunges at Woody, but the sudden shifting of weight is
          too much for the port-o-potty...

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

          The port-o-potty tips over. All the Hells Angels turn
          and look as it crashes over on it's side. They continue
          to stare at it curiously.

          INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

          The guys, now on their side, freeze as they see through
          the vent that the Hells Angels are staring at them. It's
          a very tense moment as they wait to see if they've been
          discovered. After a moment, we hear a "glup, glup,
          glup," And the guys smell something curious.

                         BOB

                         (WHISPERING)
          What is that?

                         DUDLEY

                         (WHISPERING)
          It's that blue port-o-potty juice. It's
          coming out of the can.
           The guys all cringe in disgust, but know they can't move.

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack finally turns away from the pot-o-potty and smirks.

                         JACK

                         (TO GANG)
          Now, that's a port-o-potty that ain't
          worth shit.
          The Hell's Angels all laugh and turn back to the diner.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          All right, then. Nobody wants to tell me
          where they are? Fine. Maybe this'll jar
          your memory.
          Jack takes a garbage can and tosses it into the diner
          window. The crowd gasps, as the Hells Angels laugh.
          CHARLEY steps out of the crowd.

                         CHARLEY
          I think they're out at Mckinley's
          pasture. Something about slapping a
          bull. It's up past the lake a ways.
          Jack smiles.

                         JACK
          Good.
          (to Hells Angels)
          Saddle up, boys.
          The guys get on their bikes.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

                         (TO TOWN)
          And if they ain't there. We'll be back
          reeeal soon. Because I don't let any man
          get away from me.
          The gang snickers. Jack realizes;

                         JACK (CONT'D)

                         (TO GANG)
          Shut the hell up! I didn't-- You know
          what I meant!
          Jack starts his bike and roars out of the town. The
          others follow him, gunning their bikes and leaving skid
          marks and smoke in their trail. A kid yells at the Hells
          Angels as they ride out of sight.

                         KIDS
          Go ahead and come back! The Wild Hogs
          aren't afraid you! The Wild Hogs aren't
          afraid of anything!
          Suddenly, the door pops open on the port-o-potty and the
          WILD HOGS topple out of it in a heap. We see they're
          soaked in blue port-o-potty juice.
          They scramble to their feet and run towards the large
          fountain in the middle of the town square.

                         I

          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
          Ahhhh!/ I'm going to vomit!/ Ecchhh!
          The townspeople watch in silence as the guys jump into
          the fountain and try to rinse off.
          Bob puts his head under a water-spouting marble fish.

                         BOB
          It got in my hair! Gross!
          The guys desperately try to rinse off the juice - then,
          drenched from head to toe, turn their glare to Woody.

                         DOUG

                         (TO WOODY)
          You lied, didn't you!? You stood there
          and lied to us!

                         BOB
          You did! You're a stinking liar!

                         WOODY
          I did it for you guys! I wanted you to
          live!

                         DOUG
          Live!? We're going to die, Woody! You
          burned down their bar! We are dead men!

                         DUDLEY
          Oh, man. I thought it was going to
          happen slowly. I thought I had time!
          Dudley sits on the fountain edge and starts to tear up.

                         WOODY

                         (TO GUYS)
          I'm sorry, okay!

                         DOUG
          Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!?

                         WOODY
          Yes, I'm sorry! I just didn't want us to
          go back.

                         DOUG
          Why? It's just a stupid vacation!

                         WOODY
          Because I don't have anything to go back
          to, okay!
          Doug and Bob go silent. Woody looks away - trying to
          collect himself. After a moment, he faces them.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          I've lost everything. The firm fired me,
          Claudia left me... It's all gone. My
          whole life is gone. I don't even have
          enough money to get my lawn raked
          anymore.
          Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep
          breath and continues.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          That's why I couldn't go back. This
          isn't a vacation for me, it's the only
          thing I have left. There's nothing more
          in my life but you guys. So, I lied
          about the Hells Angels. I lied because I
          wanted to have one thing in my life that
          wasn't a complete failure. A real trip
          with my best friends... You're all I
          got. I'm sorry.
          Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a
          minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy.
          Finally, Doug speaks.

                         DOUG
          (realizing, to Woody)
          This trip is just you running from your
          life. Your miserable, screwed up life.

                         (GETTING ANGRIER)
          And you knew you couldn't go back to it,
          so instead you screwed up our lives,
          too... You asshole!
          Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves.

                         WOODY
          Fine! I see how important I am to you
          guys. That's just fine. I just thought
          being a "Wild Hog" meant something!
          Woody takes off his "Wild Hogs" jacket and throws it at
          their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off
          down the street.

          It doesn't mean anything! It's just a
          patch my wife made!!
          Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment,
          they look over to the sidewalk and see:
          ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed
          silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head
          back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their
          heads in disgrace. So much for being heroes.

          INT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT NIGHT

          DOUG stands in the darkened police station with DUDLEY,
          CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL. CHARLEY looks out the window
          with DOUG.

                         CHARLEY
          Looks like they're winding down some.

                         DOUG
          You think?

          EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - CONTINUOUS

          The Hells Angels have returned, and set up shop in the
          diner, but are also flowing out onto the street. Jack
          stumbles into the middle of the road, with a bottle of
          tequila in his hand.

                         JACK

                         (YELLING OUT)
          Alright, Wild Hogs. We know you're in
          town somewhere, 'cause you haven't
          checked out of the hotel. We're a little
          smarter than you thought, huh?

                         OILCAN
          Hell yeah we are!! Wheeew!
          Oilcan smashes a beer can against his own head.

                         JACK
          So we're going to wait right here 'till
          you show up. Weeks, if we have to.
          Hell, we might just make ourselves the
          "Lucas Angels." That has a nice ring to
          it, doesn't it?

          Jack laughs.

          INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

          The guys watch the commotion through the window.

                         DUDLEY
          Crap. I was thinking of that for us.

                         CHARLEY
          You guys just stay in the station
          tonight. No one needs to go out there
          and be a hero and end up getting hurt.

                         DOUG
          Thanks, Charley.
          Charley and the Dooble brothers look a little surprised.

                         CHARLEY
          Wow. So... You're not going out there?
          Doug sighs in irritation.

                         DOUG

                         (SNAPS)
          Well, you're the cop. Why don't you go
          out there?
          Charley is visibly hurt. His lip starts to tremble.

                         CHARLEY

                         (TEARING UP)
          That's not cool, man.
          Charley runs out the back door of the station. EARL
          shakes his head and looks at Doug.

                         EARL
          You know, people have feelings. Sure, I
          make comments about "chum face," here.
          But that's because every time I look at
          him I see parts of his brain. But nobody
          has the right to hurt Charley like that.
          He has both sides of his head.
          Earl storms off, leaving BUCK, who was standing on his
          left and hasn't heard or seen any of them leave. He
          stands there, looking at Doug and Dudley.

          Um... They left.

                         BUCK
          Huh?
          Buck turns and sees Earl and Charley have gone.

                         BUCK (CONT'D)
          Son of a bitch.
          Buck hurries out the door after Charley and Earl.

          INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MORNING

          Doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell. He walks
          out of the cell, and over to the window.
          ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes
          are still parked outside, and the bikers appear to be
          passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out
          front.
          BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach
          the window.

                         DOUG
          They're still out there. Passed out.

                         BOB
          Well, I talked to Karen. She going to
          fly out here, rent a mini-van, and pick
          us up. We'll just ship the bikes back
          later.

                         DOUG
          Bob, we can't leave. They'll just stay
          here and keep terrorizing this town.

                         BOB
          So what? They can call the National
          guard or something.

                         DOUG
          For what? To be stationed here
          permanently? Because these guys will
          just come back when they're gone. And
          it'll be even worse.

                         (MORE)

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          We've created this problem, Bob. We've
          got to think of a way to solve it.

                         BOB
          Well, Karen is really insistent she come
          drive us back.

                         DOUG
          Tell her "no," Bob.
          Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought.

                         BOB
          I can't do that.

                         DOUG
          Well, you're going to have to, Bob!
          We're not going to screw over an entire
          town because you're afraid of women!
          Bob stands up, insulted.

                         BOB
          Oh, sorry I'm not brave like you, Doug!
          The guy who gets injections in his scalp
          so he won't go bald!
          Bob storms out the back door of the police station.
          Dudley looks to Doug, curiously.

                         DUDLEY
          You do?
          Doug shrugs weakly.

                         DOUG
          You know, you can storm out too, if you
          want.

                         DUDLEY
          No, no. I mean, I thought about going to
          see Maggie while those guys are asleep,
          but you need me right now.

                         DOUG
          Thanks, man.
          Doug smiles and gives Dudley a squeeze on the shoulder.
          Dudley is clearly disappointed, having assumed Doug would
          tell him to go see Maggie. Dudley just stands there,
          silent.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          You okay?

          You're always asking me if I'm okay!
          Dudley quickly storms out of the police station. Doug
          nods to himself and slumps down on an office chair.

          EXT. BACK OF POLICE STATION - LATER

          Doug exits and looks around the corner of the building,
          making sure the Hells Angels are still sleeping, then
          starts walking towards a wooded park behind the town.

          EXT. PARK - A MOMENT LATER

          Doug walks through the park, looking depressed. He
          passes through a small playground, and has a seat on a
          bench. He watches all the children play, and his eyes
          fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles
          together. They have cards in their spokes, making engine
          sounds as they ride around having a great time together.
          Doug smiles and watches them play together.

          FADE OUT MUSIC CUE

          BUD (O.C.)
          Thought you might be out here.
          Doug turns and sees BUD, the owner of the diner, Bud has
          a seat next to him.

                         DOUG
          Hey, Bud. Look, I'm sorry we got your
          town in all this trouble. This trip was
          supposed to fix problems, not cause them.

                         BUD
          Well, maybe it's trying to and you just
          won't let it.

                         DOUG
          What do you mean?
          Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing.

                         BUD
          It's the funny thing about life. It has
          to be an adventure to feel right. But
          when you become a husband and a Dad, you
          realize adventure is risk, and a family
          man has no place in his life for risk.
          Doug takes this in, then realizes.

                         DOUG
          You're right. That's why I stopped
          singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a
          risk. That was old Doug. And now it's
          gone. I've taken away all the risk.

                         BUD
          Yup. And if you try to make livin' too
          safe, then it's not livin' at all.

                         DOUG
          It's not. And I have a will, now. So, I
          only have so much livin' left. And
          somehow I've lost the best part of it.

                         BUD
          Well, maybe these will help you find it.
          Bud puts a styrofoam container on Doug's lap. Doug looks
          into it.

                         DOUG
          These are worms.

                         BUD
          Yup. To fish with.

                         DOUG
          I don't get it.

                         BUD
          Friends that screw up. Angry bikers.
          That's not something you should be
          avoiding. That's something you need.
          Doug takes this in.

                         DOUG
          What's that have to do with worms?

                         BUD
          Go down to the lake and find out.

          considering...

          EXT. LAKE - LATER

          Doug walks up to the shore and sees Woody, trying to push
          a canoe towards the water. Woody notices Doug.

                         WOODY
          Hey.

                         DOUG
          Hey. Going fishing?

                         WOODY
          Yup.
          Woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at Doug.

                         DOUG
          I've got worms.

                         (BEAT)
          I mean, in here.
          Doug holds up the styrofoam cup. Woody shrugs.

                         WOODY
          All right. Let's go.
          Doug helps Woody shove the boat out into the water. They
          both hop in as it floats away from the shore. They sit
          there staring off in silence.

                         DOUG
          Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about
          Claudia. And the job.

                         WOODY

                         (STARING OFF)
          Thanks.

                         DOUG
          But, you shouldn't have lied to us--

                         WOODY
          You know what? I screwed up! It
          happens. Maybe from now on I'm better
          off just doing things on my own!
          Woody starts to get up, but then looks at the water
          around him, and sits.

                         (DEFLATED)
          Yeah.
          Doug nods and looks out at the water. They sit there in
          silence for another moment.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          I didn't want to lose, Doug. I've lost
          everything else and I didn't want to lose
          this trip with you guys. When we're
          together, it's like we're all college
          kids still. I'm not a guy with a broken
          marriage and failed career. I'm just
          with my best friends, being happy. And
          to keep it going, I forgot about what
          made it so great... That friends never
          let each other down. Until now. I
          screwed up the last thing I had left.
          You guys deserve better. I'm sorry--
          Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from
          Doug. They sit there for another moment.

                         DOUG
          Well, what's the point of being in a
          motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in
          a little trouble?
          Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          It'll be okay, man.
          Woody smiles a little as well.

                         WOODY
          They won't kill us, right? Just a...
          really bad beating.

                         DOUG
          Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.

                         WOODY
          No way. And how much could a punch
          really hurt? Not much, probably.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 93.

                         DOUG
          Well, the good thing is we'll be able to
          know for sure. That'll be cool.

                         WOODY
          Let's go find the Bob and Dudley.
          Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.

                         DOUG
          Did you bring the paddles?

                         WOODY
          No. I wasn't even going to take this
          thing out, but I didn't want you to think
          I was just standing at the lake waiting
          for you.

                         DOUG
          Why were you here?

                         WOODY
          Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait
          for you.
          Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a
          styrofoam cup.

                         BOB
          Hey, guys.

                         DOUG
          Hey, Bob. Worms?
          Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.

                         BOB
          Are we all good?

                         WOODY
          Yeah, Bob. We're all good.
          Woody smiles at Doug.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          Throw us that paddle.
          Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the
          canoe, but it lands ten yards short and sinks.

                         BOB
          Shit. Hold on.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 94.
          Bob grabs another paddle and throws it. This time it
          lands even shorter. Bob looks around for another paddle.

                         DOUG
          Were those the only two paddles?

                         BOB

                         (BUMMED)
          Yeah.

                         DOUG
          Oh.
          Bob sits down on the grass.

                         BOB
          You guys'll drift in.

                         DOUG

                         (BUMMED)
          Yeah.
          Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still
          as glass. They sit there awkwardly as Bob waits on
          shore.

          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          A cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making
          something in a big pot, as a crowd of townspeople eat in
          the kitchen and dining room. MAGGIE and DUDLEY cross
          through the kitchen, and out to the front porch.

          EXT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          Maggie sits on the porch swing and takes a breath.

                         MAGGIE
          Well, we can't seat many people in there,
          but at least we're back in business.

                         DUDLEY
          Sorry those jerks are in your diner.

                         MAGGIE
          Ah, we're used to them costing us money.
          Last year we spent more on window glass
          than pancake batter. All because of
          them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 95.

                         DUDLEY
          It makes me sick. Thinking they're too
          good for pancakes.

                         MAGGIE
          No, I meant... They damage the diner a
          lot. They damage the whole town. I'm
          just sorry you guys got dragged into it.
          You were just out to have a good
          vacation.
          Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely.

                         DUDLEY
          This has been the best vacation of my
          life. I met you.
          Maggie blushes.

                         MAGGIE
          You bikers probably tell all the girls
          that.
          This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled.

                         DUDLEY
          Maggie, I have to tell you something.
          I'm not really a cool biker or a cool...
          anything. I'm a computer programmer. A
          nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She
          watches me sleep and I don't know why. I
          think she's waiting for me to stop
          breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm
          sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm
          not.
          Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and
          kisses Dudley.

                         MAGGIE
          You're not a geek, Dudley. You're sweet
          and your honest and... You're the
          coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if
          it doesn't like you as much as I do.
          Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Well, I better get back inside. I've got
          to set some chairs up in the family room
          for the lunch rush. People gotta eat.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 96.
          Maggie smiles and heads inside. Dudley watches her go,
          then grits his teeth.

                         DUDLEY
          Oh, people will eat. Don't you worry,
          Maggie. People will eat.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other
          Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on.

                         DUDLEY
          Alright, let's end this!
          The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his
          lip in frustration.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)

                         (YELLS)
          Hey! !
          Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips
          it over. Everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at
          him. Jack stands up and smiles.

                         JACK
          Well, well. One of you came to face the
          music, huh? That's brave. And stupid.
          The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and
          walks up to Jack.

                         DUDLEY
          I'm not here to face any music. I'm here
          to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd
          be smart to take.

                         JACK
          Yeah? What deal?

                         DUDLEY
          You leave the town of Lucas, and my
          friends alone, and I do something for
          you. Something you can't live without.
          Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop
          on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it
          around to show the gang.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 97.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          See where that says "Domain for sale?"
          Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't
          have a website! Nothing! No way to tell
          people about your history, post photos,
          sell shirts... You guys are living in
          the complete dark ages!
          (laughs cockily, then)
          So they way I see it: I need a favor
          from you and you need a favor from me.
          Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a
          moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it
          down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces.
          Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's
          left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is
          starting to look a little nervous.

                         JACK

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          No deal.
          Dudley nods.

                         DUDLEY
          Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out.
          Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move
          over and block his path. Dudley stops and collects
          himself for a moment - then breaks into a panicked sprint
          for the other exit. The Hells Angels quickly spring into
          action and tackle him to the ground.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Sanctuary! Sanctuary!!
          The Hells Angels pull off him, confused.

                         OILCAN
          What?

                         DUDLEY
          Sanctuary. You have to take me to a
          church and leave me alone.
          The Hells Angels look at each other and shrug.

                         OILCAN

                         (TO DUDLEY)
          No we don't.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 98.

                         DUDLEY

                         (DEFEATED)
          I know.
          The Hells Angels move back in on him. Dudley closes his
          eyes and rolls into a ball.

          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          DOUG, BOB, and WOODY are walking back from the lake, and
          pass by Maggie's house. BUD, standing on the porch, sees
          them and smiles.

                         BUD
          If you're heading back to town, I
          wouldn't go on an empty stomach.
          The guys see Bud and smile.

                         BUD (CONT'D)
          Come have lunch. This is kind of our
          "fallout" diner. Smaller kitchen, but
          less piss on the bathroom floor.

                         DOUG
          Well, we can change that.
          Bud laughs as the guys enter the house.

          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at one of many card
          tables arranged in the family room, eating lunch.
          CHARLEY enters through the front door..

                         CHARLEY
          Hey, guys. Having your final meal?
          Charley laughs. Doug, Bob and Woody don't.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

                         BOB

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          Where are Buck and Earl?

                         CHARLEY
          They're coming. Buck's ear is giving him
          some equilibrium problems.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 99.
          EARL ENTERS, holding the door open for BUCK, who walks
          through slowly.

                         EARL

                         (TO BUCK)
          Just keep your eyes forward and head up.

                         BUCK
          I'm fine.
          Buck walks a few more steps, then starts to tilt left.
          He quickly loses his balance and falls sideways, taking
          out a card table full of food and the old man sitting at
          it.

                         EARL
          Goddammit.
          Earl helps Buck up and they join the guys at their table.

                         BUCK
          Hey, guys. Having your final meal?
          Buck and Earl laugh. Nobody else does.

                         CHARLEY
          (sternly, to Buck and Earl)
          That's out of line, guys.

                         EARL
          Sorry.
          Buck looks around the table.

                         BUCK
          Hey, isn't one of you missing?

                         WOODY
          Yeah, Dudley's with Maggie somewhere.
          MAGGIE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN and approaches the table.

                         MAGGIE
          Hey, guys. Where's Dudley?

                         DOUG
          He's with you, isn't he?

                         MAGGIE
          No. I thought he went to find you guys.
          Doug shares a worried glance with Bob and Woody.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 100.

                         DOUG

                         (TO CHARLEY)
          Charley, can I borrow your phone?
          Charley hands it to him, and Doug starts to dial.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Dudley has mine. I'll just call him.

                         WOODY
          He has a phone? What happened to
          freedom?

                         DOUG
          He needed to call his answering machine
          so his cat could hear his voice.

                         (THEN)
          Here we go. It's ringing...

                         (TO MAGGIE)
          He probably snuck off somewhere to buy
          you some romantic gift or something. No
          big deal.

                         BOB
          That's it. He's never had a girlfriend
          so he's probably getting carried away.
          He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte's
          because the Starbucks clerk was smiling
          at him.

                         WOODY
          I remember that. His pee turned brown
          and he started crying.

                         DOUG
          Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling -
          she just had a cleft lip.

          Hello? Dudley?

                         INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SIMULTANEOUS

          Jack stands next to Dudley, who is duct-taped to a chair
          with so much tape that it looks like he's in a cocoon.
          Only his head is uncovered. Jack holds Dudley's
          cellphone.

                         JACK

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Try again, asshole.

          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS


                         DOUG
          (knowingly, to group)
          Nope. The Hells Angels have him.
          Doug gives a look to the other guys. They mouth "Shit:"

          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SIMULTANEOUS


                         JACK

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Damn right, the Hells Angels. Your
          friend paid us a little visit. And now
          he's hurting reeeeal bad.

                         DUDLEY
          No, I actually feel pretty--
          Jack kicks Dudley's chair with his foot. It tips over
          and lands on it's side - with Dudley in it. Dudley looks
          out at the floor, helpless.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Ow!

                         (THEN)
          Hey, a peanut.
          Dudley tries to stick his tongue out to get the peanut.
          Jack notices and kicks it away.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Crap.

                         JACK

                         (INTO PHONE)
          So here's what we're going to do, now.
          You guys are going to pay us a visit.
          And you're going to bring a "disobedience
          fee," of ten thousand dollars. Cash.
          And don't even think about calling any
          cops. Just you guys and ten grand. And
          if you don't show up in an hour - Well
          then, We'll just take the fine out of
          your friend's legs... Which we're going
          to break with a tire iron.

                         DUDLEY
          (yelling to phone)
          Don't bring the money, guys!

                         (MORE)

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          I'm a computer programmer! I don't need
          my legs!
          Jack considers this and turns back to the phone.

                         JACK

                         (INTO PHONE)
          His hands! We'll break his hands!

                         DUDLEY
          Dammit.
          (yelling to phone)
          Bring the money!

          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

          Doug shakes his head at Dudley's stupidity.

                         DOUG

                         (INTO PHONE)
          We'll bring the money. Just don't touch
          our friend!

          INT. BIKER BAR - SIMULTANEOUS


                         JACK

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Oh, I won't touch him if you bring that
          money. But if you don't, I'll be
          touching him all night long. And I'll be
          enjoying it.
          The other bikers suddenly stifle laughter.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          What!? There was nothing wrong with that
          one! That was tough! Those guys are
          afraid of me, now. They know how much I
          want 'em!
          The gang laughs again.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Shut up!!
          The gang stops laughing, off Jack's warning glare.
          Dudley looks up from the floor.

                         DUDLEY
          Hey can we call my cat, now? She needs
          to hear my voice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 103.
          Jack looks down at Dudley, then to the other bikers.

                         JACK

                         (TO BIKERS)
          Get me more duct tape?
          A biker nods and grabs another role of duct tape. He
          heads over to Dudley.

                         DUDLEY
          Crap.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG sits in a chair, deep in thought. BOB, WOODY, EARL,
          BUCK, and BUD stand with other members of the town.
          MAGGIE is on a couch, sobbing into her hands.

                         MAGGIE

                         (CRYING)
          Sweet Dudley. He went there to save
          everybody and now they're going to break
          his hands.

                         DOUG
          No they aren't. We're going to get him
          back.

                         CHARLEY
          We sure are. I'm going to call the
          Highway Patrol. They'll be there in--

                         BOB
          No way. They said no law. We can't risk
          them doing anything to Dudley.

                         WOODY
          Bob's right. We can call the Highway
          Patrol after we get Dud back, but we
          shouldn't piss these guys off while he's
          still in their hands.

                         BOB
          I'm going to call Karen and have the cash
          wired out of our savings.

                         WOODY
          No. No way. This is my fault. All this
          is my fault. I have some money in my
          severance package. We're using it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 104.

                         MAGGIE
          Wait, he did this because of me. I have
          a thousand dollars in tip money I want to
          put in.

                         BUD
          I have a couple thousand in the diner
          emergency fund I'll put in, too.
          Doug, who has been thinking all this over, stands up from
          his chair.

                         DOUG
          No. Nobody is paying anything.
          Everyone stops and gives Doug a puzzled look. He has a
          new fire behind his eyes. His suburban quietude has
          transformed into something more... valiant.

                         WOODY
          What?

                         DOUG
          We're not calling the Highway patrol.
          We're not gathering ten thousand dollars.
          We're going over there and getting our
          friend back.

                         CHARLEY
          I don't think that's the safest plan.

                         DOUG
          It's not. But sometimes you have to do
          the things that aren't safe, to create a
          world that you're happy being in. These
          Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand
          dollars. They want our dignity. They
          want us to be afraid of them just like
          this town is. And once they know we're
          afraid, they can do whatever they want.
          That's how these guys exist. That's how
          they ride into this town and tear it to
          pieces... Because people want to keep
          their lives safe so badly, they give up
          the best part about it...
          Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          .The adventure.
          Doug looks at Woody and Bob. Woody smiles and pulls on
          his jacket.

                         WOODY
          And the friends.
          Woody steps over to Doug. Bob looks at them for a
          moment, then finally smiles and pulls on his jacket.

                         BOB
          Let's go slap the bull.
          Doug smiles and taps fists with Bob and Woody.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER


          MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT'S "(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER."
          DOUG, BOB and WOODY walk along main street, shoulder to
          shoulder. They look to each other with a smile. Even
          though they're walking into the mouth of the beast,
          they're finally who they were in college again.
          Fearless. They approach the diner and stand out on the
          street, like gunslingers in the Old West, calling their
          enemy out of the saloon.

          MUSIC CUE: FADE OUT
          The front door of the bar opens and the HELLS ANGELS
          swagger out. After a moment, the gang parts and JACK
          steps out in front of them.

                         JACK
          Well, well. The "Wild Hogs." I'm glad
          to see you're finally showing us a little
          respect.

                         DOUG
          Where's Dudley?
          Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels.
          They push DUDLEY forward. We see he is now completely
          cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy. There is only a
          small slit for his mouth and eyes.

                         DUDLEY
          (muffled from tape)
          Hey, guyth.
          Doug shakes his head.

                         DOUG
          Just hold tight, Dudley.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 106.
          Dudley tries to nod, but can't. He leans his torso back
          and forth to signal "yes."

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JACK)
          All right. Hand him over.

                         JACK
          Sure. Where's the cash?
          Doug looks to Bob and Woody. They nod encouragingly.
          Doug gathers his courage and turns back to Jack.

                         DOUG
          We're not giving you any money.
          Jack looks surprised.

                         JACK
          Excuse me?

                         DOUG
          We're not going to play your games.
          We're all adults, here. It's not
          highschool. I'm sorry your bar got
          burned down, and we'll be glad to help
          you get it rebuilt, but we're done being
          bullied by you. Now give us back Dudley,
          and get out of this town.
          The Hells Angels start to laugh. Jack turns back to them
          and smiles, "Can you believe these guys?" Doug is
          starting to lose his cool.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          (yells to Jack)
          Give us back our friend, asshole!
          The Hells Angels are suddenly silent. Jack turns back
          and looks at Doug in disbelief - then rage. Doug starts
          to look a little worried.

                         JACK
          What did you just call me?

                         DOUG
          (losing some confidence)
          Ass... hole.

                         JACK
          You know what? I was just going to
          pulverize your friend, here.

                         (MORE)

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          But now I'm pissed off. You're all going
          to get hurt. Hells Angels style. Guys!
          The Hells Angles nod and pick up various weapons:
          Crowbars, tire irons, bats... They start moving towards
          Doug, Woody and Bob. Bob looks to Doug.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          What!? I thought they'd back down!

                         WOODY
          We can still outrun them. They're fat.
          Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in
          behind them, blocking their escape. Jack smiles.

                         JACK
          Hear that, guys!? He called you all fat!

                         WOODY
          shit.
          (to Hells Angels)
          I meant full-figured.
          The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the "Wild
          Hogs," and raise their weapons to strike.

                         DOUG
          Wait!! Wait a minute!
          The Hells Angels stop.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JACK)
          You want to beat the shit out of us?
          Fine. But you outnumber us forty to
          three. You think there's honor in that?
          Why don't we make it fair, if you guys
          are so freaking tough? The leader of our
          gang against the leader of yours.
          Jack smirks. He's twice as big as Doug.

                         JACK
          Me against you?

                         DOUG
          Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you
          win, we'll give you ten grand and go back
          home. You'll never see us again. But...
          If I win, you let Dudley go and you never
          set foot in Lucas again. This town is
          off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 108.
          Jack looks back to the Hells Angels, who chuckle. This
          will be a quick fight.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Well? You in, or are you too much of a
          bitch?
          The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage
          and turns back to Doug.

                         JACK
          All right. Let's party, tough guy.

                         DOUG
          Great.
          Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly
          fading away.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (UNSURE)
          Great.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          DOUG and JACK are standing "in their corners," opposite
          each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded
          by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the
          fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his
          corner.

                         WOODY
          Just stay clear of the big punches.
          You've got more stamina than this guy.

                         DOUG
          All right. When do I hit back?

                         WOODY
          Um... Just try and get him tired. I
          don't think punches will do much to him.
          Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack
          steps into the circle and throws off his jacket.

                         JACK

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Time for your beating, yuppie!

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a
          truck.
          Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JACK)
          All right. Let's do this--
          Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a
          punch on the side of his head. Doug is stunned, as Jack
          sends his other fist crashing into Doug's forehead. Doug
          goes flying backwards, and falls down in the dirt. The
          Hells Angels cheer. Jack high fives them as Doug
          struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and
          Bob, cradling his face.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!

                         (TO WOODY)
          It really hurts. Damn!
          Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right,
          but this time Doug ducks, still cradling his jaw.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Yes!--
          But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's
          other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony.
          Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty.
          Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him
          into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug
          five yards into the dirt.

                         JACK
          Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just
          beginning.
          Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He
          slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand.

                         DOUG
          Hah!
          Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's
          face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the
          chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his
          head.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Damn.
          Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug
          crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the
          Hells Angels.

                         JACK
          Man, this isn't even a workout.
          Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as
          Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him.

                         DOUG
          Ahhh!
          Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims
          carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand
          bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and
          waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train
          into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines
          up another punch.

                         JACK
          This one's gonna break bone.

                         DOUG
          Wait! Wait--
          Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal
          abscess.

                         JACK
          What?

                         DOUG
          look, I really hate you, but I don't want
          to feel responsible for a death. I'm a
          dentist. I took an oath. Same one as
          doctors. If the infection in that tooth
          gets to the root - it could seep into
          your nervous system. Just let me look--
          Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't
          move.

                         JACK
          You're a dentist?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 111.

                         DOUG
          Yeah. One of the best. And I know when
          your gums are that swollen and your

                         BICUSPID--
          And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack
          goes down hard. Woody and Bob cheer.

                         BOB
          Yeah, Doug!

                         WOODY
          Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him
          get up!
          Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot
          and pushes him backwards. Doug falls back to the dirt.
          Jack stands up and dusts himself off.

                         JACK
          All right. Now you're going to die.
          Jack approaches Doug, who closes his eyes and waits for
          the end.

                         WOODY
          Wait!!
          Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.

                         WOODY (CONT'D)
          Doug's not the leader of this gang. I--
          Jack instantly punches Woody in the face. Woody falls
          down next to Doug. Doug turns his head to Woody.
          They're both bleeding from their noses and lips.

                         DOUG

                         (TO WOODY)
          Thanks, man.

                         WOODY
          Sure.
          Jack looks at Bob.

                         JACK
          Anybody else the leader of this gang?
          Bob takes a deep breath, and bends down an grabs a long
          lead pipe. He starts towards Jack.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 112.

                         BOB
          Alright, Mother f--
          Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground.
          Doug shakes his head.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BOB)
          Just stay down.
          Bob nods.

                         JACK
          Well, I guess that's all of you--
          DUDLEY, still covered in tape, comes running into the
          circle from the other side.

                         DUDLEY
          Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
          Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not
          in a tackle, but in him leaning on Jack. After a moment,
          Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground.

                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Ow.
          Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN.

                         JACK
          Give me the crowbar.
          Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack. Jack smiles at the
          four fallen Wild Hogs.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Guess you guys are wishing you'd
          listened, now, huh?
          Jack smiles as we hear:

                         SFX: SIREN
          Jack and the Hells Angels look up the road.
          ANGLE ON: DOWN STREET. CHARLEY is riding his shiny
          Harley Davidson police bike. Behind him are BUCK and
          EARL, driving a police cruiser. Behind the cruiser is a
          large group of people carrying rakes, hedge clippers,
          brooms... It's all the citizens of Lucas.
          ANGLE ON: Hells Angels. They're stunned.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 113.
          CHARLEY pulls up to the group and gets off his
          motorcycle.

                         CHARLEY
          All right, Jack. That'll be enough of
          that.

                         JACK
          Are you kidding? And what makes you
          think you can ride a motorcycle without
          our permission?

                         CHARLEY
          I'll ride whatever I want from now on.
          I'm the sheriff of Lucas, and I'm not
          tolerating any more lawlessness.
          BOB helps DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY to their feet, as Jack
          takes a step towards Charley.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          I'd stop right there, Jack.
          Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns.
          They cock the guns and walk to Charley's side. Jack
          looks concerned.

                         JACK
          What? You're going to shoot us?

                         CHARLEY
          No. Not unless you want to do something
          stupid like ignoring--
          Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his
          balance. He tips over and falls. As he hits the ground,
          the shotgun fires and hits OILCAN in the leg. Oilcan
          falls to the ground.

                         OILCAN
          Ahhhhhh! He shot me! I just got shot!!
          Charley looks over at Buck, then back to Jack.

                         CHARLEY
          Um... Yeah, I guess we're going to shoot
          you.
          The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous, and back up a few
          steps. Charley steps towards Jack.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 114.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          We're not going to live in fear of your
          gang anymore, Jack. If the Wild Hogs can
          stand up to you - so can everyone of us.
          The crowd of townspeople gathers behind Charley and nods.

                         BUD

                         (FROM CROWD)
          That's right. You mess up our town,
          we'll do the same to you!
          The crowd cheers as THOMAS MILBORN, the guy Earl pointed
          out as a child molester, steps forward.

                         THOMAS MILBORN
          Yeah! People like you are the scum of
          the earth!
          The crowd is silent for a moment, then hesitantly gives a
          uncomfortable cheer. Charley turns back to the Hells
          Angels.

                         CHARLEY
          The point is, from now on you need to
          treat Lucas with kindness and respect.
          And when you do, you'll be treated the
          same. And if you don't...
          Charley looks over at OILCAN, who's tending to the bullet
          wound in his thigh.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          Then I guess we'll keep... shooting you.
          Got it?
          Jack looks at all the townspeople. He knows he's beaten.
          He nods bitterly.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          Good. Now I'd like you to untape our
          friend Dudley.
          Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels. He grabs
          Dudley's tape and spins him around to untape him.

                         DUDLEY
          Ow. Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. Ow!...
          After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks
          at Jack's jacket.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 115.

                         CHARLEY
          And I believe that's his jacket.
          Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket
          and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on.

                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
          And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was
          traded to Dudley.
          Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and
          shakes his head.

                         JACK
          No way. He can have his Sportster back.

                         CHARLEY
          Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack.
          Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley.
          The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51
          Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times
          and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare.

                         JACK

                         (TO DOUG)
          Hope you're happy. You suburban posers
          are a disease. You need to learn some
          damn respect for real bikers.
          Doug smiles.

                         DOUG
          You still don't get it do you, Jack?

                         JACK
          Get what?

                         DOUG
          We are the real bikers.
          As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and
          shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes
          into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes

                         DUDLEY LOOKS
          as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap.
          up from the ground.

                         DUDLEY
          Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I
          guess.

          Jack just stares at the trashed motorcycle, mortified.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY
          walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK.

                         CHARLEY
          Well, I wish you guys would stay longer.

                         DOUG
          Ahh, we should be heading back. I think
          we've had enough excitement for one trip.
          Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.

                         EARL
          You guys were a blessing to this place.
          I mean... I'm not going to get all
          emotional like "hamburger head" here
          always does.
          Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He
          quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him
          in disbelief.

                         BUCK
          What'd you just call me?

                         EARL

                         (CAUGHT)
          Um...

                         BUCK
          It's just a little scar! I'm still
          better looking than you!
          Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left
          and falls over.

                         BUCK (CONT'D)

                         (FROM GROUND)
          Dammit!
          Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob.

                         DOUG
          (to Woody and Bob)
          You guys ready to head back?

          Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head.

                         WOODY
          You know what? I think I'm going to
          press on. Keep heading West.

                         DOUG
          You are?

                         WOODY
          Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my
          life again. And I'd like to see what San
          Francisco's all about.
          Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.

                         BOB
          I'm in, too! Let's ride to San--
          Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.

                          BOB / DOUG
          Karen? / Kelly?

                         KAREN

                         (TO BOB)
          I told you I was coming, Bob!

                         KELLY

                         (TO DOUG)
          Hey, honey.
          Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her.

                         DOUG
          Hey, baby. What are you doing here?

                         KELLY
          Karen said you guys were in trouble. I
          kept calling your cell, but somebody
          programmed it to not receive calls from
          our house.
          Doug shoots Woody a look.

                         WOODY

                         (CAUGHT)
          Excuse me.
          Woody hurries over to his bike. KAREN turns to BOB.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 118.

                         KAREN
          Well, I hope you guys had a nice trip.
          Now get in the van. We're going home.

                         BOB
          Um... Actually, we just decided we were
          going to keep pressing West for a few--

                         KAREN
          Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out
          here, rented a car, drove to this podunk

                         LITTLE TOWN--
          As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then
          back to Karen. He can't take it anymore.

                         BOB
          --Karen!
          Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.

                         BOB (CONT'D)
          Listen to me. This is My vacation and if
          I want to ride on with my friends, well
          that's what I'm going to do! And if you
          have a problem with that, well... Tough
          shit!
          There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The
          guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds,
          Karen's face softens.

                         KAREN

                         (SUDDENLY MEEK)
          Okay. Sorry... Just... be careful.
          Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe
          it.

                         BOB
          I will. And... I love you.
          Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike.
          ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY. Kelly looks at Doug.

                         KELLY
          So are you going, too?

                         DOUG
          I hadn't really decided. I have been
          having a good time, though.

                         (MORE)

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (SMILES)
          I even got beaten up.
          Doug winks cockily. Kelly lights up.

                         KELLY
          There he is! I saw old Doug!
          Doug blushes.

                         DOUG
          You'll see him even more if you and Billy
          meet me in San Francisco. We've got a
          suite at the Ritz-Carlton.
          Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks
          concerned.

                         KELLY
          What about work? And Billy's school?
          Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world.

                         DOUG
          Ahh. We can risk it.
          Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face
          and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          We ready?

                         WOODY
          I think so. Dudley? What do you think?
          The camera PULLS OUT to reveal DUDLEY, sitting on his
          motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty
          sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing
          Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley
          looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody.

                         DUDLEY
          Let's ride.
          They start their motorcycles. The engines roar to life.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY

          The four motorcycles (and one sidecar) cruise down the
          open highway. The guys smile as the wind blows in their
          faces.

          It's freedom, joy and friendship all wrapped up in one
          expression. The camera PANS AROUND THEM, and finally
          ZOOMS IN ON DOUG. We see his eyes sparkle a little bit,
          and he opens his mouth:

                         DOUG

                         (SINGING)
          I walk these streets, a loaded six string
          on my back.
          I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make
          it back...
          I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride!
          I'm wanted...
          The other guys smile and join in:

          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
          Dead or alive!
          They all look at each other as they continue to sing over
          the roar of the engines:

          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY (CONT'D)
          Ohh, I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my
          side!

                         I'M WANTED--

                         DOUG
          Wante-ee--ed!

          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY
          Dead or aliiiivvvee!

          MUSIC CUE: BON JOVI'S "WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE."
          The camera slowly PULLS OUT TO AN AERIAL SHOT, as the
          guys joyfully ride along the sunlit highway.
          It's a good day to be a Wild Hog.

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

             Don't bother us now, honey -- this old
             incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to
             lose a lot of our chicks.

             Oh, but he doesn't do it every day --
             just once or twice a week. And he can't
             catch her old cat, anyway. And now she

          It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

                    DOROTHY
          Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss
          Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old
          cat --

                    ZEKE
          Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

                    HUNK
          Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your
          head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't
          have any brains at all.

                    DOROTHY
          I have so got brains.

          Well, why don't you use them? When you
          come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's
          place. Then Toto won't get in her
          garden, and you won't get in no trouble.
          See?

                    DOROTHY
          Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's
          all.

          kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a
          poor sour-faced old maid that -- she
          ain't got no heart left. You know, you
          should have a little more heart yourself,
          and have pity on her.

                    DOROTHY
          Well, gee, I try and have a heart.

          have no more dust storms. Can you imagine
          what it'll mean to this section of the
          country? I'll show you. It works
          perfectly now. Here's the principle. You
          see that fan -- that sends up air
          currents into the sky. These air currents
          -- Oh, stop it!

          Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in

          scared to pieces!

          I couldn't say. But even if he didn't,
          you'd be no worse off than you are now.

                    SCARECROW
          Yes -- that's true.

                    DOROTHY
          But maybe you'd better not. I've got a
          witch mad at me, and you might get into
          trouble.

          I don't blame you for that.

          But I'd face a whole box full of them for

SNOW WHITE'S VOICE

Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

          delusion that simply because you run away
          from danger, you have no courage. You're
          confusing courage with wisdom. Back

          their fortitude out of mothballs and
          parade it down the main street of the

       GUN BARREL LOGO OPENS ON

       GENEVA SWITZERLAND, an unnaturally clean city that melds old
       Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source.

       INT. HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

       An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private
       banking institute" within.

       INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY

       JAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by
       three THUGS in Armani suits.  They remove A GUN from inside
       his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them
       on the desk that separates Bond and...

       LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him,
       three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.

                           LACHAISE
                 Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond,
                 but you understand, a man in my
                 position..

                           BOND
                 Which is neutral, no doubt.

       Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped.  Gestures for
       Bond to sit.

       A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped
       suit.  She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of
       EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond.

                           LACHAISE
                 It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the
                 money.  No doubt Sir Robert will be
                 pleased to see it again.

       The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond,
       setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good
       deal of CASH in pound sterling.

                           LACHAISE
                 In the current exchange rate, minus the
                 fees, of course, and certain
                 unforeseeable expenses. Here is the
                 receipt...

       The CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT...

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 Would you like to check my figures?

                           BOND
                 Perhaps later.

       She steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the
       desk...the THUGS TENSE...

                           BOND
                 My glasses.

       Lachaise nods.  Bond can have his glasses.

       He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd
       number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:

       3,030,303.03.

                           LACHAISE
                 It's all there.

       Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he
       removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise.

                           BOND
                 I didn't come for the money. The report
                 you sold him was stolen from an MI-6
                 agent, who was killed for it.

       He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk.

                           LACHAISE
                 I did not get the report from an MI-6
                 agent.

                           BOND
                 Who did you get it from?

                           LACHAISE
                 I am just a middle man. I am doing the
                 honourable thing and returning the money
                 to its rightful owner...

                           BOND
                 And we know how difficult that can be for
                 the Swiss.

                           LACHAISE
                     (controlled fury)
                 Your last chance. Take the money.

                           BOND
                 Your last chance. Give me the name.

                           LACHAISE
                 Stripped of all your weaponry, you still
                 threaten me?

       He nods.  An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...

                           BOND
                 Perhaps you failed to take into account
                 my...hidden assets.

       Bond's mouth edges into a smile.  A flicker of doubt on
       Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the
       tiny arm of his glasses and...

       KABOOM!  The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those
       around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief
       effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his
       opening...

       He KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun.
       Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW
       just as they're getting their bearings.  Now he nestles the
       barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's
       cheek.

                           BOND
                 The name?

                           LACHAISE
                 I can't tell you...
                     (Bond cocks the gun)
                 Alright, alright! But you must protect
                 me!

       And he freezes.  The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking
       out of his neck.  Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR
       GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF.

       Bond rushes to the window...

       EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY

       She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly
       disappearing into shadows.

       Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to...

       THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door,
       casually slipping that cigar into his pocket...

       Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in
       hand.  He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT
       appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet
       zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart.

       Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.

       INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY

       Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by
       the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the
       stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below.

       Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into
       the lift shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it
       comes down.  Almost nonchalant, he steps out...

       INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

       As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the
       counterweight, DESCENDING.

       EXT. STREET - GENEVA

       Lunchtime.  Faceless business crowds heading for their brief
       moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,
       with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,
       troubled.

       INT. HOTEL - GENEVA - DAY

       The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she
       approaches a BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the
       city.  Propped against the doorframe, an assassin's RIFLE
       with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod,
       trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining
       the shattered office windows.

       The man turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut.
       There is a raised, red scar of an ENTRY WOUND at his temple.
       It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,
       like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems
       slightly drooping, deadened. The other eye is sharp and black
       as anthracite.  It is a frightening face. This is RENARD.

                           RENARD
                 What's his name? Our friend from MI-6?

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 James Bond.

                           RENARD
                 One of M's more accomplished tin
                 soldiers.

                           CIGAR GIRL
                 He could identify me.

                           RENARD
                 If it concerns you...kill him.

       He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two
       glasses of wine.

                           RENARD
                 Let's toast this James Bond.  We're in
                 his hands now...

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - LONDON - DAY

       A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome, banks along the
       snaking river.

       EXT. MI-6 - LONDON - DAY

       Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the
       vast stepped cake that is MI-6.  Bond exits with the
       suitcase.

       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - DAY

       CAMERA MOVES with Bond as he enters this secret, hi-tech
       world.  He passes through countless security procedures,
       watched by an attentive staff.

       Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase.  Three million
       sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight.  He
       flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it down
       wistfully.  A blue light scans it on three axis.

       The money is bundled into a clear plastic bag, put on a tray
       and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the
       SECURE ROOM.  Bond hands the suitcase to a STAFF MEMBER.

                           BOND
                 Have this checked, see what you can get
                 off it.

       INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY

       Bond appears, hiding something behind his back.  Moneypenny
       brightens.

                           MONEYPENNY
                 James.  Brought me a souvenir from
                 Geneva?

       He produces the cigar, now in a large phallic TUBE.  Stands
       it end up on the desk.

                           BOND
                 Thought you might want one of these.

                           MONEYPENNY
                     (beat, deadpan)
                 I gave up a long time ago.
                     (nods to M's door)
                 She's in with Sir Robert.

       INT. M'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY

       Bond enters.  SIR ROBERT KING is perched on the edge of M's
       desk.  Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.

                           M
                 Sir Robert King, James Bond.

       King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile. Bond
       notes a TINY BADGE in his lapel -- like the glass eye of a
       stuffed snake.

                           SIR ROBERT
                 Thanks for getting my money back --never
                 expected to see it again.  You're the
                 kind of man I could use.  Though I won't
                 offend certain parties by asking you to
                 join King Industries.

       King looks to M, smiling.

                           BOND
                 Construction's not exactly my line.

                           M
                 Quite the opposite, in fact.

       She couldn't resist. King smiles at Bond.  As he goes, he
       gives M a respectful kiss on the cheek. The door closes.  M
       turns.

                           BOND
                 Old friend?

                           M
                 Since Oxford. I knew him when he had
                 nothing but a brilliant mind and enough
                 guts to conquer the world. He's a man of
                 great integrity.

                           BOND
                 Who buys classified reports for three
                 million pounds.

       M picks up the report from her desk.  Bond notices it is in
       Russian, with a SEAL from a Russian military agency in the
       corner: MIRATOM.

                           M
                 It's a report on weapons security in the
                 former Soviet Union, which, as you know,
                 is shaky at best.  He's had several
                 instances of sabotage at the pipeline,
                 and he's understandably concerned. He
                 called me the moment he realized its
                 sensitive nature.

       She pours a scotch for Bond.  He drops some ice in,
       thoughtful.

                           BOND
                 Someone was watching over me in Geneva.
                 A guardian angel with a laser sight.

       He stops, rubs his thumb and forefinger together -- a strange
       SIZZLING where he touched the ice.  Realization sinks in.

                           BOND
                 King.

       M sees the seriousness in his eyes -- stabs at the intercom:

       Moneypenny's eyes shoot to the intercom console:

       Sir Robert King and an MI-6 AIDE walk toward SECURITY.

       INT. Q DIVISION, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Q and his men are working on a strange half-built BOAT
       suspended over a water tank.

                           Q
                 ..the hydro boat can operate in three
                 inches of water...

       He looks up as Bond runs through...

       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       THE MONEY lies on the tray, wrapped in plastic.

       Sir Robert approaches, two rows of security bars between him
       and the cash.  An official produces a bag and moves toward
       it:

                           SIR ROBERT
                 Thanks, but I'll count it myself.
                     (apologetic, smiles)
                 Lifetime habit.  I'm Scottish.

       INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Bond shoots around the corner just in time to see Sir Robert
       disappearing past the THICK STEEL DOOR of the secure room.

                           BOND
                 Stop!  King!

       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       The shout is muffled, Sir Robert's more interested in the
       money.

       He continues toward camera, that PIN on his lapel emits a
       serene HUM and we

       KABOOM!  A MASSIVE EXPLOSION.

       INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       MAYHEM.  FIRE blasts out of the open doorway just as Bond
       reaches it.  The STEEL DOOR flies toward him.  He dives --

       EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

       The building rocks.  SMOKE is pouring from a HOLE that's
       appeared in a lower tier. A wall and a section of roof gone.

       EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

       A figure staggers out, shaken.  Catching his breath.  BOND.

                                                            CUT TO:

       ECU CIGAR GIRL

       Lining up Bond with her infra-red telescopic sight.

       ANGLE ON BOND

       In the swirling dust and smoke, he suddenly sees a wand of
       red light, pointing at his chest.

       All instinct, he dives for cover.  Powerful, high velocity
       bullet hits blanket the area.  Bond prepares to return fire,
       scanning around for the source. Through the debris he spots
       an unusual, hi-tech BOAT on the river -- long and narrow and
       low.  A figure on board.  THE CIGAR GIRL.

       ANGLE ON CIGAR GIRL

       She FIRES OFF A ROUND OF SHOTS, forcing Bond back into cover.
       Then she guns the engines and SPEEDS OFF down the Thames.

       EXT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Determined, Bond races back into the wreckage...

       INT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

       Bond races through the chaos that is MI-6 and into...

       Q DIVISION

       Where he leaps into the prototype BOAT.  Q protests...

                           Q
                 It's not finished!

       Bond looks at the mystifying number of buttons and gadgets
       ...presses something red and...THE BOAT LEAPS OUT, ENGINE
       ROARING...

       EXT. SLIPWAY - RIVER - DAY

       THE 007 THEME KICKS IN AS:

       JAMES BOND, in the Q boat, SHOOTS OUT of the MI-6 rubble and
       onto the Thames.

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

       Bond can see the Cigar Girl up ahead...he is closing the
       distance.  She catches sight of him in pursuit...

       EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY

       She pushes the boat to its limit, it roars to a new level of
       speed...the chase is on.

       EXT. THAMES - DAY

       Police speedboats, alerted by the commotion, trail Bond.

       ON THE EMBANKMENT

       Police cars scream alongside, sirens wailing.

       ON THE THAMES

       Bond is losing ground as he and the Cigar Girl weave through
       traffic on the Thames. In a gutsy bid to keep pace, he
       corrals the Q boat into a hair-raising SHORT-CUT, shooting
       off...

       UNDERNEATH A PIER

       He maneuvers the boat under the low pier and emerges EVEN
       CLOSER to his prey...

       EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY

       The Cigar Girl stops her boat, moving to the back, manning
       her large, rear-mountain MACHINE GUN and taking aim at
       Bond...

       EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

       Bond continues at full speed, fearless in the hail of bullets
       ricocheting off the vessel.

       THE CIGAR GIRL Remains calm and cool, shooting with
       precision.

       BOND closes in...

       CIGAR GIRL'S eyes widen as...

       BOND STEERS HIS BOAT RIGHT OVER THE MACHINE GUN AND TURRET...

       Cigar Girl dives out of the way, as her boat becomes a RAMP,
       LAUNCHING the Q boat INTO THE AIR before it dives, nose-
       first, into the Thames.

       EXT. - CIGAR GIRL BOAT - CONTINUOUS

       CIGAR GIRL gets up from the deck and sees BOND, turning his
       boat to close in for the kill...

       She scrambles to the helm and SPEEDS OFF, seeing ahead of
       her...

       TOWER BRIDGE

       Just beginning to open, to allow for passage of a small
       tanker.

       EXT. CIGAR GIRL BOAT

       She streaks toward the bridge, Bond lagging behind...

       ON BOND

       As he looses her boat in the distance, he makes a DESPERATE
       MOVE...he cranks the wheel of his boat and veers off, UP A
       SLIPWAY and into...

       EXT. FISH MARKET

       Where the boat hydroplanes on masses of surface water and
       propels him into

       EXT. LONDON STREET

       The hurtling boat causes mayhem and panic as he wrestles with
       the controls, jetting off the street and straight toward...

       EXT. RIVERSIDE RESTAURANT

       Bond's boat crashes right through it, sending diners LEAPING
       in every direction. The Q boat SHOOTS OUT over the balcony
       and splashes down once more into...

       EXT. THAMES - DAY

       Cigar Girl is now clearly in his sights.  She is amazed to
       see that Bond has managed to overtake her.

       The racing boats dice through an armada of lazy, over-loaded
       BARGES, nearly crashing into the much larger vessels.

       AT EVEN PACE NOW...Cigar Girl attempts to force her way past
       him, but Bond, punching buttons on the console of the Q-boat,
       releases a set of catapulting FLAME CANNISTERS which create a
       massive WALL OF FIRE ahead of them...

       CIGAR GIRL is forced toward the very edge of the river...the
       jig is almost up, and then...

       HER P.O.V.  She spots the launching of a HOT AIR BALLOON from
       the base of the massive MILLENNIUM DOME.

       She skids her vessel to a stop at a nearby pier and quickly
       scrambles out of her boat.

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY

       ...A crowd around a RICHARD BRANSON-like figure about to
       climb into his HOT AIR BALLOON.

       The Cigar Girl, brandishing her gun, forces her way through
       the crowd and LEAPS INTO THE BALLOON CARRIAGE, just ready to
       lift off.  She cranks open the gas nozzles and the balloon
       rises with surprising speed.

       EXT. BOND'S BOAT - DAY

       Bond steers his craft toward a slipway adjacent to the pier
       and SHOOTS UP INTO THE AIR...

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME

       An amazing sight...Bond's boat sailing through the air just
       beneath the balloon.  With split second precision he reaches
       up and GRABS ONE OF THE ROPES dangling down from the balloon.

       Bond finds himself being CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR as his boat
       falls away from him, hitting the ground and ERUPTING into a
       ball of flame.

       EXT. HOT AIR BALLOON - CONTINUOUS

       As Bond is carried higher and higher, the Cigar Girl begins
       FIRING AT HIM over the edge of the carriage.

       Bond, with ONE HAND, returns fire.

       CIGAR GIRL then leans over the edge of the carriage and
       begins to SLICE THE ROPE that Bond is hanging from.

       The fibers split and fray away from each other as...

       BOND FALLS, heading straight toward...

       THE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over.

       AS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still
       FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas
       tank...

       EXT. BALLOON - DAY

       The BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar
       Girl with it...

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY

       Bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of
       the Millennium Dome breaking his fall.

       EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME ROOF - DAY

       He slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps
       of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF
       THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON...

       THE GROUND BELOW

       He struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to
       his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky
       as we zero in on the iris of...

       HIS EYE

       reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the
       screen transforms into...

       THE MAIN TITLES

       BAGPIPES.  A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters
       of Loch Lomond.

       A long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial
       service.  They mill about on the lawn, among them,  M, grim-
       faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in
       a black sling.

       Bond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd...

       HIS P.O.V.  It's like a state funeral.  Rich and powerful
       people, government ministers, chief executives from around
       the world...and then...

       FAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the
       mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing
       sunglasses and a military haircut.

       The man seems to see Bond looking at him...

                           M
                 Bond, we'll meet you inside.

       Bond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back,
       the man is gone, like an APPARITION.

       Bond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise.

                                                            CUT TO:

       THE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY

       Bond stands on the hill, looking below.  He sees nothing but
       a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind.

       He hears a crunch of leaves...turns...

       HIS P.O.V.  A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill.
       Her china doll face is both fragile and proud.

                           WOMAN
                 Beautiful, isn't it?

                           BOND
                 Yes.

       She steps up to the ridge with him.  A breeze blows her hair.
       They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and
       strafe the valley.

                           WOMAN
                 Today, of all days, the sun decides to
                 shine.

                           BOND
                 Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the
                 Man Upstairs.

                           WOMAN
                 A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a
                 hostile takeover.

                           BOND
                 You knew him well?

       The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe.

                           WOMAN
                 He was my father.

                           BOND
                 I'm sorry.

                           WOMAN
                 He died before he could complete his
                 lifelong dream.
                     (beat)
                 I intend to finish it for him.

       A voice interrupts them, calling from the estate...

                           OLDER MAN
                 Elektra!

                           ELEKTRA
                 Excuse me.

       She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her
       delicate figure.  She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks
       back toward her father's grand house.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY

       M, Bond and Tanner in the rear of a limousine. The vehicle
       swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish
       Highlands.

                           M
                 Elektra?  Running King Industries?
                     (she broods)
                 I've known that girl all her life. I'm
                 not sure she knows what she's walking
                 into.

                           BOND
                 She's not a girl anymore.

       M looks at Bond. Eyes his sling.

                           M
                 I've scheduled a medical for you.

                           BOND
                 It's barely a scratch. The Dome broke my
                 fall.

                           M
                 Well, at least it turned out to have some
                 purpose.

       Bond gives her a look.

                           M
                 No-one goes into the field on this unless
                 they're 100%.  Dr. Greatrex is waiting.

       EXT. CASTLE THANE - HIGHLANDS - DAY

       The limousine swoops under the portcullis, into a courtyard.

       ADJUST ANGLE to reveal huge antennae and satellite dishes
       within.

       SUPER:  MI-6 REMOTE OPERATIONS CENTRE, SCOTLAND

       EXT. CORRIDOR - CASTLE THANE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond walks through the corridors.  Just before he enters the
       medical room, he removes his sling and casually drapes it on
       a suit of armor.

       INT. MEDICAL ROOM - CASTLE THANE - DAY

       Bond sits on the couch, shirt off, awaits the results of his
       medical.

       The very attractive DOCTOR GREATREX looks at her notes.

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 Dislocated collar bone.  If any more
                 tendons snap...
                     (looks up)
                 It won't just be two weeks out of action.

                           BOND
                 I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.

       She moves to him, touches the scarred and bruised bone.

                           BOND
                 It's just a scratch.

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 James.  It wouldn't really be...

       His hand comes up, rests on her waist.

                           BOND
                 Ethical?  Can't we just skirt the issue?

       And he pulls down the zip on her skirt.  Flicks the clasp and
       it drops to the floor.  She shakes her head -- as he starts
       undoing the buttons on her shirt.  She's very business-like,
       despite what's happening.

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 ...if you showed sufficient...willpower.
                 Promised to slow down.  Cut out running,
                 jumping...shooting.  All kinds of...

       And he pulls her toward him, they kiss.

                           BOND
                 Strenuous activity?

       Her shirt drops to the floor.  She pushes him back, lies on
       him.  Just wearing knickers now.  Between kisses:

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 Then maybe I'd be... open to that.

                           BOND
                     (smiles)
                 Perhaps after this ... test?

                           DOCTOR GREATREX
                 ...yes?...

                           BOND
                 I could come for a second opinion?

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- LATER

       A huge chandelier dominates the vast stone room. SEVERAL
       AGENTS listen to the debriefing.  ROBINSON and M watch TANNER
       explain things; he holds a FIFTY POUND NOTE and KING'S LAPEL
       PIN (now blackened, fused, melted to expose electronics
       beneath).

                           TANNER
                 ...The money was dipped in urea, dried,
                 and packed tight. In one note the metal
                 strip had been replaced with a
                 combustible magnesium circuit -- in
                 effect a tiny detonator. King always wore
                 a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called
                 'the Eye of the Glens'; but someone
                 switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro-
                 circuit emitting an electronic signature.

       ANGLE

       on BOND as he enters the room.  He hangs back in the shadows,
       watches Tanner mime the pin moving to the note:

                           TANNER
                 When he came within range of the money --
                 boom.  Ingenious.

       M steps forward.  Her fury controlled.

                           M
                 We've been pawns in someone's game. They
                 tricked us into bringing the money to
                 King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.

                           TANNER
                 And expensive.  Cost three million plus.

       Suddenly the chandelier darkens, the floor brightens into a
       VAST SCREEN, showing a satellite image of Central Asia and
       the Mediterranean.  M and Robinson walk onto the screen.

                           M
                 Cheap, if it achieves your aim of de-
                 stabilizing the Western World.

       She causes the desired stir.  Bond steps forward from the
       shadows to get a better view.  M sees the sling has gone.

                           M
                 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?

                           BOND
                 Caviar capital of the world. Matchless
                 beluga. Firm, yet subtle.
                     (M looks askance)
                 Largest landlocked body of water on
                 Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it.
                 Stalin beat him to it.

                           M
                 And now it's up for grabs, a goldrush.
                 Far more oil than anyone thought.

                           ROBINSON
                 Latest estimates, six trillion dollars.
                 It'll make the Gulf look like a puddle,
                 see us right through the new century.
                 The problem is getting the oil out of
                 there.

                           M
                 There are four pipelines in the works.
                 Three to the Black Sea, shipping out
                 through the Bosphorus. All vulnerable to
                 unstable governments or Russian blockade.

                           BOND
                 So Sir Robert's goes through Turkey,
                 direct to the Med...?

                           ROBINSON
                 A huge project. The most expensive of the
                 pipelines, but the one supported by every
                 Western leader. None of the American oil
                 companies were willing to take it on.
                 But King has connections to the region.
                 He married into the Vavra family, rich
                 local industrialists. He used those
                 connections to hold it all together.

                           BOND
                 Kill the man, kill the pipeline.

                           M
                 Not necessarily.  Not with Elektra taking
                 over.

       Tanner notices a RED LIGHT start pulsing.  He moves to M:

                           TANNER
                 Your call to the PM.

       M nods grimly.  As Robinson distributes sealed envelopes:

                           M
                 Our credibility has been hit hard.  We
                 have to hit back harder. Your
                 assignments.

       They open their envelopes, but Bond received nothing.

                           M
                     (to Bond)
                 I'm waiting for the report on your
                 medical.

       She leaves.  Bond is brooding.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. RESEARCH ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - NIGHT

       An ancient nook chock full of hi-tech equipment.  Bond
       concentrates on a screen displaying PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER
       AND TELEVISION CLIPS -- all to do with King's life and times.

       Bond touches the screen on a photo of...ELEKTRA.

       INT. SCREEN

       One story dominates -- the KIDNAPPING OF ELEKTRA KING. A
       Polaroid of Elektra savagely beaten, ear bandaged, holding a
       newspaper: beneath the photo is scrawled "$5,000,000."

                           NEWSCASTER
                 ...somehow managed to shoot two of her
                 captors and escape...

       POLICE VIDEO: Elektra interviewed; bruised, emotional.

                           VOICE
                 ... the leader, the one who escaped.  Can
                 you describe him?

                           ELEKTRA
                 He shouted.  He shouted all the time --

       Bond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears.

       His eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand:
       $5,000,000.  A thought forms.  He takes out his wallet,
       opening it and removing:

       THE RECEIPT FROM LACHAISE.

       E.C.U. The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303.03.

       Bond taps some keys. The words EXCHANGE RATE appear on the
       screen...pounds to dollars.

       He enters '3,030,303.03 POUNDS STERLING' and through
       multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes:

        '5,000,000 US DOLLARS.'  He stares at it.

                                                            CUT TO:

       Bond paces the flagstones, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING.

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - CONTINUOUS

       Bond opens the door on M who stands alone by the window,
       looking out at the long shadows on the moors.

                           BOND
                 Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra
                 King.

       She turns, her brow furrowing.

                           M
                 Who told you to look at Elektra's files?

                           BOND
                 I took the initiative.

                           M
                 You haven't been given an assignment in
                 this case.

                           BOND
                 I was the one who brought that money
                 in...

                           M
                 I'm well aware of your stake in this,
                 007.
                 If you have a point, get to it.

                           BOND
                 The amount of money that killed Robert
                 King is the same amount as the ransom
                 demand for Elektra.

       He hands her a slip of paper.

                           BOND
                 Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man
                 who killed her father.

       M looks at the paper, a long time.

                           M
                 It's a message.  He wants us to know he's
                 back.

                           BOND

       A HUGE, TRANSPARENT 3-D IMAGE OF RENARD'S SKULL floats in the

                 Sir Robert tried to deal with the
                 kidnapping with his own...resources, at
                 first. When Elektra's ear was delivered
                 to him in the post, he came to me.
                     (measured)
                 I advised against paying the ransom. I
                 knew it was Renard. I played it out as
                 long as possible to get a fix on him.

                 How many deaths is he responsible for?
                 How many innocent people? You may only
                 get one shot at a man like Renard. Same
                 circumstances, I'd do the same again.

       She turns to the hologram.

                 We sent 009 down to kill him.  Before he

                 That bullet is still there.

       Bond moves toward the ghostly Renard. We now see THE BULLET
       INSIDE HIS SKULL.

                           BOND
                 He survived?

                           M
                 The doctor who saved him couldn't get it
                 out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol
                 found the x-rays, there was mild
                 jubilation. Effectively, he's a dead man.

       She presses a button, the hologram turns...

                           M
                 The bullet is moving through the medulla
                 oblongata, killing off his sense of
                 touch. He feels no pain. He can push
                 himself harder, longer than any normal
                 man.

                           BOND
                 'That which does not kill me makes me
                 stronger.'

                           M
                 Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.

                           BOND
                 He's not through yet. Renard doesn't blow
                 up five million dollars unless he knows
                 there's more coming in. He's working for
                 someone. Someone who wants to stop the
                 pipeline.  And they hired the perfect
                 killer. One with a vendetta against
                 King...and you.

       MONEYPENNY ENTERS with a file, which she hands to M.

       M looks over the file: his medical report.

                           M
                 I see the good doctor gave you glowing
                 testimonials. 'Exceptional stamina'...

                           MONEYPENNY
                 He's always been good at oral exams.

       Moneypenny disappears out the door. M is all business.

                           M
                 Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider
                 who switched the pin. If your instincts
                 are right, Renard will be back. He hasn't
                 completed the job. The pipeline is still
                 going forward, and we have Elektra to
                 thank for that.

                           BOND
                 The worm on the hook again.

       They exchange a look. A look of recognition between two
       professionals, who know the terrible price of what they do.

       INT. Q'S LAB - NIGHT

       A Scot in a kilt plays the bagpipes -- badly.  He spins
       round, drops the pipe from his mouth, simultaneously fires
       bullets from one pipe and a jet of flame from another.  The
       target is a realistic dummy -- now a molten, bullet-ridden
       mess.

       We're in Q's laboratory.  He's walking Bond through.

                           BOND
                 Scottish heavy metal, Q?

                           Q
                 Oh pipe down, 007.
                     (irritated, hands over a WATCH)
                 Your 29th. Try not to lose this one. It
                 has dual lasers and a miniature grappling
                 hook with fifty feet of high-tensile
                 micro-filament, able to support 800
                 pounds.

       In the background, we see a man in a sleek black jacket. The
       man PULLS A STRING...the jacket becomes AN AIRBAG...it
       envelopes him, he gets impossibly tangled in it.

       Q ignores it, handing Bond a new pair of GLASSES.

                           Q
                 New refinement.  Sort of X-ray vision.
                 For checking concealed weapons.

                           BOND
                 And other uses, no doubt.

                           Q
                 Abuses in your case. You destroyed my
                 hydro-boat in less than seven minutes, as
                 no doubt will be the case with this...

       He presses a button and a section of ceiling lowers to reveal
       a BMW Z7.
       A MAN in a white coat is loading A MISSILE into one of the
       headlamps, then steps off the platform.  Q gestures to him.

                           Q
                 007, my Deputy Assistant.  I'm grooming
                 him to follow me.

                           BOND
                     (to Man)
                 That would make you..."R"?

                           R
                 Ahh, the rampant 007 wit.  I, of course,
                 am laughing inside.  But I dare say
                 you've met your match in this machine.
                     (touring the car)
                 The absolute latest in intercepts,
                 surveillance and countermeasures.
                 Titanium plating and armor, a multi-
                 tasking heads-up display. Completely
                 indestructible.  All in all, rather
                 stocked.

                           Q
                 'Fully loaded' I think is the term.

       "R" pats the fender, he's pretty damned fond of his machine.

                           R
                 Do take good care of her.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       A hot day. CAMERA soars over tall trees. We can just make out
       the sleek muscular car, beetle-black and far below, bouncing
       over rough terrain.  Bond "taking care" of his new BMW Z7.

       INT. BOND'S CAR - NR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       We join Bond at the wheel, driving hard, loving it, pushing
       up extreme inclines, smashing through overhanging limbs.

       EXT. PERIMETER FENCE, CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS
       MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Bond reaches a PERIMETER FENCE, manned by a GUARD.  The guard
       examines Bond's PASS and waves him through.

       EXT. AIRSTRIP AREA NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS
       MOUNTAINS - DAY (OLD SC. 69)

       As Bond drives on he passes an area where HELICOPTERS
       trailing GIANT SAWS are trimming back trees.  Felled trees
       are being dragged away, being replaced by huge metal sheets.
       An incredibly fast and well-oiled operation -- but why?

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Bond pulls up at the CONSTRUCTION SITE, teeming with ultra-
       modern robotic construction machines and vehicles.

       He gets out, and is immediately surrounded by men with guns.
       A man in a suit steps forward.  DAVIDOV is tall, blonde, with
       a dangerous charm Bond instantly recognizes as ex-KGB.

       He turns Bond around, hands on the car.  Pats him down.
       Pulls out an ID, checks it:

                           DAVIDOV
                     (excellent English)
                 Bond. A government man. I'm afraid since
                 you English got the boss killed we've
                 been a little...jumpy.

       Bond stares ahead, watches a PRIVATE JET swoops past...

       OMITTED

       EXT. AIRSTRIP AREA NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS
       MOUNTAINS - DAY

       The jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets Bond saw being
       laid as he passed...

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Davidov pulls out Bond's gun.

                           BOND
                     (re:  gun)
                 I'd rather you didn't play with that.

       Davidov ignores him, looking the gun over.

                           DAVIDOV
                 Nice.

                           BOND
                 Quite stunning.

       Bond turns to watch a LIFTING HELICOPTER swoop in and drop
       down an air-conditioned office.  Military precision.

       Davidov's radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun
       back to Bond.  They start walking:

                           DAVIDOV
                     (pleasant)
                 Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits
                 die hard. I am Head of Security.
                 Davidov.

       Bond eyes him, but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt
       ahead of them.

       Stairs swing down and out steps ELEKTRA KING.  Beautiful,
       elegant.  So out of place in this world of men.  She surveys
       the worksite.

       Impressed, Bond takes his ID back from Davidov.

       INT. OFFICE, CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond and Davidov step into a fully functioning office.
       Everything Elektra requires is here. Computer, phones, drinks
       cabinet. She is in the middle of a group of workmen and
       secretaries, looking at plans, talking, pouring herself a cup
       of coffee.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to Foreman)
                 ...they should have been in place two
                 days ago. That is the target my father
                 set.

                           FOREMAN
                 We've had some trouble with the villagers
                 at Ruan. Some sacred burial plot...

                           DAVIDOV
                 Miss King...James Bond here to see you.

       She looks up...a brief moment of RECOGNITION...then back to
       business.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Find me the research on the limestone
                 deposits, go ahead and place these
                 orders, and get the jeep ready. I will go
                 to Ruan myself...

                           DAVIDOV
                 Miss King, I wouldn't recommend...

                           ELEKTRA
                 I said, I will go.

       She signs some documents and the men file out. She gets up,
       turning her back to Bond, hands on her hips.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Would you excuse us, Davidov?

       Davidov nods and leaves. Elektra still keeps her back turned,
       but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her
       arms cross in front of her. When she finds her voice, it has
       a gravelly sound of emotion.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I met you at my father's funeral.

                           BOND
                 Yes.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I haven't been able to recall a single
                 moment of that day...until now.

                           BOND
                 Funerals aren't exactly memorable.

                           ELEKTRA
                 God no. All those horrible loved ones and
                 relatives. I don't want to talk to those
                 people. I just want to...talk to my
                 father.
                     (beat)
                 I loved him.  I'm not sure he knew that.

                           BOND
                 Is that why you want to finish the
                 pipeline?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Partially, yes.

       Her muscleman BODY GUARD appears, says briefly:

                           GABOR
                 The jeep is ready, Ma'am.  Will I be
                 driving with you?

                           ELEKTRA
                 No, Gabor. We have a guest.

       Gabor glares at Bond before he leaves.

                           BOND
                 Who is he?

                           ELEKTRA
                 My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere.
                 He's decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an
                 excellent omelette.

                           BOND
                 How long has he been with you?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?

       Bond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm,
       shows it to her.

                           BOND
                 Does this look familiar to you?

                           ELEKTRA
                 It's my father's pin. He wore it everyday
                 of his life.

       She swallows back emotion. Looks in his eyes, with a sad half-
       smile that unsettles him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are you trying to break my heart? Or is
                 it just your way with women?

                           BOND
                 It's not the pin your father wore. It's
                 an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny
                 electrical detonator. We have reason to
                 believe the assassin had an inside
                 accomplice, someone who worked at this
                 company.

                           ELEKTRA
                 If you've come here to look after me, Mr.
                 Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I
                 have two bodyguards, I don't need a
                 third...

       She starts to walk out.  He follows her...

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

                           BOND
                 The killer doesn't want to see this
                 pipeline continue, doesn't want to see
                 you take over...

                           ELEKTRA
                 That's every man within a five mile
                 radius.  Including you.
                     (off his look)
                 That's why you're here, isn't it? You
                 think I can't do it. You think I'm going
                 to screw up. Or get myself killed.

                           BOND
                 I think running this pipeline would be a
                 difficult job for anyone. Especially
                 King's daughter.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am
                 the only person who can do it.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. JEEP, TRAVELING - OILFIELDS - DAY

       Elektra drives the all-terrain jeep with casual assurance.
       Bond is beside her, cold-weather gear in the back.  They're
       following a huge pipeline, passing a blighted petrified
       forest of twisted iron:  derelict oil derricks.

       Elektra gestures at the oil fields they're now leaving
       behind.  Receding into the distance, a DELTA OF ROADWAYS
       perched on rusting stilts juts out into the sea.

                           ELEKTRA
                 My mother's people discovered oil here
                 ninety years ago.  The Bolsheviks
                 slaughtered them for it.
                     (beat)
                 Some say oil is in my family's blood.  I
                 say our blood is in the oil. This is the
                 very heart of the planet.  Up here in the
                 hills was Eden, literally.  Look what the
                 Russians did to it.  Now we have a second
                 chance and this time we'll do it right.
                 When the other wells have all dried up,
                 she'll still be pumping her lifeblood to
                 the world.  And this
                     (proudly, of pipeline)
                 Will be one of the main arteries...

       EXT. POV FROM HELICOPTER - DAY

       Bond and Elektra travel beside the vast pipe through
       dramatic, beautiful, scenery...

       INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

       Davidov and Gabor, in the helicopter, watch the jeep below.

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS
       (CAPPADOCIA, THE VILLAGE OF ZELVE) - DAY

       The jeep reaches a break in the pipe: a SURVEY CAMP, flags,
       strings.  The SURVEY CREW cower behind a 4WD, local tribesman
       are stoning them from a village carved into the rock.  A lot
       of SHOUTING.

       Before Bond can stop her, Elektra gets out, moves toward the
       tribesmen.  The stoning ceases. They know who she is.  She
       begins to speak quietly -- in their own tongue.

       INT. CHAPEL, ZELVE - DAY

       A stunning pre-Byzantine chapel hewn from the rock.  Flames
       illuminate beautiful mosaics and paintings on the cavern
       wall.  A COPTIC PRIEST proudly shows Elektra about, jabbering
       in his mother tongue.  She answers in his language.

       Bond watches her, impressed.

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP - DISTORTED ELECTRONIC POV, FROM
       ABOVE:

       We hear the click of high-powered electronic binoculars,
       zeroing in on Bond and Elektra as they return to the survey
       team.  This can't be Davidov's view, as the helicopter has
       settled down below.

       EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Bond is edgy.  Someone is out there.  He's sure of it.  He
       sees Davidov and Gabor scanning the area as well.  Elektra
       speaks to the foreman.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Send the pipe around.

                           FOREMAN
                 It will take weeks, cost millions.
                 Your father approved this route.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Then my father was wrong.

       The first time Elektra has asserted her own authority. The
       foreman is surprised, angry. But he doesn't question her.

       She moves toward the helicopter, says to Bond:

                           ELEKTRA
                 I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor
                 will drive you back.

                           BOND
                 Always wanted to see the upper lines.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You don't take no for an answer, do you?

                           BOND
                 No.

       She shrugs, mischief in her eyes.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Alright then. Do you ski?

       Bond just smiles.

                           BOND
                 I've been known to.

       INT/EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

       The chopper swoops over SNOWY WASTES.  It reaches a mountain
       peak, hovers.  The wind is strong, buffeting.

       Elektra and Bond are both now in ski suits, Bond wearing a
       sleek black jacket.

                           PILOT
                 Can't land.  Wind's too strong!

                           ELEKTRA
                 Just hold her steady.
                     (to Bond)
                 You wanted to see it.

       She steps into her skis, opens the door.  Wind rushes in.

       EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

       Without a moment's hesitation, Elektra leaps out of the
       chopper and falls fifteen feet, landing on the move.

       INT/EXT.  HELICOPTER - DAY

       Unbelieving, Bond quickly dons skis and leaps after her.

       EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

       Below him on the mountain, she is already a way ahead.  Her
       skiing is fearless.  Bond likes a challenge...

       They wind down the slope, competitive, testing one another,
       enjoying it.

       EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

       After an exhilarating run, she stops on the edge of a huge
       drop.  Bond joins her.  They look down at the snowy valley
       below.  A line of survey FLAGS visible through the middle.

                           ELEKTRA
                 We're building from both ends.  This is
                 where they'll meet.  Fifteen hundred
                 miles from the Caspian to the
                 Mediterranean.

       Bond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the
       only two people in the world, when they hear: THE DISTANT HUM
       OF A PLANE.

       EXT. SKY - DAY

       They see FOUR OBJECTS falling out the back of the aircraft.
       As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they POP
       PARACHUTES, their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra
       watch in disbelief...

       GUNFIRE echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as
       PARASKIS, low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles.

       EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

       Bond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the
       approaching machines.

                           BOND
                 Head for that gully, I'll lure them into
                 the trees!

       He points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers
       cover...she skis off to shelter and he skis OUT...INTO THE
       OPEN...where the paraskis trail after him...

       He streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him,
       firing...

       EXT. FOREST

       He makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees,
       whipping in and out of sight as PARASKI #1 tries to follow,
       sinking lower and lower until...

       HIS SKIDS catch on some over hanging branches...the Paraski
       is CATAPULTED into a tree and EXPLODES...

       EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

       Coming in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2,
       firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind
       him in the snow.  The other two paraskis LAND and eject their
       chutes, now RACING THROUGH THE WOODS on the ground.

       Bond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through
       the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit
       another and wipe out behind.

       But the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is
       gaining on him...Bond bursts out of the trees and finds
       himself heading toward...

       THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE...

       He cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the
       edge.  Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and SAILS OFF THE CLIFF to a
       hundred and fifty foot drop.

                           BOND
                     (smiling)
                 Should have stuck to snowboarding.

       But the smile is wiped off his face as...AN EMERGENCY
       PARACHUTE deploys from the back...

       The Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for
       him...

       Bond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when PARASKI #2
         appears in front of him...guns blazing...

       One ahead and one behind, Bond turns back...he has nowhere to
       go but...

       OVER THE EDGE

       He sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4,
       slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off
       and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow,
       where he lands on his skis... Paraski four, the chute
       tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to
       maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward
       PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond,
       they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER...

       IN THE GULLY BELOW

       Bond meets up with Elektra as above them...

       The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above
       and tumbling down, end over end.

       Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain
       down on them.

       Then...silence.  An eerie silence.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are they gone? All of them?

       Bond nods, ripping from his pole a PIECE OF THE PARACHUTE he
       slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece
       of fabric in his hand.  He sees:

       CYRILLIC LETTERS...undecipherable to us...but there is a look
       on his face, a look of recognition as...

       AN EARTH RATTLING RUMBLE grows above them.

       Bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he
       turns...

       The exploding Paraskis have triggered AN AVALANCHE on the
       slope above.

       EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY

       They try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they
       haven't a hope... the rest of the snow is catching them,
       they're going to get swallowed.

       EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY

       The ground shudders, the THUNDER CLOSING...  Their ankles are
       soon covered, Elektra falls.  Bond stops, pulls her up.
       They're about to die.  He pulls her to him.

                           BOND
                 Hold on to me.

       She's confused and frightened but does as she's told.

       They hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white
       fury hurtles over them, burying them...  At the last moment,
       just as their heads vanish from view...

       CLOSE ON BOND PULLING THE Q GADGET ON THE JACKET.

       The AIRBAG slams open.  The snow covers it and them.  More
       and more snow slides over...

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. SNOW HOLE - MOMENTS LATER

       Darkness.  The RUMBLING CEASES...

       Light emanates from Bond's watch.  In the shadows he pulls a
       knife, punctures the air bag. It deflates, leaving them
       cocooned in an icy tomb.  Elektra looks around, staring,
       unbelieving.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Oh my God...we're buried alive...

                           BOND
                 We're alright.

       But her breath is coming in short, irregular bursts.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I can't stay here.

                           BOND
                 You're not going to.

       Bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle.  Flicks
       open the small blade.  He starts to cut a hole in the snow
       above their heads. She stops him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 No!  It will cave in!

                           BOND
                 It's the only way out...

       The snow CREAKS eerily, she gasps, terror mounting.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I can't breathe, I can't breathe...

       Bond grabs her, holds her tight.  She resists, bucks.

                           BOND
                 Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!

                     (she does)
                 You're alright. Everything will be
                 alright.  Trust me.

       Finally, arrested by the strength in his eyes, she calms...

       EXT. MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER

       A beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow.  All is quiet.
       CLOSER

       Bond's fist PUNCHES through the white.  He pulls the snow
       away, climbs out.  Leans in, lifts Elektra out.

       Bond and Elektra stand, lone figures in the perfect white.
       They hear a sound...HELICOPTER ROTORS.  Rescue on its way.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY

       An establishing shot of Bond's BMW parked outside the ornate
       villa on the shore of the golden Caspian.

       INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY

       Palatial.  Hallway dominated by a LARGE PAINTING of a bearded
       man in traditional Turkish garb, sitting proudly on a horse.

       Davidov, Gabor, waiting, pacing.

       Bond is sits in a chair, ON EDGE, writing something over and
       over on a small pad of paper...THE CYRILLIC LETTERS on the
       parachute fragment.

       A DOCTOR comes down the grand staircase. The men stand.

                           DOCTOR
                 She's fine. Contusions. A slight strain
                 to her ankle, but otherwise, fine.
                     (to Bond)
                 She wants to see you.

       INT. ELEKTRA'S BEDROOM - SUNSET

       Bond enters. Elektra is standing by the window watching the
       golden ball of the sun sink into the sea. She wears nothing
       but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it,
       outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are you alright?

       He nods.  He is wound tight, she senses it.

                           BOND
                 I can't stay.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I know.

       A moment.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I need to ask you something.  And I need
                 you to tell me the truth.

       He waits.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Who is it? Who is trying to kill me?

       Bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong.
       He cannot tell her the truth.

                           BOND
                 I don't know. But I will find him.

       She stares at him, sensing he is withholding something. She
       turns back to the window.

       He approaches behind her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 After the kidnapping...I was afraid to go
                 outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd,
                 to do anything at all, until I
                 realized...
                     (pause)
                 There's no point in living if you
                 can't...feel alive.

       She looks out at the fading sun.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I can't huddle in the shadows. I can't
                 let fear run my life.  I won't.

       She turns to him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 The way I acted, in the snow...you must
                 think I'm a coward.

                           BOND
                 I think you're one of the bravest people
                 I've ever met.

       She looks up at him, into his eyes; they are so close. All
       she has to do is tilt her mouth upward...she kisses him.  His
       hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her
       body melting into his, and then...

       He pulls back. Has to physically step away from her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 What is it?

                           BOND
                 ...you should rest.

       That was exactly the wrong thing to say. He sees the
       rebellion flair in her eyes.

                           ELEKTRA
                 James...

                           BOND
                 I have to go.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Then take me with you.

                           BOND
                 No. You'll be safe here.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I don't want to be safe!

                           BOND
                 I have to go to work.

       He starts toward the door.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Now who's the coward?

       He stops, his back up...then heads out the door.

       IN THE HALLWAY

       He passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EST. SHOT - EXT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

       Elegant, mysterious.  A modern day Casablanca.

       INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

       Bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino. He takes out
       the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room --

       HIS X-RAY POV

       He can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players.  All sizes
       of pistol, even the odd grenade.  The obvious side-effect of
       this view -- he can see through clothes.

       His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him.  One of
       them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display.  She
       returns Bond's smile.  Her friend turns to look.  Bond's
       smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one
       breast.

       INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

       He looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes.
       His old adversary, ex-KGB, VALENTIN ZUKOVSKY, talking to some
       suspicious types. Zukovsky looks across. Bond walks toward
       him.

                           BOND
                 Valentin Zukovsky.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 BondJamesBond. What brings you here?

                           BOND
                 You, of course. I need some information.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place.
                 Used to be the royal family's, now it's
                 mine. I run my little business, I stay
                 out of trouble...

                           BOND
                     (looking about)
                 Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies,
                 consortiums from every country in the
                 world.  A nice little rat's nest.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                     (offering hors d'ouevres)
                 Have some of the rat's nest caviar.  From
                 my own fishery.  They buy my caviar,
                 drink my champagne, lose to my House.

       He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Let me introduce you to a former
                 colleague of mine at the KGB. Dmitri
                 Palov, you may know him as...the Boa.

       The Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands.

                           BOA
                 The great 007. For years I have dreamed
                 of closing my hands around your neck.

                           BOND
                 Boa. Have you had any therapy since
                 Perestroika?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Why am I suddenly worried I'm not
                 carrying enough insurance?

       The Boa leaves, glaring all the while.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 See?  You're upsetting my customers.
                 What do you want?

                           BOND
                 How does a terrorist like Renard supply
                 his men with state-of-the-art Russian
                 Army weapons?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 What?  This is not possible.

       Bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the PARACHUTE.
       Zukovsky examines the letters.

                           BOND
                 If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st
                 airborne division.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Where did you get this?

                           BOND
                 Off a high-powered Paraski that was
                 trying to kill me.

       Zukovsky shakes his head. Sighs.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 The Russian Army, they spend millions on
                 flying skis, but they cannot afford to
                 pay the soldiers. The men, they do what
                 they have to do to feed their families.
                 In this country, for the right price and
                 a pack of cigarettes, you can get
                 anything you want.

       He notices Bond watching THE HOSTESS BAR...a dark alcove of
       the casino, where slinky HOOKERS flatter the guests.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 That too. Everyone does what they can to
                 survive.

                           BOND
                 How high up does this...arms dealing go?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is
                 Renard. Our government has nothing to
                 gain by killing you.

                           BOND
                 But you would have something to gain by
                 killing Robert King. And stopping his
                 pipeline.

       This hits Zukovsky. He closes down. A chill between them.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Poor Bond. The cold war is over.  What
                 have you got left? Economic espionage.
                 Murder in the boardroom.  So dull.

       Bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino.

       HIS POV:  ELEKTRA...more vibrant than we have ever seen her,
       living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a
       sparkling dress that fits like second skin.  Her hair is full
       and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild.

                           BOND
                 Oh, you'd be surprised.

       Bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and
       turns away, making her way to the Roulette tables.

       Bond follows her across the casino. They are like two cats,
       moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and
       sexy, all eyes on them. He takes note as she passes...MINIMUM
       $100, then $500, $1000...

       She finally stops at the 'No limit' table.  Crowded with the
       nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks,
       South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian
       industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink.

       ZUKOVSKY is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the
       center.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 We've kept your father's chair free.

                           ELEKTRA
                 And his account?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 You have a credit line of a million and a
                 half.

       He gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of
       CHIPS toward her. A WAITRESS is right there to take her
       order.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Vodka martini.

                           BOND
                 Two. Shaken not stirred.

       He leans in, smiling his charming smile as he says:

                           BOND
                 What the hell are you doing here?

                           ELEKTRA
                     (smiling right back)
                 Someone wants to kill me, I'd rather die
                 looking him straight in the eye.
                     (lightly)
                 What are you doing here?  Looking for a
                 woman a little more your type? How about
                 that one?

       She points to a SHOW GIRL in a feather headdress and pasties.

                           BOND
                 If this little show is for my benefit,
                 I'll take you home right now.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You had your chance, James. Now I'm
                 looking for a bigger thrill.

       She pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them
       stand on her bet.  The whole table exhales. Then, it starts:
       bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival.

       Bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous...

       HIS P.O.V.  He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from
       the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this
       way and that...he looks suspicious as hell.

       Bond watches, his blood running, and then...

       Davidov slips into the HOSTESS BAR.  A HOOKER is soon
       wrapping herself around him. After a few words, she leads him
       off toward the back.

       Bond returns to the game, shaking his head.  He watches as
       THE DEALER DEALS FROM THE SHOE.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. SALON PRIV - NIGHT

       A small room.  Lit by sconces that sport LIVE FLAMES.  Tacky-
       luxurious, a refracted Eastern reflection on an old west
       whore house.

       Davidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove.  He faces a
       small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see THE
       HOOKER behind him, on the bed.

                           HOOKER
                 You want to be...on top, or not on top?

                           DAVIDOV
                 On top.

       She slowly pulls a pair of SILK ROPES out from her bra and
       DANGLES THEM.

                           HOOKER
                 Tied up, or not tied up?

       Davidov smiles, struggling with his belt.  He looks down,
       gets it, looks up...his heart stops...it is not the hooker in
       the mirror but...

       RENARD'S FRIGHTENING FACE.

       Davidov spins.

       HIS P.O.V.  Renard's henchman stands by the door, an
       automatic rifle cocked at Davidov.

                           RENARD
                 Dead, or not dead?

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE

       Elektra with black king showing. A seven beneath.

                           BOND
                 I understand it's normally good practice
                 to get the feel of the cards before going
                 off the deep end.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Really?

       And with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a
       hit.  The Dealer gives her an eight.  She reveals her cards.

                           DEALER
                 Bust.

       He rakes in her chips. But Elektra is undeterred.  She pushes
       another pile forward as the next deal commences.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I like the deep end, James.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. SALON PRIVE

       The HENCHMAN holds Davidov against the wall with his huge
       fist around his neck.  Near his head, the live flame of a
       SCONCE hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel
       from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it.

       The HOOKER, obviously one of Renard's gang, has finished
       donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun
       onto her shoulder.

       Renard looks distastefully at the room.

                           RENARD
                 Is this how you spend the money I pay
                 you? And with the rest you hire fools who
                 shoot like blind men?

                           DAVIDOV
                     (croaks out)
                 Bond...

                           RENARD
                 Should be dead as well. Your failure
                 today is astonishing.  It is a disgrace.

       He approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming SCONCE
       near his head.

                           RENARD
                 Do you know why the color is blue at the
                 wick?

       Davidov starts to sweat.

                           RENARD
                 Because that is where the flame is the
                 hottest.

       Renard touches the glass well of oil.

                           RENARD
                 The temperature is close to five hundred
                 degrees.

       Renard uses his knife and POPS the seal from the lamp,
       removing the well of oil...a DROP of the hot oil FALLS ON HIS
       HAND and SINGES IT BLACK in an instant...

       Renard does not even flinch.  Davidov starts talking, trying
       to placate...

                           DAVIDOV
                 The plane...it's all been arranged...

                           RENARD
                 Then you are completely unnecessary...

       Renard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head:

                           DAVIDOV
                 I have the documents, the landing
                 authorizations, the security passes...

       Renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour...

       His dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw
       him?...seems to glitter in the light...

                           RENARD
                 Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner,
                 tonight.  We understand each other?

                           DAVIDOV
                 Yes...yes...

       Renard lets a TRICKLE OF OIL drop onto Davidov's head...

       HE SCREAMS as his hair smokes and singes...

       Renard makes a motion, the THUG releases Davidov, who falls
       to the floor, clutching his head.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE

       Another deal. ZUKOVSKY and others watch, as Elektra stakes
       even more.  People move closer for a view.  The Dealer shows
       a five. Elektra shows Bond her cards.

       Elektra is holding two eights. Dealer's up-card is a six.

                           BOND
                 Stand or split them.

       She smiles. He holds her gaze.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Surely you believe in living dangerously.

                           BOND
                 Not at that price. Time to surrender.

       They eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air.
       She smiles.  She moves ALL HER CHIPS forward.

       Bond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky:

                           DEALER
                 The House has no limit.

       General kerfuffle.  Bond looks back toward THE HOSTESS
       BAR...no sign of Davidov's return...

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to Dealer)
                 Hit me.

       The Dealer scoops a card from the shoe.  Tension.  Everyone
       holds their breath...as he turns over...  -- a six.  Bust.
       The audience inhale as one AS THE DEALER TAKES ALL HER CHIPS
       AWAY.

       Elektra stands.  She has dignity in defeat. She turns to
       Bond, holding out a hand.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Time to surrender.

       EXT. CASINO - NIGHT

       Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them,
       trying to look like he hasn't been through hell.  Bond
       notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self-
       consciously.

                           DAVIDOV
                 A little accident.

                           BOND
                 A night of burning passion?

       Davidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away...

                                                            CUT TO:

       A DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE.

       Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW.

                           HENCHMAN (V.O.)
                 What about Bond?

       EXT. CASINO ROOF

       RENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by
       the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back,
       their easy sensuality as they both get into the car.

                           HENCHMAN
                 Sir?  Sir?

                           RENARD
                     (seething)
                 I will take care of Mister Bond.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

       Bond and Elektra emerge from the BMW.  Behind them, Gabor and
       Davidov get out of her car. Bond watches as Davidov slams his
       door and marches off, angry, toward the SECURITY QUARTERS at
       the side of the house.

       Bond and Elektra walk to the front door, anticipation thick
       in the air.  Gabor opens the door. Elektra sweeps through...

       INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

       Bond pauses just inside the open doorway.

       HIS P.O.V.  Two figures in the cavernous entrance hall,
       Elektra having a brief word with Gabor, before he turns and
       exits, leaving only...

       ELEKTRA AND BOND.

       She starts upstairs, Bond's eyes locked on her body, and
       then:

       SHE LOOKS BACK...just once.  But it says everything. She
       continues upward.

       Bond taps the front door closed with his foot.

       INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

       Half-light.  They're entwined between the sheets.  This is
       something slow, languorous, not to be rushed.  We can't make
       out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat.

       Her fingers trace the contours of his torso.  Linger on his
       bruised collar-bone.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You knew when you first saw me.  You knew
                 it would be like this.

                           BOND
                 Shush.

       Her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed.  She rubs a
       slither of ice down her chest, shudders with pleasure.  It's
       a move Bond hasn't seen before.

       Now she brings the ice to his shoulder.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Poor shoulder. Looks painful...

       She kisses his purple flesh.  Licks.

                           BOND
                 ...needs constant attention...

       She slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above
       the tendon.  And he pulls the ice from her hand:

                           BOND
                 Enough ice for one day.

       Tosses it across the room as passion takes over...

       INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - LATER

       A puddle of water where the ice fell.

       Post-sex on the bed. He traces a hand down her naked back.
       The sweat glistens off the curve of her spine.  She turns.
       The light glints off her jewelled earlobe...he touches it.

                           BOND
                 You never take this off?

       Elektra looks at him.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Why do men always want to undress the one
                 part of a woman's body she doesn't want
                 to reveal?

       She reaches to the large, diamond-encrusted earring and
       gently plucks it away. Pulls her lush hair back...

       The lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen
       clump of scar tissue. It is the only mark on her perfect
       body. A physical reminder of her ordeal. It breaks his heart.

                           BOND
                 How did you survive?

                           ELEKTRA
                 I used my body on the guards.  It gave me
                 control. I got to a gun and I took my
                 chance.
                     (beat)
                 I've never told anyone that.

       They are looking at each other, both suddenly feeling
       something dangerously close to real connection.  It is not
       what Bond expected.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Do you ever stop, James?  Do you ever
                 think about...another kind of life?

       He holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away.

                           BOND
                 I can't afford to.

       She frowns, slightly.  Settles into his chest.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Don't worry. I know who you are.

       He holds her, eyes full of conflict, staring into the dark.

       EXT. VILLA - NIGHT - LATER

       The lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the
       perimeter wall of the property.

       EXT. SECURITY QUARTERS - SAME

       Bond's car, several of Elektra's vehicles, all parked around
       the security office.  They have been joined by:

       A WHITE ECONOMY CAR, a Russian make, with a familiar SEAL
       painted on the door...we've seen it before, the seal on top
       of the stolen report at the beginning...Miratom.

       Out of the driver's seat steps...DAVIDOV.  He carries a
       briefcase from the car to the front door of the security
       office. He looks around furtively before he disappears
       inside.

       The parking area is dark and silent and then:

       JAMES BOND sits up in the driver's seat of his BMW.

       INT. BMW - SAME

       Bond sticks his key in the ignition and activates the car's
       various systems.

       HIS P.O.V.  Davidov is a shadow in the office window.

       Bond flicks a switch.  A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from
       the BMW to the window of the office.  He can HEAR a synthesis
       of Davidov's voice...

                           DAVIDOV (V.O.)
                 I'm running late...no, no, I'll make
                 it...how will they know I'm your
                 man?...romashka...romashka...alright.

       Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up.  He flicks
       another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system
       activates in his WINDSCREEN...

       He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the
       security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE
       BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK.

       He goes back inside.

       BOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian
       vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the
       lock on the trunk.  It pops open.

       Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING
       ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside:

       A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped
       forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet
       ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD
       EYES.

       Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket.

       It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and
       Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of
       the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the
       report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it.

       AT THE OFFICE

       Davidov is coming out...

       Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car.

       AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE

       Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian
       car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then...

       HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks
       AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear...

       THE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever
       was.

       Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT

       The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted
       AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared
       airstrip.

       INT. CAR

       Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded
       area.

       EXT. CAR

       Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and
       opens the trunk.

       He removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks
       down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but
       something is different, the clothes not quite right and then:

       THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps...

       It IS JAMES BOND.

                           BOND
                 Problem, comrade?

       Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is
       quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the
       head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes
       go wide and he crumbles, dead.

       Bond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov.

                           BOND
                 Old habits die hard.

       He straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He
       searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He
       opens the lock.

       INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents
       headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security
       tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's
       name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags --
       and a polaroid-type camera.

       He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the
       camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in
       'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass.

       Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but...

       A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP.

       HIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees,
       flying low, its red landing lights blinking.

       EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

       A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step
       unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits
       in the doorway.

       BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge
       and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking
       into.

                           BOND
                 Here goes nothing.

       He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to
       the plane.  He starts up the steps:

       THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him
       IN RUSSIAN.

       Bond pauses.  And then, thinking, says:

                           BOND
                 Romashka.

       The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon.

       INT. PLANE

       Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two
       young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a
       big, thick-necked tough.

       They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or
       do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the
       briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY.

       The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still
       stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that
       sounds like..."where's the rest?"

       Bond swallows.  Thinks, without showing it.  He decides to
       OPEN THE DUFFLE BAG.  He looks inside. Pauses, then reaches
       in and takes out...A BOX OF NIKE SHOES.

       The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out
       shoes to the rest of the guys.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN

       A red dawn.  Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly-
       shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip.  The plane
       approaching.

       INT. PLANE - LANDING

       The three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat
       amongst themselves.

       Bond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by
       heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly
       cargo. There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he
       clearly recognizes:  DANGER - RADIOACTIVE.

       Bond looks out of the window.  Beneath a huge MESA, a huddle
       of low buildings.

       They come to a stop near the end of the runway.  A SMALL JEEP
       is driving out to them.

       One of the soldiers throws something to Bond. An ORANGE
       JUMPSUIT that says Miratom on the breast.  He catches it.

                           PILOT
                     (subtitles)
                 You have fifteen minutes.

       EXT. AIRSTRIP/VALLEY/TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN

       Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is
       driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley -
       -

       KABOOM!

       A cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side
       of the hill.

       EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY

       They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several
       Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around,
       IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and
       personnel quietly going about their business.  A vast
       protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building.

       INT. 'BUBBLE' - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY
       (CHRISTMAS JONES') POV:

       The sound of breathing LOUD, we're looking from inside the
       visor of a protective suit.  It's hard to tell what's going
       on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue
       plutonium from inside a corroding WARHEAD...

       EXT. FACILITY - SAME

       An officer eyes Bond's pass.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (subtitles)
                 You are late. The transport documents?

       Bond shows him the case.  Akakievich examines the documents.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (subtitles)
                 They are waiting for you below.  It
                 should be ready. Check with the IDA
                 physicist.

       He points toward the "bubble."

       Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE
       finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box.

       As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE
       steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit.

       Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL
       AMERICAN GIRL.  CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish
       hair, hot right now.  In one movement she unzips and steps
       out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off
       shorts, heavy duty boots.  A nasty-looking hunting knife
       strapped around her hips.  She has a deep tan and an
       incredible figure.

       She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles.

       Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly,
       also unable to take his eyes off her.  He spits on the floor
       and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                 Not interested in men. Take my word for
                 it.

       Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker.  Bond
       offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away.

       Christmas approaches.  He notices her IDA tag -- and an
       incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking
       him out as well.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 You new?

                           BOND
                     (Russian accent)
                 Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones.
                 No jokes, I've heard them all.

                           BOND
                 Don't know any doctor jokes.

       She is wary.  It's been a long time since a man this
       attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the
       building.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What happened to Len Tashka?

                           BOND
                 Couldn't make it. Splitting headache.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The soldiers may give you a hard time.
                 Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd
                 have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by
                 the roadsides, rotting in the sun.

       Bond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS.

                           BOND
                 Will I need protection?

       She squints at him, taken aback.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 There's no radiation danger down there.

       Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped.  Christmas then
       speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (subtitles)
                 Where is this stockpile going?

       Bond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN.

                           BOND
                     (subtitles)
                 To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.

       She nods. Watches him disappear into the building.

       INT. TEST CHAMBER MAIN ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

       Bond descends, going down deep.

       INT. TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER

       The elevator creaks to a halt.  He slides the elevator doors
       OPEN revealing...

       TWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator. Bond shows them his
       ID.

                           SOLDIER
                     (subtitles)
                 See the corporal, at the end of the
                 chamber.

       The soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving
       Bond completely ALONE.

       Dead silence in the shadows.  Bond's in his element, that
       alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings.

       HIS P.O.V.  A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more
       open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming
       there.

       Bond starts down the passageway.

       INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a
       NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit.

       Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring
       equipment.

       Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes
       to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the
       opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in
       Russian Army fatigues.

                           BOND
                 Corporal?

       The man turns...

       IT IS RENARD.

       He smiles.

                           RENARD
                 I see my friend Davidov ran into some
                 difficulty.

                           BOND
                 Indeed.

       Renard starts toward him.  Bond draws his gun.

                           BOND
                 Don't come any closer.

                           MAN
                 You can't kill me. I'm already dead.

       He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a
       ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit.

                           RENARD
                 Go ahead.  Shoot.  My men will still
                 steal the bomb, and the shot will bring
                 them directly to you.

       Renard gestures into the pit.

       BOND'S P.O.V.  TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of
       what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One
       of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN
       REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner.

       Bond aims his gun at Renard's head.

                           BOND
                 Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?

       Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the
       pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless.

                           RENARD
                 To die by a man who can't even grasp what
                 he's caught up in...

       Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove
       a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb.  It is the size and
       shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on
       it...the man slips it into his pocket.

                           BOND
                 Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's
                 clever is getting someone else to pay for
                 it.

                           RENARD
                 Not many people in this world have that
                 kind of fortune.

       Bond cocks the pistol.

                           BOND
                 Who is it?

                           RENARD
                 You think I fear death? I welcome it. I
                 get on my knees and pray for it. You, on
                 the other hand, you have something to
                 live for, no?
                     (closer now)
                 She's beautiful isn't she? You should
                 have seen her before. Flawless, and still
                 so innocent, not such a whore in bed...

       Bond's eyes flare in fury.  He shoves Renard into the wall
       and presses the gun to his temple.

                           BOND
                 You will never touch her. You will never
                 get near her.

                           RENARD
                 Have you forgotten who saved your life in
                 Geneva?

                           BOND
                 Consider me ungrateful.

                           RENARD
                 It's I who should thank you -- for taking
                 that money back to MI-6.  So distressing
                 for M.  An explosion inside her lair.

                           BOND
                 She'll get over it.

                           RENARD
                 You even brought the plane for us.  We
                 really couldn't have done it without you.

       Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol.  Renard
       drops to his knees.  He touches his temple, looks at the
       blood curiously, feeling no pain.

                           RENARD
                 A man tires of being executed.

       As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun:

                           RENARD
                 But then again...There is no point in
                 living if you can't...feel alive.

       Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES
       HIM, just a beat, but it is enough...

       SUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with
       COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers.

       We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and
       see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard --
       classic execution stance:

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (to Bond)
                 Drop your gun.

                           BOND
                 Keep away, Colonel.

       The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 He is an impostor.
                     (clutching a printout)
                 There's no Davidov at Miratom.

                           BOND
                 Here's your imposter. He's paid off the
                 men on the plane outside.  They're not
                 taking the bomb to any Russian facility,
                 they're flying it wherever he tells them.

       Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle.

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                     (to Bond)
                 I said drop it.

       And he means business.  Bond delays ... but has no choice.
       He pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down.

                           RENARD
                     (to Christmas)
                 Well done -- he would have killed us all.
                 I suppose you
                     (to Akakievich)
                 were you the one who allowed him down?

       Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung.  But Renard is
       looking past him now, as with a quiet WHIRR, the BOMB raises
       into view on a trolley.  Renard's team is ready to move.

                           RENARD
                     (to Akakievich)
                 Take him away, I don't want him around as
                 we move the bomb.
                     (whispered, to Bond)
                 You had me.  I knew you couldn't shoulder
                 the responsibility...

       And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his
       collar-bone hard...  Pain jolts through Bond, he drops to his
       knees in agony. He shoves Bond down.  Bond's hand goes to his
       shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him
       there?

       Renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving
       passageway.  It's all too much for Colonel Akakievich:

                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH
                 No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until
                 I am satisfied.  All of you to the
                 surface, now...

       Renard stops and turns.  Bond sees him nod to two of his men:
       one quietly slopes off down the tunnel.  The other innocently
       opens a container...

       INT. CONTAINER

       Camera shows the INSIDE of the container's lid; the man
       releases a false lining to reveal several MACHINE GUNS...

       INT. TEST CHAMBER - DAY

                           RENARD
                     (urgent now)
                 Very well, Colonel. We will all go up.

       One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that
       Bond should get up.  Knowing it's now or never, Bond PUSHES
       him away, yanks a PISTOL from his holster, GRABS Christmas,
       LEAPS down into the bomb PIT just as

       RENARD'S MEN open fire...  Akakievich dies straight away.  So
       do two of his men.  The gunfire RICOCHETS around the chamber
       and ceases.

       Renard hangs back.  His radio crackles a message:

                           RENARD
                     (nods, into radio)
                 Shut them.

       THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE RADIO

       Right next to the ELEVATOR.  He turns a switch that activates
       two sets of red buttons and two sets of green.

       He punches one green button...

       INSIDE TEST CHAMBER

       Heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel.

       INT. THE PIT

       Bond and Christmas know they are being sealed in.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Melt-down doors.  If he gets them closed,
                 they won't be opened again for forty-
                 eight years.

       Bond peers over the edge -- sees Renard and his men working
       the nuclear device into THE PASSAGEWAY.

       INT. THE PIT

       If Bond doesn't get through now, they're trapped forever.  He
       points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses
       a button...THE TINY GRAPPLING HOOK shoots out, Q's super
       filament wire that can hold up to 800 pounds is
       attached...Bond uses the rope to RAPPEL UP THE SIDES OF THE
       PIT and into

       INT. TEST CHAMBER

       Where he LEAPS ON TOP OF Renard's last man.  They fall
       THROUGH THE IRIS, it SHUTS behind them.  The man swings his
       machine gun at Bond -- it hits the wall next to him, breaks
       apart.  Bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one
       strike.

       He pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket,
       retrieving...THE CARD-LIKE DEVICE.

       INT. PIT

       Christmas looks around, desperate to help.  Using Bond's
       wire, she climbs up to the CLOSED IRIS DOOR.  She pries open
       a panel next to it and reveals complex WIRING...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY

       Up ahead of Bond, the bomb disappears down the passageway. He
       can see it is attached to A PULLEY above, helping the men to
       move quickly, Renard, pulling, the two men pushing

       Renard signals one of them to drop back to cut off Bond...

       Machine-gun fire turns the wall next to Bond to dust -- Bond
       dives to a recess.  An overhead LIGHT SHATTERS.  His section
       of the tunnel darkens.

       INT. PASSAGEWAY - BOND'S END

       Bond looks up at the broken LIGHT.  Takes careful aim at the
       next one along.  BLAM.  It disintegrates.  Again...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY - RENARD'S END

       The other guy answers with another spray of bullets.  Watches
       uneasily as Bond takes out light after light.  A funnel of
       darkness coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach.
       Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the
       void.  To keep it lit, he keeps firing...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY

       WITH BOND as the bullets cease with a loud CLICK...  What
       Bond was waiting for.  He moves.  The gunman frozen in the
       light, grappling to fit another clip --

       BLAM!  He goes down.  Bond not wasting bullets.

       INT. OTHER END OF PASSAGEWAY

       Renard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a
       switch on the panel by the elevator.  The IRIS starts closing
       on Bond...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY

       Bond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he
       shot lunges.  Clings to him.

       Bond hits him away, he LEAPS for the cart blocking his way
       and SHOVES IT INTO THE IRIS DOOR just as it almost closes...

       Bond squeezes through...

       INT. OTHER SIDE OF IRIS

       Renard is getting in the ELEVATOR.  Sees Bond made it, fires.
       Bond rolls into a corner.

                           RENARD
                 We have our fireworks.  Now you can have
                 yours.

       And he machine-guns some barrels.  Rocket fuel spills out.
       He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the
       metal so more fuel cascades out.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. CATWALK ABOVE PIT

       Christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her IRIS
       DOOR OPENS...

       AT THE ELEVATOR

       Bond fires at Renard, hitting his shin...

       WITH RENARD

       looking down at his shin, noticing the blood.  Inconvenienced
       but not in pain.  He shuts the cage doors.  Pauses only to
       fire off half a clip at the SWITCH PANEL.  Shreds it.

       Bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the
       elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile. He POINTS
       DOWN...underneath him...

       Bond looks down.

       HIS P.O.V.  BENEATH THE ELEVATOR...A makeshift explosive
       device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set
       to explode

       Eyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch
       panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires.

       INT. LIFT SHAFT

       The pipe bomb ticking...

       INT. PASSAGEWAY BY ELEVATOR

       Bond is trapped.  He looks up...

       THE PULLEY HOOK HANGS DOWN...

       He jumps up, grabbing it, just as...

       KABOOM!

       The bomb ignites the spilled oil, A FIREBALL shoots along,
       scorching after Bond, who is SAILING THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY,
       the force of the blast sending him hurling down the
       passageway ON THE PULLEY...heading straight for:

       A CLOSED IRIS DOOR which miraculously begins to OPEN as he
       SHOOTS THROUGH...

       Ahead, the next door is OPEN as well. He sees CHRISTMAS on
       the other side...

       HER P.O.V.  Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a MASSIVE
       FIREBALL...

                           BOND
                 Close the door!  Close the door!

       But before she can, two of the FUEL BARRELS HURTLE through
       the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire
       below.

       Flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them.

       Bond looks up, sees the ARM OF THE ROBOT LIFTER, stretching
       upward toward an old SHAFT t the top of the ceiling...

       He and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the
       spider-like web that supported the bomb and find...

       AN OLD ELEVATOR...powered by a hydraulic system...

       They get in...hear the rumbling of the fire below...the old
       elevator moves slowly...the rumbling grows louder...

                           BOND
                 Shame you had to spot I wasn't the real
                 thing.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 So who are you?

                           BOND
                 Bond --

       Bond FIRES HIS GUN at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and...

       THE ELEVATOR shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as

       BELOW THEM...THE PIT EXPLODES...

       INT. ELEVATOR

       Fire shoots up. Bond lunges to cover Christmas. As the smoke
       clears:

                           BOND
                     (finishing)
                 James Bond.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. MESA - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct.  Through a cloud of
       dust he can see people running about, panicked.  There's been
       some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground.

       Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way.  The plane.
       It roars past, level with them.  He follows it with his eyes,
       helpless as it gets smaller and smaller...

                           CHRISTMAS
                 They won't get far. Every warhead has a
                 locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a
                 high-pitched signal on Russian emergency
                 frequencies. We can track the bomb.

                           BOND
                 With this?

       Bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to
       her.  It flashes in the sun.

       Christmas shakes her head, disgusted.

       OMITTED 170 - 172

                                                          DISSOLVE:

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - DAY

       Busy.  Analysts huddle over monitors showing satellite
       images, trying to track the plane.

                           M
                 Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

                           TANNER
                 Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq,
                 Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

                           M
                 Marvellous.

       Moneypenny enters...

                           MONEYPENNY
                 Elektra King is calling from Baku.

       M is surprised.

                           MONEYPENNY
                 It's a video line.

                           M
                 Put her on the wide screen.

       The face of ELEKTRA materializes on a large WALL MONITOR.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I'm sorry. I would never call you
                 except...Bond's disappeared. He...he left
                 my villa, some time in the middle of the
                 night and...

       M exchanges a look with Tanner.

                           ELEKTRA
                 My head of security has been found near a
                 local airstrip, murdered...

       M leans on the console in front of her.

                           M
                 I'll send someone out.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Could...could you come?

       M looks up.

       ELEKTRA, on the monitor, looks about as lost as she ever has.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I just can't help thinking...I'm next.

       M stares at the girl's face, her whole sordid history written
       there.  M turns away from the screen and says to Tanner...

                           M
                 Get me out there.


       OMITTED:174 - 201

       EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA, BAKU - STORM APPROACHING

       Elektra's villa against blue-black storm clouds, the Caspian
       choppy, wind blowing.

       INT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - BAKU - DAY

       Elektra works in her father's STUDY, illuminated by a halo of
       light from a single desk lamp. Pictures of her grandfather
       and father stare down at her from the walls. The wind BLOWS A
       WINDOW open.

       She gets up, crosses the room, shutting the window.  She
       stands there, listening to the silence and then...

       SHE HEARS A THUD. A strange, unsettling thud.

       She listens, a long time, to the silence.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Gabor...?

       She goes to the door, opens it...it whines on its hinges.
       She steps into...

       INT. LIBRARY

       A big room lined with books. Three french doors lead out to a
       balcony.  She walks a few paces in...

       THE DOOR SHUTS BEHIND HER, she whirls...

       GABOR, propped up behind the door, stares, wide-eyed, before
       he FALLS TO THE FLOOR.

       Elektra gasps, she turns again...

       A DARK FIGURE LOOMS, a shadow against the windows.  He moves
       forward, his face becoming visible...IT'S BOND.

                           ELEKTRA
                 James!

       She stares at him, shocked, hesitant.

                           BOND
                 You look surprised.

       She moves to Gabor, gets down to help him.  He stirs, he is
       alive, but unconscious. Elektra looks up at Bond.

                           ELEKTRA
                 What's wrong with you?  Are you crazy?

                           BOND
                 A little. Does it matter? After all,
                 what's the point of living if you can't
                 feel alive?  Isn't that right, Elektra?
                 Isn't that your motto?

                           ELEKTRA
                 What are you talking about?

                           BOND
                 Or did you steal it from your old friend
                 Renard?

                           ELEKTRA
                 ...what?

                           BOND
                 We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about
                 us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew
                 exactly where to hurt me...

       Elektra stands...she begins to tremble.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Are you saying...Renard is the man who's
                 trying to kill me?

                           BOND
                 You can drop the act, it's over.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I don't know what you're talking about!

                           BOND
                 I think you do.

       He walks toward her, threatening...

                           BOND
                 At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome.
                 It's common in kidnappings.  A young
                 impressionable victim. Sheltered,
                 sexually inexperienced. A powerful
                 kidnapper skilled in torture, in
                 manipulation. Something snaps in the
                 victim's mind. The captive falls in love
                 with her captor.

       At the word "love," Elektra explodes.  She SLAPS an
       unsuspecting Bond hard across the face.

                           ELEKTRA
                 How dare you!  How dare you! That
                 animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me!
                 You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt
                 you, is that it? You had a sling on your
                 arm at the funeral! I didn't have to
                 sleep with you to find that out.

                           BOND
                 He used your exact words.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You knew.  You knew all the time, that he
                 was out there, that he was coming for me,
                 and you lied. You used me, you used me as
                 bait. You made love to me -- what, to
                 pass the time as you waited for him to
                 strike?

       He has no answer.  He can't deny what she says.

       The phone rings, cuts through the tension.  Bond and Elektra
       staring at one another.  She lets it ring...  Then picks up.
       Listens, looks to Bond.

                           ELEKTRA
                 He's struck again.
                     (beat)
                 Five men are dead at the pipeline.

       He moves toward her.

                           BOND
                 I'm coming with you.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You do what you have to do, but I've
                 called in M.  She's en route from London
                 even now.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - DAY

       The MI-6 chopper lands.  We can see M through the window.
       Face set hard.

       EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - MOMENTS LATER

       SCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked
       around a medium-sized industrial plant.

       Bond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices.
       All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area.

                           M
                     (to Bond)
                 Glad to see you've turned up.

       He is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency.

                           BOND
                 They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a
                 scientist here from the International
                 Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.  She
                 has ten crews combing the area.

       They step out of the bright sunlight and into

       EXT.\INT. CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

       FIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers.  M surveys
       the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several
       men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters.

       ELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman
       explain what's happening.  She nods acknowledgement to M.

       Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone:

                           TANNER
                 I'll see how they're coming with the
                 power...

       They watch him go.  M turns to Bond:

                           M
                 You had your hand on the bomb and you let
                 Renard get away with it.

       He draws her away, to a small alcove.  Takes something out of
       his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD.

                           BOND
                 The report King bought. It's a manual.
                 Renard's men used it to remove this radio
                 tracking device from the warhead.

                           M
                 Then Robert was right about a Russian
                 connection.

                           BOND
                 They're getting their weapons from the
                 Russians, but where are they getting the
                 money to buy the weapons?  I can't help
                 thinking...the person close to King, the
                 one who switched that pin...

                           M
                 The inside man?

                           BOND
                 Is maybe...the inside woman.

       NOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity
       of their exchange.  The room is lined with MONITORS and a
       huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path.

                           M
                 A woman?

       But before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A
       DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 That's not right.

       A Technician comes over.  Tanner too, followed by Bond and M.

                           TANNER
                 What is it?

                           ELEKTRA
                 It's an observation and repair rig.
                 Travels along the pipe, checks for broken
                 seals.  But it's not supposed to be
                 there.

                           BOND
                     (thinks)
                 Stop it.

       The Technician flicks two switches.  The light continues to
       flash.  Confused, he tries others.  No change.

                           TECHNICIAN
                 I don't understand...

                           M
                 Where is the rig?

       Harried, the Technician activates the wall schematic of the
       pipeline.  A pulse of light travels along the line. And with
       it, a sense of horror descends...

                           M
                 The parcel's in the post.

                           TANNER
                 It's heading for the oil terminal.

                           M
                 Where it can do the most damage.

                           ELEKTRA
                 My God.
                     (to one of her men)
                 Have the terminal evacuated.

       The man gets on the phone...

                           BOND
                     (to Tech)
                 Speed?

                           TECHNICIAN
                 Full on.  Seventy miles an hour.

       He punches buttons. Christmas has come, stands next to Bond.

                           TECHNICIAN
                 One hundred and six miles from the
                 terminal.

                           BOND
                     (quick)
                 It'll reach the other end in seventy-
                 eight minutes.
                     (to Tech)
                 Any more of these rigs?

       The Technician checks his records, looks up, nods.

                           TECHNICIAN
                 There's one parked in the passageway
                 ahead of it.

       Decisive, Christmas heads for the door, turns to her team:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 I'll need some help...

       Her IDA colleagues look sheepish.  Bond moves to her.

                           BOND
                 Come on.

       For just a moment, Christmas looks wary:

                           BOND
                 Unless you'd like to see my ID first.

       She almost smiles.

       M nods to Tanner to follow them.  Bond doesn't look at
       Elektra.  But she watches him go...

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

       The MI-6 helicopter swoops along the pipeline...

       Tanner is beside the pilot.  Bond and Christmas in the back.

       They look at one another, the danger ahead melting the frost
       between them.

       INT. PIPELINE - LATER

       Bond and Christmas climb through an access hatch down onto
       the electric RIG.  Its lights blaze fifty yards into the
       tunnel.  Then darkness.

       Christmas takes the driver's spot, Bond the rear, nearest to
       the approaching BOMB.  Tanner leans in:

                           TANNER
                     (sealing them in)
                 Good luck.

       Bonds nods, checks his watch.  Christmas looks nervously down
       the pipe.

                           BOND
                 Be one along any minute.

       And she starts the machine off...

       INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING)

       It quickly picks up speed, its lights flooding the seemingly
       endless pipe before them.

       Christmas looks behind, apprehensive.  Waiting for the lights
       of the explosive rig.

       It's tense.  They travel along, expectant...

                           BOND
                 When this is over we should bury the
                 hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?

                           CHRISTMAS
                 When this is over our bodies may be blown
                 to smithereens.

                           BOND
                 Alright then, brunch.

       His lightness relaxes her, she appreciates it.


       INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

       Elektra, M, and others. The room is crowded with concerned
       personnel.  M watches the two blips on the schematic getting
       closer together. One of her MEN approaches, a radio in his
       ear.

                           RADIO MAN
                 Tanner reports Bond is headed for the
                 rendezvous.

                           M
                 Excellent. Evacuate Miss King and the
                 others.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You can evacuate my workers, but I'm not
                 going anywhere.

       M looks at her, then nods, impressed by her courage.

       INT. PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

       Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly.  Tense silence.

       Finally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER.  Lights appear
       behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig
       tearing through the pipe.

       Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas'
       speedometer...she's only at fifty...

                           BOND
                 Faster! Get our speed up!

       Christmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward
       the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer...

       Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact.  He cushions the
       blow with his feet.  Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS
       ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across.

       The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Tactical fission device.  Low yield.

       They look at one another, then set straight to work.

       INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

       The room is quiet, tense.  M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor,
       the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the
       doors. They are the only ones left.  Going down with the
       ship...if it goes.  M and Elektra watch the two lights now
       together on the console.  A tense silence.  Everyone's edgy.
       Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest.  She exchanges a
       glance with Gabor.

       INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

       CLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB:  the timer.  1:45 MINUTES.

       Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're
       attempting.  The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29...

       OMITTED 217-218

       INT. PIPELINE - DAY

       The rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see.  But
       WHOOSH!  As the rigs hurtle past...

       INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

       The pipe suddenly dips.  They cling on as the machine bucks
       like a rollercoaster.  Back on a straight...

       Her brow furrows.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The plutonium is missing.  They've taken
                 the core!

                           BOND
                 Then it's no longer a bomb?

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (back to work, urgent)
                 It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if
                 the trigger charge goes off...

       Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel.

       He stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43...  Makes a decision.

                           BOND
                 Let it blow.

       Christmas shoots a look, astonished.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But we can stop it.

       Taking her arm...

                           BOND
                 Let it blow.

       She can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an
       INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead.

                           BOND
                 Trust me.  Leave it.

       He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb.

       INT. PIPELINE - DAY

       The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking
       her with him.  They tumble along the pipe.  Agile, Bond
       springs to his feet, pulls her up.  They run like hell for
       the hatch, into the darkness...

       EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

       The pipeline.  A long beat, then...

       KABOOM!!  A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in
       every direction.

       As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has
       been destroyed.

       OMIT 223

       INT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME

       On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from
       the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP....

       The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio
       earpiece in his ear, reports information.

                           GABOR
                 It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud.
                 The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard
                 section of pipeline...

                           M
                 And Bond?

       An agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies.

                           GABOR
                 Nothing.

       M and Elektra share a look.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Do you think he's dead?

       M can't answer.  She shakes her head.

                           M
                 We just have to wait.

       M shifts. The hi-tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red
       lights on every screen, showing the explosion.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to M)
                 I have a gift for you.  Something that
                 belonged to my father. He would have
                 wanted you to have it.

       M feels uneasy.

                           M
                 Perhaps this isn't the time...

                           ELEKTRA
                 Please.

       She hands M a small box.  M unties the ribbon.

                           ELEKTRA
                 He often spoke of how...compassionately
                 you advised him on the best course of
                 action during my kidnapping.

       M opens the box.  It is THE EYE OF THE GLENS...the heirloom
       pin, the original.

                           ELEKTRA
                 It's very valuable, you know. I just
                 couldn't let it explode with the rest of
                 him.

       M looks up, horrified, when:

       GABOR AND ANOTHER SECURITY MAN SHOOT M'S TWO GUARDS IN THE
       HEAD...point blank, cold blood.  The men fall.

       M looks back at Elektra, a blood-curdling glare.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to her men)
                 Take her to the chopper.

       EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

       From on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it
       disappears in a VAST, SMOULDERING BOMB CRATER.  Beyond, the
       pipeline continues unperturbed.

       Two TINY FIGURES on the banks of the crater.

       CLOSE ON THEM

       Bond and Christmas, very much alive.  She's angry.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What the hell were you doing?  You nearly
                 killed us!

                           BOND
                 I did kill us. She thinks we're dead.
                 And she thinks she got away with it.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What the hell are you talking about?

                           BOND
                 It's part of some plan. She dresses it up
                 like a terrorist attack.  The explosion
                 covers up the theft of the plutonium.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Who's she?

                           BOND
                 Elektra King.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is
                 her pipeline.

                           BOND
                 Makes her look even more innocent.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (skeptical)
                 What would she want with weapons grade
                 plutonium?

                           BOND
                 I was hoping you could tell me.

       Christmas stares at him.  Wheels turning.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 You steal an old bomb, small by today's
                 standards, about the size of the one that
                 destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium
                 core out of it, intending to use it...
                     (beat)
                 To make a bigger, better bomb.

       They're both chilled by the thought.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 I have to get after that core.  This is
                 my ass.

       She starts fiddling with the radio. Suddenly there's a
       CRACKLE.

                           TANNER
                 Tanner to 007, do you read?

       Bond grabs the radio.

                           BOND
                 Loud and clear.  I have to speak to M.

                           TANNER
                 She's gone.

                           BOND
                 What?

                           TANNER
                 She's disappeared.  And two of our men
                 have been killed.

       It impacts on Bond.  His eyes harden.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What is it?

                           BOND
                 She just upped the stakes. All her chips
                 are on the table now.  And M's life is
                 part of the bet.

       He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly
       snake with the world for its bed.

                           BOND
                 I know I promised you champagne, but
                 would you settle for caviar?

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - ISTANBUL - TWILIGHT

       A boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast
       body of water (in fact, the Bosphorus).

       Renard disembarks with several of his retinue, heavily laden
       with bags and cases.  They enter the tower...

       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

       A fantastic space:  stained glass windows cast myriad
       patterns over elaborate tile and marble surfaces.  Pillars,
       iron lattices, velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge
       room.

       As they enter, Elektra swoops across the floor and into
       Renard's arms.  He holds her.  She pushes him away.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You're hurting me.

       He senses something different between them.  She tries to
       hide it.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Brought me something?

       He smiles, grabs a case off one of his men, opens it up,
       pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal.

       She looks at it with wary fascination.

                           RENARD
                 Go on.  It's safe.  Touch your destiny.

       She traces a finger along the metal.  A flicker of wonder:

                           ELEKTRA
                 Warm.

                           RENARD
                     (pointed)
                 Is it?

       She's sensitive to his buried frustration:

                           ELEKTRA
                 I've brought something for you as well.

       INT. ROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

       Elektra opens a heavy door, she and Renard past through to...

       A SMALL ROOM...a window set in the stone on one side.  The
       other side is divided off by a WALL OF BARS, creating a cell
       which now contains: M

       The cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner. M
       betrays no fear.  A quiet defiance burns in her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Just as I promised.

       Renard steps forward.  Bars separate him from M.

                           RENARD
                 My executioner.

                           M
                 Over-praise, I'm afraid.  But my people
                 will finish the job.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Your people? Your people will leave you
                 here to rot just like you left me. You
                 and my father. He didn't think my life
                 was worth the chump change he spent on a
                 day at the stock market.

                           M
                 Your father...

                           ELEKTRA
                 Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my
                 mother. The kingdom I will rightly take
                 back.

       Elektra leaves.  Renard is left alone with M.

                           M
                 She's insane.  Is that what you did to
                 her?

                           RENARD
                 No. I'm afraid it is what you did.

       He crosses close to the bars.

                           RENARD
                 When I took her she was...promise itself.
                 So clever, so vibrant, so...full of life
                 force. And you left her there, at the
                 mercy of a man like me. You ruined her.
                 For what?  To get to me? She is worth
                 fifty of me.

                           M
                 For once, I agree with you.

       He shakes his head, amused by her pluck.

                           M
                 So she used all that brilliance to get
                 revenge on her father, on me.

                           RENARD
                 No. I wanted you. I wanted you for
                 myself.

       He takes something out of his pocket.  A small TRAVEL CLOCK.
       He sets it.

                           RENARD
                 Since you sent your man to kill me, I
                 have been watching time tick slowly away,
                 marching inevitably toward my own death.
                 Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow,
                 your time is up. And I guarantee you...I
                 will not miss.  You will die. Along with
                 everyone in this city and the future of
                 the West.

       He places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach
       through her bars.  He leaves.  We hold on the clock:

       Eight p.m.


       EXT. CITY OF WALKWAYS - BAKU - DUSK (OLD SC. 174)

       Valentin Zukovsky in the back of his chauffeured Rolls
       Royce...  We PULL BACK, to take in an amazing sight:  the car
       is on a network of raised walkways and platforms that extends
       as far as the eye can see.  A decaying legacy of the Soviet
       years.

       EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.175)

       Zukovsky limps purposefully away from his Rolls along a
       walkway leading to a Beluga fishery built over the water.

       INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.176)

       Nailed on the battered old door, the lid of a caviar jar, a
       label illustrated with a LINE DRAWING OF ZUKOVSKY. Zukovsky
       opens the door and finds himself...

       Staring straight down Bond's pistol.  Bond and Christmas are
       silhouetted by the gold dusk light.  At their feet lies one
       of Zukovsky's workers.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress
                 this innocent thing?

                           BOND
                 She's no innocent.  This is my nuclear
                 consultant.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic
                 relationship.

       Hands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening
       dress decidedly out of place here.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice
                 Russian scientist with hair growing out
                 of his ears?

                           BOND
                 What's your business with Elektra King?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I thought you were the one in her
                 business.

                           BOND
                 She dropped a million and half dollars to
                 the House -- your House. And you didn't
                 even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you
                 off.  What for?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 As ever you are the spy who has to see a
                 plot wherever he looks.

       Bond SLAMS Zukovsky hard against a vat of caviar.  Wood
       splits, roe spills onto the floor.  Zukovsky is appalled.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!

                           BOND
                 You are out of your league.  She's
                 working with Renard.

       Christmas moves in, intense but firm:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 They've stolen a nuclear device.

       A subtle change in Zukovsky's countenance.

                           BOND
                 Tell us what you know, Zukovsky.  Tell
                 us, before its too late.

       But it may be already:

       The SOUND OF A HELICOPTER.  Zukovsky frowns, the SOUND
       GETTING LOUDER --

       Bond is the first to move as --

       INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - NIGHT (OLD SC. 177)

       -- wood suddenly splinters everywhere -- the wall and roof
       tear open behind them - GIANT VERTICALLY-SUSPENDED SAWS RIP
       THROUGH, just missing them.

       THE SPINNING TEETH (OLD SC. 178)

       The blades churn through the corrugated roof, spraying CAVIAR
       everywhere.

       EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS (OLD SC. 179)

       Bond BURSTS OUT OF THE BUILDING...Zukovsky and his guards and
       even the chauffeur are firing at the chopper...

       EXT. RAMP TO LOWER WALKWAY (OLD SC. 180)

       Bond makes for his BMW, running down a flight of steps, onto
       a lower walkway when...THE SECTION AHEAD OF HIM
       EXPLODES...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a
       thrown grenade.  Bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the
       only way out is ALONG THE PIPELINES...he runs along a narrow
       section of pipe and then JUMPS DOWN to another walkway.  The
       PIPES are now above him...the chopper's relentless saws CUT
       THROUGH THE PIPE...GAS JETS OUT...Bond HURLS HIMSELF up a
       stairway.

       INT. CAVIAR FISHERY

       Zukovsky and Christmas watch in horror as Chopper One blades
       away more roof above them.

       EXT. LOWER WALKWAY

       Bond takes something out of his pocket, a remote control
       device...he presses some buttons...HIS CAR COMES TO
       LIFE...lights on, it drives toward him.

       He rushes to meet it. Chopper Two follows behind Bond,
       slicing up the walkway just behind him.  Bond gets to the car
       and JUMPS IN as the chopper veers away.

       INT. CAR

       Bond activates his missile device as he watches Chopper Two
       pass behind the factory.  Suddenly there's a huge roar behind
       him as the blades from Chopper One RIP THROUGH THE ROOF,
       SLICING HIS CAR IN HALF.

       But Bond is undeterred.  He sets off the missile toward the
       disappearing Chopper One.

       EXT. CHOPPER

       A DIRECT HIT. Chopper One explodes and falls onto the walkway
       setting the scene ablaze.

       EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

       Zukovsky and Christmas see the explosion, then see Chopper
       Two dropped FOUR ARMED MEN onto a nearby walkway.  The men
       make their way toward the factory, firing at the guards.
       Zukovsky and Christmas are forced inside.

       ANGLE ON BOND

       Who sees the danger to the others and runs off along the
       walkways back to the factory.  The Chopper follows him,
       shooting.

       Bond outruns it, until, ahead of him A GRENADE EXPLODES,
       destroying the walkway and hurling Bond into the water.

       EXT. FACTORY

       The gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's
       guards. Then, two of the assailants follow ZUKOVSKY and
       CHRISTMAS into...

       INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

       The chauffeur is shot and killed.  The gunmen then turn their
       attention to Zukovsky and Christmas, when suddenly BOND
       APPEARS through a trap door in the floor boards.

       Bond shoots one of the gunmen, then fires on the other...
       Zukovsky grabs Christmas and they make their escape  Bond
       sees a third gunman firing from the basement and takes him
       out.

       EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

       Zukovsky and Christmas make a dash for Zukovsky's Rolls.
       They dive in...Zukovsky rams the car into reverse...behind
       him, A CHOPPER SLICES the walkway to smithereens...Zukovsky
       can't stop it as the car leaps backward and into THE WATER
       BELOW....

       INT. FACTORY

       Bond finishes off the remaining two armed men in a furious
       gunfight and exits.

       EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

       Bond sees Zukovsky and Christmas swimming to safety.  The
       chopper bears down on him.  He leaps back to what's left of
       the building, picks up a flare gun.  He jumps down to a
       walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted GAS JET...he
       then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it
       approaches Bond for the kill....

       Bond fires the flare gun...

       THE GAS EXPLODES!

       The Chopper tries to pull away, but it's too late.  The
       flames engulf it, igniting a fireball.

       IN THE WATER

       Zukovsky pulls himself back onto a walkway and heads for the
       factory, but speeding at him are to FREE-FLYING SAW BLADES
       from the chopper that has just exploded!

       OMITTED 231S to 231Z

       EXT. WALKWAY

       Zukovsky dives away -- into a CAVIAR PIT.  The saws embed in
       the cabin behind him.

       The caviar pit is like sinking sand, deep -- he's going
       under.  Flounders, trying to cling to a crate blown in there
       by the explosion.  Then he looks in horror:

       EXT. SIDE OF CAVIAR PIT (OLD SC. 199)
       POV ZUKOVSKY:

       Bond appearing at the edge of the caviar pit, dragging
       himself up, soaking wet.  He's holding another harpoon gun.
       Points it directly at Zukovsky.  This time he really means
       business.

       EXT. CAVIAR PIT/SIDE (OLD SC. 200)

       Zukovsky, on the point of being swallowed by the caviar,
       clawing at the crate.  Bond, steely eyed, cold:

                           BOND
                 Now...where were we?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 A rope!

                           BOND
                 No.  The truth!
                     (beat)
                 She thought I was dead -- those blades
                 were meant for you.  What do you know
                 that she would kill you for?

       Zukovsky is sinking.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I don't know what you're talking --

       Zukovsky sees Christmas appear beside Bond:

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Help me, don't let me drown.

       She looks to Bond -- sees he's serious.

                           BOND
                     (to Zukovsky)
                 You're in this thing up to your neck.

       Zukovsky sinks alarmingly -- he talks rapidly, staccato:

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle
                 machinery for her.  Russian stuff.

                           BOND
                 And the payoff on the tables?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 A special job.  A...a...a submarine.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is
                 Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.

                           BOND
                 Where's the sub going?!

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 No!  Get me out!

                           BOND
                 This is too big for even you.  Where is
                 it?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 This is a family matter! If my nephew is
                 in danger, we do it my way, or nothing!
                 Now get me out!

       But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with
       the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 No! Bond!

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (alarmed)
                 Bond!

       Bond fires.  Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM.

       It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the
       harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him.  He clings
       to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to
       safety.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Commander Bond, you are dangerous,
                 unpredictable, and a hothead.

       He just looks at her.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But then again, explosive devices are my
                 specialty.

       Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to
       the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind
       him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just
                 you, me and my people.

                           BOND
                 Where?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Istanbul.

       INT/EXT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT

       Beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views
       in the world -- on one side the still waters of the Golden
       Horn, on the other, the dancing waves of the unsheltered
       Bosphorus -- and in between, the tumbling roofs, soaring
       minarets and crouching mosques of the Pera district.

       RENARD scans the water with night-vision binoculars.

       EXT. BOSPHORUS - NIGHT - HIS GREEN POV:

       A SUPERTANKER churns along...

       ADJUST ANGLE

       The CAMERA SINKS BENEATH THE WAVES, steals through the gloom -
       - eventually comes upon something sitting just beneath the
       belly of the tanker.  The silhouette of a SUBMARINE, hugging
       the tanker's shadow, creeping undetected into the
       Bosphorus...

       INT. M'S CELL - NIGHT

       M paces her cell.  Looks out, at the clock:

       It is MIDNIGHT.  Twelve hours to go.

       She crosses her arms.  Returns to pacing.  Puts her hands in
       her coat pockets:

       She feels something.  Takes it out.

       THE LOCATOR CARD.  Black and shiny, with two copper terminals
       on one end.

       M taps it on her hand. She looks back out.  TO THE CLOCK.

                                                            CUT TO:

       INT. BEDROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT

       Renard and Elektra.  She is on the bed, Renard stroking her,
       worshipping her skin.

                           RENARD
                 So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.

                           ELEKTRA
                 How would you know?

       It stings him. Elektra sits up, pulling a robe around her.

                           RENARD
                 Why are you like this?  Because Bond is
                 dead?  It's what you wanted.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (beat)
                 Of course...

       Renard gets up.  Paces the floor.

                           RENARD
                 He was a...good lover?

                           ELEKTRA
                 What do you think?

       Renard leans against her desk, closing his eyes, squeezing
       out the images.  After a moment, he SMASHES HIS FIST through
       the hand-painted wood.  Elektra looks up.

       HER P.O.V.  A huge splinter of wood juts out of Renard's
       hand.

       Renard looks at it, curious, unfazed.

                           RENARD
                 Nothing.

       Elektra comes to him. Leads him to the bed.  Sits. Gently
       removes the splinter.  Then, she takes an icecube from the
       bucket.  Runs it along his wound.

                           ELEKTRA
                 What about this?

       And she runs the ice down his cheek.  He shakes his head.
       Tormented.

                           RENARD
                 Nothing.

       Now she runs the ice down her neck...

                           ELEKTRA
                 But surely...

       ...her fingers becoming wet, she runs the ice down between
       her breasts, leaving a trail.  Teasing...

                           ELEKTRA
                 ...You can feel this?

       She's moving the ice lower on herself... We see her lips
       open, enjoying the sensation.  A beat, then his smile slowly
       grows.  As she does something else.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (sensual)
                 Remember ... pleasure?

       Eerily quiet.  The calm before the storm, except:

       INT. M'S CELL - SAME

       M is at the door of her cell.  Her arm is stretched out
       through the bars.  She is using her high-heeled shoe to try
       to HOOK the leg of the stool and drag it toward her.  She can
       only jut tap the leg with the tip of the heel.  She swipes
       out at the little three-legged stool, tapping it, tapping
       it...

       It scoots toward her a little...she taps it again, gets her
       shoe HOOKED on the leg of the stool and starts to drag it
       when...

       The rickety stool hits a bump on the ancient stone floor and
       SPILLS OVER...the clock HITS THE GROUND and SKIDS across the
       stones, coming to rest ACROSS THE ROOM, on the floor near the
       window.

       M leans against the bars. SHE HEARS HER THE OUTER DOOR
       CLANKING OPEN...

       She hurries to her cot and lies down.

       GABOR ENTERS...a burly shadow in the light from the hall.  He
       walks in.  Looks at M.  Picks up the clock and sets it ON THE
       WINDOW SILL.

       He leaves, shutting the door behind him.

       M sits up. Looks out to the clock, glowing in the dark.

       IT READS TWO A.M.

       She drops her head back on the wall.  She will not sleep
       tonight.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

       EXT. ISTANBUL - DAWN

       ESTABLISH the vast city astride the Bosphorus.

       EXT. ISTANBUL STREETS - SAME

       The sun starting to rise.  Street vendors are the only people
       about, moving their carts into place, getting ready to place
       out their wares.  We hold on a BUILDING.

       INT. DYE FACTORY - SAME

       A multi-levelled, rickety old building full of colourful
       fabrics drying high overhead; the light shafts through them
       casting pools of different coloured light.

       It is a working factory, bolts of fabric and vats of dye, but
       it is also:

       AN OLD KGB SURVEILLANCE CENTER

       Pushed to one end of the large room are stacks of radio
       equipment, old consoles, audio equipment and radar screens.
       Once a high-tech surveillance center, it has gone to seed.
       There are men and women here, smoking, using the equipment,
       slightly dissolute, very sinister, where the only membership
       card is an old KGB ID.  Zukovsky is here, leaning behind a
       RADIO OPERATOR.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Any luck reaching Yevgeny?

                           OPERATOR
                 Negative, comrade.

       He moves to CHRISTMAS AND BOND, pouring over a large MAP OF
       ISTANBUL spread out on a table.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (to Zukovsky)
                 What is this place?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye
                 Factory was just a front; now it turns a
                 good profit.

       Bond notices THE BOA in the corner with some others.

                           BOND
                 Your old friend Dmitri.

       Zukovsky nods to his old friend.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Today, you are glad to have the Boa  on
                 your side.

       Zukovsky looks at the map.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 In the good old days, the KGB had three
                 or four spots where our submarines could
                 surface without anyone knowing. But
                 Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What class sub does your nephew run?

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 C-class.

                           BOND
                 Nuclear.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear
                 reactor.
                     (the penny drops)
                 He's not loading any cargo. They want the
                 sub. The sub itself.
                 Put weapons grade plutonium inside the
                 sub's reactor: Instant, catastrophic
                 meltdown.

                           BOND
                 Made to look just like an accident.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Mother of God.

                           BOND
                 The right kind of explosion in the right
                 spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut
                 off the Black Sea.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But why? Eight million people would die,
                 the land irradiated for a hundred years.
                 A cloud of radiation the size of
                 Europe...

                           BOND
                     (chilled)
                 Because an explosion like that would kill
                 all the other pipelines. There would be
                 only one way to get the oil out of the
                 Caspian and pump it to the world...

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The King pipeline.

                           BOND
                 Elektra would control it all.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 If what you say it true...it may be too
                 late for Yevgeny.

       INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY

       The ancient arched underbelly of a waterside building.

       Something is disturbing a large expanse of water.  A black
       shadow looms beneath the waves.  A SUBMARINE SURFACES.

       INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY

       Waiting at the newly excavated quay:  Renard and his men.

       The submarine's hatch opens.  A YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN EMERGES,
       vaguely resembling his uncle, Zukovsky.

                           RENARD
                 Captain...

                           YEVGENY
                 Sir. We are ready to load your cargo.
                 We only have a few hours before we'll be
                 missed.

                           RENARD
                 You came with a skeleton crew?

                           YEVGENY
                 That's all we can afford these days.

                           RENARD
                 Of course. We are grateful for your
                 efforts.

       One of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy
       and other food.

                           RENARD
                 We have brandy and other refreshments for
                 your men.

       The Captain nods, pleased.

       INT. DYE FACTORY

       Bond and Christmas and Zukovsky watch as the radio operators

                 If we're not in time and something has
                 happened to him... you must let me kill
                 them.

       Bond stares hard at him.  A long beat.

                           BOND
                 Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky.  They

       INT. SUBMARINE - DAY

       Eerie, dark, the lights inside green and sickly.

       CLOSE ON

       A half-eaten sandwich. An empty glass of brandy on the floor,
       just near the hand it fell from...

       PULL BACK TO SEE

       The dead face of Yevgeny, poisoned.  Others of his crew
       around, also dead.

       Renard and his men tour the grisly scene.

                           RENARD
                 Take them up and throw them in the sea.

       As they drag Yevgeny away, his HAT falls on the ground.
       Renard picks it up and PUTS IT ON HIS HEAD.

                           RENARD
                 We'll be underway in two hours.  Use that
                 time to re-familiarize yourselves with
                 your stations. Then ponder how rich
                 you'll be.  The re-breathers for the
                 escape are already on board.

       A man appears holding a heavy lead box containing the
       plutonium.  Renard takes the box as if it weighs nothing.
       Stronger then ever.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Now you know how it feels.  To be locked
                 away, to wonder if they're coming for
                 you, if anyone will ever come for you.

                           M
                 Someone will come.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.

       Elektra walks to the window.  She looks out.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Somehow, I find that strangely
                 ...disappointing.

       M watches her, her heart beating.

                           M
                 Elektra. What time is it?

       Elektra picks up the little clock. Walks over to the cell
       bars.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Time for you to die.

       And she reaches through the bars and HANDS M THE CLOCK.

       The two women's eyes meet.

                           RENARD
                 The reactor is secured.

       She turns, sees RENARD in the doorway.  She crosses to him
       and SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT behind her.

       INT. OUTSIDE DOOR - MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

       Their eyes lock.

                           RENARD
                 This is the end.

                           ELEKTRA
                 No.  It is the beginning. The world will
                 never be the same.

       He lays the Captain's hat down. Tries to mask his sorrow.

                           RENARD
                 It will be yours, and yours alone. Have
                 fun with it.

       Forces himself to leave, heads down the stairs.

       INT. M'S CELL - SAME

                 The locator card. It's M.

       He takes the coordinates over to the map and DRAWS A

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Forty, forty-three degrees East...

       Bond draws another line across the map. At the point at which
       the intersect...a small island in the Bosphorus.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 The Maiden's Tower.

                           BOND
                 How appropriate.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I'd heard there were some renovations
                 there...no one would look for a sub in
                 that place in a million years.

       Suddenly Bond's instinct are aroused.  Out of the corner of
       his eye, he sees THE BOA set something on the ground and move
       slowly UP THE STAIRS.

       Bond looks at the pack he left on the ground...

       He grabs Christmas and HURLS HER TO THE FLOOR.

       KABOOM!

       A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rips the place apart.  In half a second
       the air is thick with coloured dust and drifting clumps of
       burning silk.

       Bond stands.  Christmas is stunned, but okay.  He looks
       around at the others - few dead, all out for the count, among
       them, Zukovsky.

       Bond heads for the door after the Boa.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Zukovsky...

                           BOND
                 If I don't get to the Boa before he gets
                 to Maiden's Tower, M is dead.

       Bond runs out, into

       EXT. STREET - DAY

       Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA
       climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF.

       Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the
       top of the roof...

       Boa has now been joined by THREE THUGS.  One attacks Bond as
       the Boa and the others move away...

       Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof,
       gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and
       THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls...

       EXT. BAZAAR

       Into the market below.

       Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body
       falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond...

       But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth.

       She turns and runs...the thug gives chase...

       ON THE ROOFS ABOVE

       Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from
       roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of...

       EXT. MOVING BUS

       Motoring rapidly away from him.  He makes a spectacular leap
       to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus,
       dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the
       overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks.

       ON THE BUS

       Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him.
       They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus
       speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy
       over...

       The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS...

       Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has
       climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with
       his gun when...

       THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug
       Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly
       ELECTROCUTED.

       Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond
       time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE
       BUS...

       EXT. STREET

       Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast
       moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van
       and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR.

       ON THE BUS

       Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them.

       The bus is hissing to a stop.

       The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.  Bond rushes
       forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.  The taxi
       jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to
       the street.  He springs to his feet.

       Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for
       traffic.  The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley.

       EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY

       The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water
       pipes and drink coffee.  The Boa is nowhere to be seen.

       Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his
       leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the
       cafe.

       EXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY

       Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the
       back.  He looks inside - just a few children  at play.  Bond
       is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which
       brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun -
       but the Boa knocks it out of his hand.

       The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from
       behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail.
       He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach.

       Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it.
       Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across
       the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.

                           BOA
                 For years I was told I could never take
                 the great James Bond and his Walther PPK.
                 What good is your gun now, Bond?

       Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.  He slumps
       forward, his left hand touches something hot.  It's the iron
       basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.  Bond's
       fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.  He
       grabs it and with his last reserves -

       Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side
       of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT
       SKILLET.

       The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of
       his face.  Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying
       to clear his head.

       The Boa runs out the back door.  Bond finds his gun, holsters
       it and follows.

       EXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY

       Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND
       SHOPPERS.  Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the
       crowd to...

       EXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY

       RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.  Bond enters square in
       time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian
       steamer.

       As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to
       the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo
       net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom.

       EXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY

       Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck.  He lumbers across it
       but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by
       Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck
       house.  The Boa goes sprawling.  As Bond comes for him he
       scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and
       swings at Bond.  But Bond is ready for him.  He wards off the
       blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.  He
       traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks
       in the solar plexus.  He Boa stages back to the railing.  A
       final kick from Bond sends him over the side...

       THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A
       SICKENING THUD.

       Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his
       neck broken.

       Bond sighs, turns...

       GABOR is there. Gun trained on him.

                           GABOR
                 Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.

       BOND'S P.O.V.  A thug steps into sight below, holding
       CHRISTMAS hostage as well.

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

       A magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus.

       An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it.  A tarp is raised
       and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound.  They are
       helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen.

       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

       Elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open.  Kisses Bond
       on the cheek as she eyes Christmas.

                           ELEKTRA
                 James Bond and his amazing resurrection.
                 If only you'd kept away, we might have
                 met again in a few years, become lovers
                 once more.

       Christmas eyes Bond anew as Elektra leads him to an ornately
       carved chair, covered in silk.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to guards)
                 Take her to Renard.

       Bond and Christmas exchange a look as the guards start her
       towards some steps.

       Elektra indicates for him to sit.  Behind him, the whole of
       Istanbul is visible through a large curved window.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Pretty thing.  You had her too?

       Bond ignores her.

                           ELEKTRA
                 I could have given you the world.

                           BOND
                 Not interested.

       This cuts. She casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a
       wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar.  A GAROTTE.

                           ELEKTRA
                 They were digging near here and they
                 found some very pretty vases.  They also
                 found this...
                     (meaning the garotte)
                 I think we ignore the old ways at our
                 peril, don't you?

       Bond recoils as she fastens the collar...  She steps back.

                           BOND
                     (ignoring her)
                 Where's M?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Soon she'll be everywhere.

       Bond keeps his cool:

                           BOND
                 All this, because you fell for Renard?

                           ELEKTRA
                 Five more turns and your neck will break.

       She moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw ONE
       NOTCH.  The effect on Bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts
       into the back of his neck, tilts his head back.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Since I was a child, I've always had a
                 power over men. When I realized my father
                 wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I
                 knew I had to form a new alliance.

                           BOND
                     (realizing)
                 You turned Renard.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (smiling)
                 Just like you...only you were even
                 easier.

       She pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar:

                           ELEKTRA
                 I told him he had to hurt me, he had to
                 make it look real. When he refused I told
                 him I would do it myself.

       She turns the screw again.

                           BOND
                 So you killed your father.

                           ELEKTRA
                 He killed me! He killed me the day he
                 refused to pay my ransom.

       A flicker of emotion.  Bond is getting to her.

                           BOND
                 Was this all about the oil?

                           ELEKTRA
                 It is my oil!  Mine and my family's!

       Her eyes are shining.  She moves toward the view, gazing out
       at this spectacular cradle of civilization.  Bond works his
       wristbinds feverishly.

                           ELEKTRA
                 It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.
                 I'm going to redraw the map.
                 And when I am through the whole world
                 will know my name, my grandfather's name,
                 the glory of my people.

                           BOND
                 No-one will believe this melt-down was an
                 accident.

       She eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan.
       Tightens the screw again.  Her confidence amazing.

                           ELEKTRA
                 They will believe.  They will all
                 believe.

       Tightening the screw again:

                           ELEKTRA
                 You understand? Nobody can resist me.

       Now she straddles him.  She puts the jewel back on her ear.
       All the time, he's working that wristbind.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Know what happens when a man is
                 strangled?

                           BOND
                 Elektra, it's not too late.  Eight
                 million people needn't die.

       She smiles, twists the screw again.  A nasty, grinding sound.
       Sweat trickles from his brow.  She licks it away.

                           ELEKTRA
                 You should have killed me when you had
                 the chance.  But you couldn't. Not me.  A
                 woman you've loved.

       She pushes her hips into his.  Turns the screw.  The bolt is
       jammed right into the back of his neck.  His face is angled
       upwards.  Breathing is difficult.  He glares up:

                           BOND
                 You meant ... nothing ... to me.

       She fingers the bolt.  Prepares to turn it the last
       time...His hand strains at its binding...

                           BOND
                 One... last... screw?

                           ELEKTRA
                     (kissing his ear)
                 Oh James.

       She begins to turn the screw...

       ... when SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are heard outside.

       Bond is on the edge of consciousness.

       Elektra freezes.  Gets off him.  Moves to a window.

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY
       HER POV:

       Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a
       boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of
       his men.  Two bodies in his trail.  He's on course for
       Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his
       henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.

       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Elektra moves to her gun.  Just then, Gabor crashes through a
       stained glass window, neck broken.

       TWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors
       burst open.  Zukovsky stands there.  A bloody giant.

       They open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky
       take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder.  Right
       now, he's unstoppable.

       A shocked silence after the shooting.  He eyes Bond in the
       chair.  To the room:

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 I'm looking for a submarine.  It's big
                 and black, and the driver is a friend of
                 mine.

       Then his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from
       below.  He knows at once what it means.

                           ZUKOVSKY
                 Bring it to me.

       She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun
       beneath it).  She proffers the hat...

                           ELEKTRA
                 What a shame.  You just missed him.

       BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat.

       He staggers back.  Stares.  Slumps down.  Lowers his head to
       the ground.

       She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down,
       smiling a half-psychotic smile.  The gun is pinned.

       Zukovsky is dying.

       But he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun
       a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already
       pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as
       Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going
       to shoot Bond!

       Bond stares back.  Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for
       extreme accuracy...

       BLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist.  Splinters
       the wood there.

       ELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky.  She didn't see where the bullet
       went, just that it missed Bond.  She watches his head slump
       further, staring at Bond...

       A look passes between the two men.  Comrades in arms.  The
       merest of smiles.  Then the light fades from his eyes.  Dead.

       ELEKTRA

       turns back to Bond.  Smiles.

                           ELEKTRA
                 Excuse me.

       She picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it:

                           ELEKTRA
                 Everything's under control up here.  Are
                 you ready?

                           RENARD
                     (filtered)
                 Yes.  Au revoir...

       Lost for a moment, she breathes heavily.  She glances at
       Zukovsky's corpse.  Slightly puzzled, to Bond:

                           ELEKTRA
                 Zukovsky really hated you.
                     (beat)
                 Time to say goodnight.

       And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer
       twist...

       One super-fast movement:

       Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight.  He holds
       her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls
       her backwards, her hand scratching at his face.

       Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet.  Moves
       to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his
       fingers.

       Turns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs.  A moment's
       dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to
       Elektra?

       He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset.

                                                            CUT TO:

       EXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY

       The submarine's engines roar to life.

       INT. TOWER - CONTINUOUS

       ELEKTRA rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading
       to the various balconies of the minaret tower.

       INT. TOWER/M'S CELL - DAY

       Bond stalks up after her.  THEIR VOICES ECHO through the
       intertwined stairs:

                           ELEKTRA
                 James.  You can't kill me.  Not in cold
                 blood.

       But Bond isn't wavering.  Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun.

       He heads up in the semi-darkness -- and suddenly swings to
       his right, at an unexpected but familiar Voice:

                           M
                 Bond --

       Bond kicks open a door and enters...

       M'S PRISON ROOM

       He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her. Turns to
       go, heading upward, after Elektra.

                           M
                 Go after the submarine, forget the girl.
                 Bond!

       INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Elektra has reached a balcony.  It affords a spectacular view
       of Istanbul.  Bond appears, has her cornered.

                           BOND
                 Call him off.

       He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth.

                           BOND
                 I won't ask again.  Call him off!

       She looks at him seriously.  He's giving her a last chance,
       willing her to save herself and the city.

                           ELEKTRA
                     (into walkie-talkie)
                 Renard.

       Bond waits...

                           ELEKTRA
                     (to Bond)
                 You wouldn't kill me.  You'd miss me.

       And her face breaks into a perverted grin and --

                           ELEKTRA
                     (into walkie-talkie)
                 Dive!  Bond --

       BLAM!  Bond shoots her.

       She staggers back, shocked at her own mortality.

                           BOND
                 I never miss.

       He looks out:

       EXT. BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half
       submerged.  The hatch is still open.

       INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       He stares at her dead body a beat. And then, he crouches. He
       touches her cheek, just once, before he goes.

       Behind him, unbeknownst, M has seen it all.

       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

       He moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and

       DIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water.  Amazing.

       EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - DAY

       He surfaces close to the exiting sub.  Grabs a ladder, pulls
       himself up.

       The hatch is closing...  He splashes through the water
       flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor
       shutting the hatch.  WHACKS him with the hatch.  Gets inside.
       Closes it.  Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the
       water.

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond down below. Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub.
       He creeps through...

       Approaches one man working some levers, smoking.  Bond holds
       his gun to his head.

                           BOND
                 How do you want to die?
                     (re:  cigarette)
                 That?
                     (re:  gun)
                 Or this?

       INT. CABIN, SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER

       A few SOLID BANGS on the metal of Christmas' door.  It opens
       and Bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck.  That was
       his head banging.

                           CHRISTMAS
                     (stunned)
                 James!...

       He takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of
       the sub.

       INT. SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER

       A man is operating the tanks.  Through the intercom:

                           RENARD
                     (filtered)
                 Flood tanks 4 and 5...

       The man does as told.  When he's finished -- Bond knocks him
       out with the butt of his gun.

       INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Several men occupy the central control room, Renard at their
       centre.  Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the
       reactor.

       INT. OTHER END OF CONTROL ROOM - SUBMARINE - DAY

       From the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas,
       so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor
       because there are so many men in there.

       Keeping behind cover:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Is there another way?

                           BOND
                 We go down to the torpedo bay.

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE LOWER DECK - MOMENTS LATER

       Bond and Christmas get attacked.  A vicious, silent fight...
       Then the radio set sparks into life --

                           RENARD
                 Open the tanks.

       Bond is throttling the man with the cable.  Speaks into the
       handset.

                           BOND
                     (disguising voice)
                 Tanks open.

       But the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm:

       The KLAXON RESOUNDS.

       INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Renard looks up.

                           RENARD
                     (to self)
                 Bond...

       He flicks a switch;

                           RENARD
                     (into mic)
                 Bond! You have decided to join me on this
                 historic voyage.  Welcome to my nuclear
                 family.

       INTERCUT:

       BOND ON AN INTERCOM:

       His voice fills the control room.

                           BOND
                 You're really going to commit suicide for
                 her?

       Renard responds, into the microphone.

                           RENARD
                 In case you've forgotten.  I'm dead
                 already.

                           BOND
                 Haven't you heard the news?  So is she.

       Renard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he
       could feel in his skin...he SCREAMS...

       INT. SUBMARINE...

       The scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the
       doomed craft.

       BACK ON RENARD, gasping, spent.

                           RENARD
                 You will die for this.

       He strides through to the

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       Jams shut the hatch behind him.  Now moves through to the

       INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR

       Where he picks up the PLUTONIUM. Moves back into the

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       Sealing the other door behind him.  And now he opens up the
       cover of the glaring REACTOR...

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas sees a panel light up:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 The cover is off the reactor.

       Bond reads off more lights...

                           BOND
                 He's sealed himself in.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 He's going to insert the plutonium.

       Thinking fast, Bond moves to some controls.  Hits switches.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Do you know what you're doing?

                           BOND
                 Like riding a bike.

       INT. AIR TANKS, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       The air tanks immediately filling with water.

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas and Bond shift to the side.  Everything not screwed
       down starts sliding...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS - LONG SHOT

       The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose
       dropping down and down...

       Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a
       submarine hanging vertically, nose down.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the
       nearest wall.

       INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip.  He helps her up.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 What kind of bikes did you ride?

                           BOND
                 Just wanted to put him on edge...

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Renard is disturbed by the sub's position, but only
       momentarily.

       He moves to an intercom:

                           RENARD
                 Open the torpedo tubes.

       INT. TORPEDO ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Bond hears a creak, turns to see the tubes open -- water
       gushes up toward them at an incredible rate.

                           BOND
                 Climb!

       He pulls Christmas up and they ascend to the next level.  No
       chance to seal the chamber though, the water is already
       through the hatch.

                           BOND
                 Keep moving.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Renard now struggles back up to the reactor, stares into the
       violet blue heat...

       He hits a button.  A ROD slowly rises out of the reactor.

       INT. LOWER SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Bond and Christmas are ahead of the water.  They have reached
       a level where various systems are operated from.

                           BOND
                 There's one chance.

       He punches buttons.

       EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS

       High up on the sub, a hatch opens.  Water floods into an
       escape hatch.  An inner door stops it getting into the
       submarine itself.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod.  Immediately the
       light around him becomes a deeper blue, a horrible
       luminescence.  The staccato click of a distant Geiger counter
       intensifies.

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       As Bond opens the inner door of an ESCAPE HATCH, he points
       out a cabinet on the wall to Christmas.

                           BOND
                 Re-breathers.

       She opens the box to find the RE-BREATHERS are ripped to
       shreds.  No-one was ever meant to get off the sub.  She shows
       Bond.

                           BOND
                 Never liked those things anyway.

       He climbs into the escape chamber.

                           BOND
                 Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty
                 open the hatch.  It can only be opened
                 for a few seconds or we'll sink.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 But what if...

                           BOND
                 Count to twenty.  I'll be there.

       She moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which
       immediately floods the chamber with water.

       INT. ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

       Inside the chamber, Bond holds his breath as water seeps in.
       The most claustrophobic thing you've ever seen.

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       A green light comes on and Christmas punches a button...

       EXT. SUBMARINE, ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

       The OUTER DOOR opens...  Bond burst out and starts the long
       swim up the OUTSIDE OF THE SUBMARINE...

       INT. SUBMARINE - SAME

       Christmas is counting.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 One, one thousand, two, one thousand...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER

       It's dark out here.  It would be very easy for Bond to get
       disoriented.

       He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast
       vertical whale he's swimming up.

       Passes the conning tower.

       INT. SUBMARINE

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one
                 thousand...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER

       Bond is running out of air...

       And then he sees it -- the open hatch of the rear escape
       door.

       He gets inside, yanks it closed...

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       Christmas, shivering in the rising water.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Twenty.

       She presses a button...

       INT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

       The hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water.
       The hatch closes.

       The whole world is at a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at
       the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses.

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

       Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor,
       Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of
       the door...

       KER-BLAM!  A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

       The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond.

       Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard,
       now a crumpled heap in the corner.

       Bond moves down to the next door, opens it:

                           BOND
                 Christmas!

       And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still
       rising...

       He lowers an arm, pulls her up.

       They clamber up to the reactor:

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       BOND'S POV: in the intense glow inside -- the overheating
       rod, protruding slightly.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 We have to get the rod out of the
                 reactor!

       INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

       Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD.
       Christmas comes up level with him:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Melting down.  4000 degrees, the
                 Zirconium casings on the rods crack.
                 5000, the plutonium melts.  In ten
                 minutes, a hydrogen explosion.

       THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING...

       He starts toward the reactor when suddenly

       RENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM.

       CHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through
       the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life.

       THE GAUGE HITS 4700


       BOND AND RENARD

       struggle...  Both slamming into switches and buttons.

                                                            CUT TO:

       OMITTED 314-316

       INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

       THE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900, EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK
       5000 MARK.  Meltdown imminent...

       He looks down the sub -- more water racing upward...

       Back to the pile.  Scans the scene, searching for an idea.
       Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure.  Thinks
       fast.  Grabs the hose, snaps it free...

       RENARD

       is recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him.  Raises it to
       Bond...

       BOND'S POV

       in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from
       5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us...

       BOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air
       blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past --
       impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot.

       Renard stares at Bond in horror.  Bond calmly takes the flare
       gun off him.

                           BOND
                 She's waiting for you.

       And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open
       hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water.

       Christmas looks down at the floating corpse.

       Bond watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000.

       The nuclear disaster looks like it's averted.  But suddenly
       water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's
       shell; it's going to sink.

                           BOND
                 We're sinking.

       But she won't come.  As water courses over them:

                           CHRISTMAS
                 Help me.  We have to seal it.

       She moves to the reactor, closing the cover.  Bond uses his
       strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place.

       Bond climbs upwards, dragging Christmas with him.

                           BOND
                 We've got to get out.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 We can't.

       INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

       They clamber into the next chamber up...

       EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS

       The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down.  Air is escaping
       from the many seams that are creeping apart.  We can hear the
       metallic GROANS through the water.

       INT. TORPEDO ROOM

       Bond and Christmas crawl into TORPEDO CHAMBERS...

       Bond reaches out, setting a timer to FIRE...

       The clock ticks down...

       EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER BOSPHORUS - DAY

       The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are SHOT OUT
       INTO THE WATER, streaking through, as behind them...

       THE SUBMARINE EXPLODES in spectacular fashion.

       EXT. SURFACE, BOSPHORUS - DAY

       Bond and Christmas reach the surface...  Look around them.
       No boats coming to the rescue.  They wave to a tourist boat
       passing.

       The boat heads over to pick them up...

                                                          DISSOLVE:

       OMIT 324

       EST. SHOT - MI-6 - NIGHT

       The damaged wing is being repaired.

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME

       Tanner overseeing things, and then...

       M walks in.  Efficient and steely as ever.  All eyes turn to
       her.  She looks at everyone...makes the briefest of nods.
       That is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes.

       She scans the machines:

                           M
                 Any word from him?

                           TANNER
                 Still no contact yet.

       EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - NIGHT

       A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.
       Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger.

       FIREWORKS explode above. They clink glasses.  He looks out at
       the cityscape.

                           BOND
                 I love Christmas in Turkey.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 So isn't it time you unwrapped your
                 present?

       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

       Tanner and Q look at a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE OF ISTANBUL.

                           TANNER
                 That's strange.

       The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a
       side street.  We can just make out Bond's ASTON MARTIN.

                           TANNER
                 He must be nearby.

       M comes over.

       The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop.
       The thermal image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher.

                           M
                 Where?

                           Q
                 This picks up body heat.  Humans should
                 be orange.
                     (searching)
                 There.

       And he points to ONE orange figure lying on the rooftop.

                           M
                     (to Tanner)
                 I thought you said he was with Doctor
                 Jones?

       They all look back to the image.  The figure is turning RED,
       almost glowing.

                           M
                 It's getting redder.

       Tanner, Q and M realize as one that this is an image of two
       people, one atop the other.  And getting hotter.

                           M
                 Bond.

       Q switches the screen off, clears his throat.

                           Q
                 Could be a premature form of the
                 Millennium Bug.

       EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - CONTINUOUS

       It's dark, we can't really see them.

                           CHRISTMAS
                 You know James...  I think Christmas is
                 coming early this year.

                                                           FADE OUT

       THE END

                                     August 26, 2001

                                       Third Draft

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. PRAGUE - NIGHT

               On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is 
               spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones 
               and medieval walls.

               A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley.

               There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly 
               heard from inside.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies 
               from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

               He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES.

               A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE.

               THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below.

               EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

               As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins, 
               sure he's heard something.

               But there's nothing there. He continues on.

               Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.

               WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.

               The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled 
               features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is 
               STERLING.

                                     STERLING
                         I hate to drop in unexpectedly.

               Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE 
               from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks 
               it away.

               Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO 
               underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see 
               the "ASTON-MARTIN" LOGO.

               As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and 
               flattens against the wall.

               A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.

               The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.

               BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.

               Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in 
               the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading 
               towards.

               As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He 
               smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd.

               INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

               Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's 
               stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT.

               We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a 
               bizarre German industrial-metal band.

               The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix 
               over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted 
               with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE 
               OUTFITS.

               Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd. 
               With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken 
               coop.

               ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young 
               GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL 
               with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic 
               Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA.

               Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL 
               PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside.

               He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With 
               that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is.

               They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod.

               Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone.

               Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction.

               Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE.

               Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing 
               through the freaky crowd.

               EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

               Sterling's ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb.

               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - MOVING - NIGHT

               Sterling is at the wheel of his spy car. He plugs the DATA 
               CHIP into the dash and punches buttons. A computer screen 
               says "DATA DOWNLOADING".

               He sees a BLACKED-OUT SUV racing up behind him.

               He accelerates and hits a SWITCH.

               ARMORED PLATING slides up over the rear window.

               EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

               The SUV is right behind him. Viktor rolls down the passenger 
               window, readies his PISTOL.

               The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.

               They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.

               Sterling skids around a corner.

               The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass 
               and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.

               The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.

               Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.

               A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is 
               ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.

               Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts 
               BLASTING.

               BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof 
               glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!

               Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on 
               the RIMS.

               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - IDLING - NIGHT

               Sterling notices an ERROR MESSAGE now flashing on his computer 
               screen: "TRANSMISSION ERROR: - DATA PARTIALLY SENT".

               Sterling looks around desperately. Somehow he's got to get 
               this data out of here.

               Straight ahead is the RIVER. Chugging up the river: a PARTY 
               BARGE.

               PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra. A SWIMMING 
               POOL is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing.

                                     STERLING
                         Time for a slow boat to China.

               He hits a BUTTON.

               EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

               The rear license plate folds down, revealing a ROCKET ENGINE.

               Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator.

               Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.

               SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at 
               ever increasing speed.

               Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!

               But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic 
               looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE 
               GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded 
               SNIPER.

               Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a 
               SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.

               The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It 
               ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.

               We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.

               On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on 
               the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.

               The missile locks-in and FIRES...

               HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots 
               GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car.

               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - FLYING - NIGHT

               Sterling sees the missile streaking at him.

                                     STERLING
                         Oh bloody hell!

               EXT. THE RIVER - NIGKT

               WHOOMPH! The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air.

               Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down on 
               the deck.

               Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT.

               Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands 
               on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD 
               BUFFET.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C.

               A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn 
               and SPEED OUT OF TOWN.

               We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In 
               the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK 
               BUILDINGS.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Inside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS 
               DOWN to a deep basement level.

               The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG 
               strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African-
               American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks 
               sturdy, confident, deadly.

               At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR.

               INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT

               Gibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL 
               SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES 
               on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything.

               If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from 
               down here.

               Gibbons takes an elevator up.

               INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting 
               the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking 
               down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief, 
               looks down at the activity below.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Come.

               Gibbons enters, stands by the desk.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Evening, Sam.

               Sam remains in shadow.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         What do you have?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Not a whole helluva lot. His final 
                         transmission was mangled. About 
                         something or someone called "Ahab". 
                         Whatever it is, it cost him his life.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         He was the best there was. That makes 
                         three agents lost.

                                     GIBBONS
                         They're ruthless and they have a lot 
                         of firepower. It's only a matter of 
                         time before they figure out how to 
                         deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna 
                         have a catastrophe on our hands.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Silent Night in the hands of a bunch 
                         of impertinent cowboys

                                     GIBBONS
                         We're gonna have to step in, Sam. 
                         Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown 
                         in a field of cactus. Let me take 
                         care of it.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         How will you fix it?

                                     GIBBONS
                         I'll go in with a team. But first 
                         I'm going to need some intel. I'll 
                         have to put someone inside, someone 
                         new, someone they won't see coming. 
                         One of their own.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         So you'll dredge the bottom again. 
                         You've done that before. The results 
                         were... uneven.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You wanna find out about rats, ask a 
                         rat. I've had my people put together 
                         a talent pool. I downloaded it to 
                         your desktop.

               Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts 
               cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN.

                                     GIBBONS
                         The usual prospects. Convicts, 
                         contract killers, murde...

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         The scum of the Earth.

                                     GIBBONS
                         But programmable. And expendable.

                         I've seen enough. Turn it off.

               Gibbons clicks off the screen.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         They're degenerates. There's not a 
                         man in there that would give a damn 
                         if the Chinese took over.

                                     GIBBONS
                         That's exactly why we need them.

               Sam sighs, stares out at the information room.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Get these "scum", Mr. Gibbons, bring 
                         them in. Test them. Train them. Find 
                         your man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

               The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky.

               We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take 
               position behind a FOUNTAIN.

               ACCOMPLICE #2 (CAREY HART) sneaks across a roof and takes 
               position overlooking the fountain position of #1.

               ACCOMPLICE #3 (DAVE MIRRA) takes up position in the second 
               story window of a FLOPHOUSE HOTEL down the street.

               A MESSENGER (BOB BURNQUIST) skates up to the front of the 
               skyscraper with a PACKAGE. He gets the attention of the 
               SECURITY GUARD inside. The Security Guard unlocks the door 
               and lets him in.

               Just then a VAN pulls up and ACCOMPLICES #4 (SHAUN PALMER) 
               and #5 (MAT HOFFMAN) hop out. They open up the back and a 
               BICYCLE is rolled out of the back by a MAN IN A HOODED JACKET.

               Jacket Man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the 
               lobby.

               INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - NIGHT

               The Security Guard is checking his computer.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Crump... I'm sorry, no one by that 
                         name.

               K The Guard glances up as Jacket Man gets into an ELEVATOR.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey! You can't go up there!

               The Security Guard rushes to intercept him. The Messenger 
               kicks his skateboard out, TRIPPING UP the Security Guard.

               The Messenger hauls ass out the door. The Security Guard 
               pulls out his WALKIE-TALKIE.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         We've got an intruder in the express 
                         elevator!

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               The button for "91 - ROOF ACCESS" is lit up. Jacket Man waits 
               patiently.

               INT. 91ST FLOOR - NIGHT

               This fancy office is empty for the night. The STAIRWELL DOOR 
               opens and a PLATOON of SECURITY GUARDS rushes in. They take 
               Up position in front of the elevator doors armed with BILLY 
               CLUBS and TASERS.

               DING! The elevator arrives and the door swings open. But 
               there's NOBODY INSIDE.

               One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN 
               from the ceiling, TAGGING HIM IN THE FACE. He falls back, 
               TASERING another Guard.

               Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the 
               chaos before the Guards know what hit them. There's a CURVY 
               PIECE OF ART in the room, some kind of modern art statue.

               Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a 
               TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER. He hits the ground pedalling, 
               the Guards hot after him.

               Jacket Man enters a HUGE OPEN ROOM with a FIELD OF CUBICLES 
               in the middle. He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A 
               STOP. He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him 
               for the first time.

               He is XANDER CAGE. He's got a shaved head, bizarre TATTOOS 
               all over his body and multiple PIERCINGS. He's lean and 
               heavily cut, even dangerous looking.

               The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the 
               CUBICLE WALL. This thing is maybe FOUR INCHES WIDE and FIVE 
               FEET TALL.

               He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards 
               scrambling after him.

               Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of 
               cubicles and pedals hard. The Guards fall all over themselves 
               trying to catch him.

               At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE 
               TABLE. He does a WHEELIE across it's length with Guards 
               closing in.

               Xander springs up and does a TAIL WHIP, knocking them back 
               with his rear wheel. He lands and pedals to the stairwell 
               untouched.

               EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

               Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST 
               BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA. He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM.

               From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn 
               with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS.

               Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him.

               Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his 
               back and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest. He pulls out a ROAD FLARE 
               and SPARKS IT. We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his 
               SPOKES.

               He LIGHTS THEM with the flare. Then he TOSSES THE FLARE off 
               the building.

               EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

               The Accomplices see the flare drop. #'s 1, 2 & 3 pull CAMERAS 
               OUT and start filming.

               EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

               Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal. He evades 
               Security Guards, picking up speed.

               With Guards right behind, he drops off the TOP PLATFORM and 
               lands on a massive SATELLITE DISH.

               Using the dish as a ramp, Xander LAUNCHES himself OFF THE 
               TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.

               He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end 
               over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...

               He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a 
               flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and 
               night lights.

               The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's 
               own chest camera, in SUPER 8 and DIGITAL VIDEO, from four 
               different angles.

               Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets 
               towards the ground.

               At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his PARACHUTE 
               OPENS.

               EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

               The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement.

               It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest.

               Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and 
               #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the 
               van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape.

               As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS 
               OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike.

                                                                   SLAM TO:

               TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing 
               TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop 
               we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF-
               PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street 
               SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that 
               tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

               Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's 
               smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another 
               BACKPACK on his back.

               EXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

               Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building.

               INT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his 
               motorcycle into the loft.

               There are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls, 
               MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere 
               there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description.

                                     XANDER
                         Sky, you there? Start packin' cause 
                         we are out of here!

               There's a NEATLY FOLDED FLAG hanging in a slightly crooked 
               FRAME on the wall. Xander straightens it as he goes by.

               He hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back 
               there.

                                     XANDER
                         Did I promise you a fat vacation or 
                         what? Get ready to get down in 
                         paradise.

               He comes into the bedroom to find SKY, his long-suffering 
               girlfriend. She's a wannabe artist type. She's got SUITCASES 
               and BOXES scattered around and she's PACKING.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, you don't need all this just to 
                         go on vacation. Unless this ain't 
                         for going on vacation...

                                     SKY
                         I'm through, Xander.

                                     XANDER
                         I can see that. Why?

                                     SKY
                         You run around with maniacs jumping 
                         motorcycles in the desert, you break 
                         36 bones crashing wave runners and 
                         snowboarding off cliffs, all with no 
                         health insurance... It's insane, I 
                         can't take it anymore.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm having fun, what's the problem?

                                     SKY
                         You have all this talent, and you 
                         waste it. You won't take a single 
                         endorsement deal. Meanwhile those 
                         other guys have their own video games! 
                         But no, you've got too much 
                         "integrity" for that.

                                     XANDER
                         I don't wanna go mersh, you know 
                         that. But hey, if this is about 
                         money...

               He opens up the backpack, revealing WADS OF CASH.

                                     XANDER
                         I got an advance on the next bootleg. 
                         Let's get out of here, just you and 
                         me. We'll chill out in Bora Bora for 
                         a couple months.

               She sorts through the money.

                                     SKY
                         French Polynesia? This wouldn't last 
                         us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you 
                         know how expensive it is down there?

                                     XANDER
                         Alright, so I'll get more.

                                     SKY
                         It's not about the money, X! You 
                         never plan for anything. I can't 
                         live like that anymore, I need some 
                         stability.

                                     XANDER
                         Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd 
                         better give you your surprise now.

               He pulls off his shirt. Pierced through his nipple is a 
               DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                     SKY
                         What...?

                                     XANDER
                         I was gonna wait till the islands, 
                         but...

                                     SKY
                         You're serious?

                                     XANDER
                         Of course I'm serious. I bought it, 
                         didn't I?

                                     SKY
                              (shakes her head)
                         This is so typical. I can't believe 
                         you. I've barely seen you for the 
                         last three weeks and now this? Are 
                         you out of your mind?

                                     XANDER
                         I don't know. I thought this is what 
                         you wanted. You want stability, here 
                         it is.

                                     SKY
                         You can't just propose to me out of 
                         nowhere. You think that's going to 
                         solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It 
                         was a kick for a while, but it's 
                         over. You're just not going anywhere.

                                     XANDER
                         You're not exactly "going anywhere" 
                         yourself.

                                     SKY
                         You're wrong about that. I'm heading 
                         out that door right now.

               She heads towards the front door.

               Just then the door BLOWS IN.

               CRASH! -- the windows SMASH IN too. Then the LIGHTS GO OUT 
               as STORMTROOPERS in black body armor rush in, weapons drawn.

               It's a blur of FLASHLIGHTS, PISTOLS and JACK BOOTS. It's 
               scary as hell. A professional take-down.

               They slam Xander against the wall.

               Just like that it's quiet again. Sky hyperventilates, a gun 
               in her face.

                                     XANDER
                         She had nothing to do with the tower 
                         jump. She's nobody. I just met her 
                         last night. Tell them.
                              (with meaning)
                         I hardly know you.

               The Stormtrooper looks at Sky. She nods. The Stormtroopers 
               take their guns off her.

               Sky grabs up here stuff. She looks back at Xander.

                                     SKY
                         Keep the ring. It looks better on 
                         you anyways.

               She heads out.

                                     XANDER
                         God, I hate cops. What's the charges 
                         this time?

               The Stormtrooper pulls out a DART GUN and SHOOTS Xander. He 
               pulls a CHROME DART from his chest, examines it.

                                     XANDER
                              (groggy)
                         You... pussies...

               Xander slides to the floor.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. PAN'S DINER - DAY

               A SIDEWAYS IMAGE: an out of focus COFFEE CREAMER.

               Xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a DINER. He 
               shakes out the cobwebs.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell?

               WHIP PAN as a WAITRESS walks by. Xander blinks.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?

                                     WAITRESS
                         I don't know, you wandered in ten 
                         minutes ago and put your head down. 
                         I told you we were closing.

               Xander looks around, sees a TRUCKER chewing with his mouth 
               open. A SALESMAN buried in his NEWSPAPER.

               Xander gets up. Where the hell is he? He takes a step towards 
               the door.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Want some coffee?

                                     XANDER
                         Huh?

               The Waitress pours him coffee. QUICK PUSH TO: her hands are 
               shaking.

                                     XANDER
                         You alright?

                                     WAITRESS
                              (smiles)
                         Fine, just fine. Come on and sit. 
                         I'll get you something to eat.

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, sure.

               Xander sits. When he swigs his coffee, he notices something 
               written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "S.O.S."

               What the hell? He looks at the Trucker. The Trucker's staring 
               at the waitress. QUICK PUSH TO: The Trucker has a BULGE 
               underneath his vest... then PUSH TO: The Salesman's eyes 
               darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose. 
               Something is going down...

               He hears a SLOWED DOWN VOICE and glances back at the Trucker, 
               who's now fixing him with a DEATH STARE. Xander snaps from 
               his reverie.

                                     XANDER
                         What?

                                     TRUCKER
                         I said, you got a problem, boy?

                                     XANDER
                         Problem? No, no problem. You go right 
                         ahead.

                                     TRUCKER
                         With what? I said, go right on ahead 
                         with what?

                                     XANDER
                         Whatever, dude.

               The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other. Suddenly 
               they jump up.

               The Trucker pulls a PISTOL from his vest, the Salesman 
               brandishes the SHOTGUN he had behind the paper. The Waitress 
               cringes.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Alright, nobody make a move!
                              (to Xander)
                         Shoulda walked away when you had the 
                         chance, dumb shit.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Forget him, Buck, let's just do it.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Shut up!
                              (in Xander's face)
                         You keep still or I'm gonna make 
                         damn sure you stop breathing today. 
                         Got that?

               Xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused.

                                     XANDER
                              (shrugs)
                         Alright, "Buck", whatever you say.

               The Waitress let's out a whimper.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty 
                         that register! Couldn't just let him 
                         leave, could ya! You know what I'm 
                         gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do 
                         ya?!

               She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses 
               on the floor. Xander springs into action.

               He CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the 
               face.

               Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out 
               from under him.

               The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.

                                     XANDER
                         Better shoot me quick.

               The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. 
               Xander advances on him.

                                     XANDER
                         Too late!

               He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw.

               The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors.

               Xander turns to the terrified Waitress.

                                     XANDER
                         Alright, bitch, what's going on?

               She stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun.

                                     XANDER
                         Talk! What's the game? Who are you 
                         people?

               The front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored 
               suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem, 
               Mr. Cage?

                                     XANDER
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     GIBBONS
                         The name's Gibbons. You were saying?

                                     XANDER
                         What is this place?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Looks like a diner.

                                     XANDER
                         Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the 
                         problem is. I wake up drugged to 
                         find what? You've got a "salesman" 
                         over here reading a three week old 
                         newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a 
                         "trucker", who happens to be packing 
                         a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped 
                         that something is going down when 
                         she passes me a note. How's that for 
                         twisted logic? How did she know there 
                         was trouble unless they pulled the 
                         guns before I "walked" in? And if 
                         that's true, why'd they stop and 
                         wait until I woke up to gaffle the 
                         money? Then I notice how beefy they 
                         both are. Hell, even the waitress is 
                         cut. All three of them look like 
                         they went through the same training 
                         program. Ergo they ain't strangers 
                         and this isn't what it seems. That's 
                         how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round 
                         off even if I gave him all day. Why?

               He aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt.

                                     XANDER
                         Cuz there's nothing but blanks in 
                         these guns. And no offense, but their 
                         performances were terrible.

               Xander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly 
               smile.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.

               Gibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the 
               background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Most guys we ran through this either 
                         took off or helped them rob the place. 
                         I expected you to do the same.

                                     XANDER
                         That shows me already that you don't 
                         have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Whether you thought this was for 
                         real or not, you jumped in and helped 
                         the waitress on instinct. That tells 
                         me something about your character.

                                     XANDER
                         Good for you. Now why don't you stop 
                         wasting my time and tell me what you 
                         want. You didn't go through all this 
                         for my benefit.

                                     GIBBONS
                         It's your lucky day. You just might 
                         get the chance to pay back our 
                         wonderful country for all the freedom 
                         you enjoy.

                                     XANDER
                         A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else 
                         would have this kind of budget? Now 
                         you're gonna hit me with the sales 
                         pitch.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Alright, Cage, you've got me. This 
                         is one of those moments. "Many are 
                         called, few are chosen", that kind 
                         of thing. Your government needs you. 
                         Are you up for the challenge?

                                     XANDER
                         ..If you're trolling around for narcs, 
                         man, have you got the wrong guy.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Why is that?

                                     XANDER
                         Look at me, dude, do I look like a 
                         fan of law enforcement? Forget the 
                         tests, you shoulda just asked me. I 
                         woulda saved you a lot of trouble.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Oh I don't know, I think the tests 
                         work pretty well. Sometimes they 
                         give me answers you wouldn't admit 
                         to in a million years.

                                     XANDER
                         Are we done now? You've got nothing 
                         on me. So if you ain't booking me, 
                         I'm walking.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You've got this wrong. You're not 
                         under arrest, you've been abducted. 
                         And until I say different, you belong 
                         to me.

                                     XANDER
                         Is that a fact?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling 
                         about you from the start, Cage. It's 
                         nausea.

                                     XANDER
                              (smiles)
                         You know what I hate? Any scumbag 
                         with a clean shirt and a bad haircut 
                         can get one of those tin stars and 
                         suddenly they think they're God.

                                     GIBBONS
                              (smiles)
                         You know what I hate? It's always 
                         the assholes that pass the tests.

               There's a POP and Xander clutches his stomach. Gibbons tosses 
               his DART GUN onto the table. Xander blinks at him.

               He pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it.

                                     XANDER
                         You bastards love to see me sleep.

               WHACK! He goes face down on the table.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               CLOSE ON - XANDER'S FACE

               He comes to, blinking in low RED LIGHT. He's shocked to find 
               that he's...

               INT. AIRPLANE - TWILIGHT

               Xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. TWO OTHER TOUGH 
               GUYS are waking up next to him. One's a greaser named VIRG, 
               the other is T.J., ex-Navy.

               Xander notices as they each pull out CHROME DARTS. They sit 
               up, looking at each other. Xander chuckles.

                                     VIRG
                         What's so damn funny?

                                     XANDER
                         Been to any good diners lately?

               The three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.

                                     T.J.
                         We must be the final "candidates".

               They quiet down as they notice for the first time, THEY ARE 
               NOT ALONE.

               Sitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED 
               IN BLACK. They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces. They are a 
               nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM.

                                     XANDER
                         Nobody told me this was a costume 
                         party.

               The Black Ops Team, just stares.

                                     T.J.
                         I've worked with guys like this 
                         before. Black Ops. Serious government 
                         spooks.

               Virg notices something STRAPPED TO HIS BODY. They all have 
               them.

                                     VIRG
                         Heads up, man. What's this thing on 
                         my back?

                                     XANDER
                         A parachute. This does not argue 
                         well.

               Then the red light switches to GREEN.

               One of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR. The rest of the 
               team advances on Xander, Virg and T.J.

                                     VIRG
                         This is bullshit! Hey!

               They drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT. T.J. goes next, 
               kicking and fighting.

               Then they turn on Xander.

                                     XANDER
                         I get the picture.

               Xander jumps out on his own.

               We see him tumbling away from the airplane. Far below his 
               chute BLOSSOMS OPEN.

               EXT. A FIELD - TWILIGHT

               We see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD.

               We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro.

               The other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in 
               SPANISH.

                                     VIRG
                         Jee-zus, man! What the hell now? 
                         Another damn test?

                                     T.J.
                         We should head for those trees.

                                     XANDER
                         Don't look at me, brother. It's every 
                         man for himself.

               They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as 
               they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

               Xander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around.

               He flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees 
               stuns him.

                                     XANDER
                         You gotta be kidding me.

               We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE 
               PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place 
               looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM.

               NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's.

               Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING.

               A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move.

               He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the 
               HEADLIGHTS of a truck.

               Narcos hop out and charge forward.

               Xander raises his hands.

                                     XANDER
                         You boys are too good for me. Guess 
                         I failed this one, huh?

               They grab him and haul him away.

               INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

               We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it.

               Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander.

               He's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are 
               BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy 
               HAY.

               Behind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both 
               HOG-TIED.

                                     XANDER
                         So much for "every man for himself". 
                         Nice to see you again, fellas.

                                     T.J.
                         They really went all out on this 
                         one. This is a pretty gnarly setup.

                                     VIRG
                         Check the table in the corner.

               There's a BLOOD STAINED TOWEL COVERING a TABLE near the door.

                                     XANDER
                         This oughta be good.

               Then they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED.

               A very nasty looking Marco comes in. By his look he's the 
               LEADER.

                                     XANDER
                         This must be el jefe. How's it goin' 
                         jefe? Some weather we're havin'.

               Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on 
               the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them.

               Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are 
               HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT 
               CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH.

                                     XANDER
                         What's on the menu tonight? The old 
                         blowtorch-to-the-family jewels 
                         routine, I'll bet. Hey, you want 
                         roasted nuts, let's break out the 
                         Planters.

               T.J. and Virg both crack up. Jefe gives them a withering 
               look.

                                     JEFE
                         Do you know what we do with people 
                         come round here? You know what we do 
                         with people come in our business?

               Jefe passes his hand over the various tools. He finally 
               settles on a crude MACHETE. He walks amongst them brandishing 
               it.

                                     JEFE
                         We cut the Achilles tendon. Your 
                         feet flop around like a marionette. 
                         You ain't walkin' nowhere no more.
                         Sound good, tough guy? Or maybe 
                         instead you wanna tell me something.

               He stops in front of Xander.

                                     JEFE
                         Whatchu doing here?

                                     XANDER
                         Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.

                                     JEFE
                         That's some accident, hombre. You 
                         accidentally fall out of a plane in 
                         the middle of the night and land up 
                         in my back yard.

               He BACKHANDS Xander across the face.

                                     JEFE
                         We seen this kind of parachutes 
                         before, you know. U.S. Army. You got 
                         some friends here, jump out with you 
                         guys?

                                     XANDER
                         We're anti-social. We don't have any 
                         friends.

               Jefe SLAPS him again.

                                     JEFE
                         No friends, huh? That's funny, I 
                         don't know no U.S. Army that comes 
                         without no friends. That's cuz U.S. 
                         Army is pussies. They always come 
                         with the five hundred guys and the 
                         helicopters and the see-in-the-dark 
                         glasses. So don't you tell me you 
                         all alone out here, my friend. You 
                         bullshitting the wrong guy.

               Xander looks over at T.J. and Virg.

                                     XANDER
                         Who's writing this dude's dialogue?

                                     VIRG
                         He's a pretty good actor, though.

                                     T.J.
                         Makes the diner look like a sixth 
                         grade play. He's even got them crazy 
                         eyes.

                                     JEFE
                         You ain't begun to see crazy yet, 
                         amigo.

                                     XANDER
                         We're on to the game, ese. You got 
                         the fake blood splattered all over 
                         the walls, you got your torture 
                         tools... It's all very cute. But 
                         come on, let's quit while you're 
                         ahead. I'm only trying to save you a 
                         beatin'.

                                     JEFE
                         You saving me? You talking pretty 
                         tough for a guy got himself chained 
                         to the ceiling.

                                     XANDER
                              (shrugs)
                         Alright. You wanna eat through a 
                         tube, be my guest.

                                     JEFE
                         Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, 
                         funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the 
                         whole foot off. Whatchu think of 
                         that?

               A low THUMPING is heard outside. It's the sound of approaching 
               HELICOPTERS, lots of them.

               Then the night ERUPTS in GUNFIRE. It sounds like a full scale 
               assault outside.

                                     JEFE
                         What's that, eh? I thought you didn't 
                         have no friends!

               Jefe goes into a fury. He SWINGS his machete at Xander's 
               legs.

               Xander JUMPS UP, grabbing on to the chain above, and KICKS 
               Jefe in the chest.

               Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof BEAM.

               He grabs onto the beam with his legs and UNHOOKS his chain 
               from the meat hook.

               He drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed 
               wrists, and Jefe comes charging at him.

               Xander dodges a few wild swings.

               He grabs Jefe's PANT CUFF and dumps him on his ass.

               Jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his PISTOL.

               Xander swings his chain and WHIPS the gun out of Jefe's hand.

               With another swing he WRAPS the chain around Jefe's neck and 
               pulls it taught.

                                     XANDER
                         Keys. You got 'em?

               Jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.

                                     XANDER
                         Hand 'em to me.

               Instead Jefe hurls them out the window.

                                     XANDER
                         I hope you're getting paid extra for 
                         this.

               Xander jerks the chain, slamming Jefe head first into the 
               wall. Jefe drops, knocked out.

               Outside it sounds like a full scale FIREFIGHT. Xander gets 
               the machete and CUTS the ropes holding T.J. and Virg.

               Then a HAIL OF BULLETS sprays through the room.

               All three guys hit the deck but T.J. gets shot. He clutches 
               his side, BLOOD all over his hands.

                                     T.J.
                         I'm hit! I'm hit!

                                     VIRG
                         They're shooting for real! This is 
                         all real.

               Xander knows this is true.

                                     XANDER
                         Aw shit.

               He checks out T.J.'s wound.

                                     XANDER
                         Help me with this guy.

                                     VIRG
                         It's like you said, every man for 
                         himself.

               Virg bolts for the door.

                                     XANDER
                         That only works if you're a man!

               EXT. DRUG FARM - NIGHT

               Narcos are shouting, running to and fro.

               TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air. They are trying to repel 
               an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE.

               Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like 
               Apocalypse Now, their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place.

               Xander comes out of the torture building holding T.J. in a 
               fireman's carry. His hands are still CUFFED, the length of 
               chain dragging.

               Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting T.J. on the 
               ground.

                                     XANDER
                         You alright?

                                     T.J.
                         I used to be a SEAL, it's not the 
                         first time I've been shot. Thanks, 
                         man.

                                     XANDER
                         Keep your head down, I'll be right 
                         back. I'm gonna steal us some wheels.

               Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting.

               He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY.

               Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way.

               He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters.

               He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night 
               Sun.

               Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the 
               camouflage netting.

                                     VIRG
                         They're all over the place! What the 
                         hell's going on?

                                     XANDER
                         Looks like we're in the middle of 
                         the drug war.

               The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting.

               They're pinned down.

                                     XANDER
                         Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go 
                         that way, I'm gonna go this way. 
                         They can't follow us both.

               They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking 
               up DUST all around them.

                                     XANDER
                         Go!

               They jet off in opposite directions.

               Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands 
               and the dangling chain make it difficult.

               He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS.

               Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.

                                     XANDER
                         Shit!

               The CHOPPER swoops down after him.

               Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him.

               BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground 
               right behind him.

               Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in 
               "North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's 
               running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.

               Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him.

               Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the 
               plants.

               All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE.

               Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with 
               their guns. Narcos run terrified.

               Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front 
               of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm gonna need to hit the trees after 
                         a night like this.

               He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT 
               FOREST.

               Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS 
               OF COCAINE. He heads for it.

               Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings 
               around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around 
               him.

               Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck.

               Bullets chew up the dirt all around him.

               As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK.

               There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up.

               WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts 
               into the night air.

               Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into 
               FILTHY WATER.

               A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white.

               Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls 
               inside.

               The Chopper makes another pass overhead.

               The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on.

               Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe.

               JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN 
               flood the compound. There's no going back.

               Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line.

               The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are 
               quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea.

               As he goes by, one of the TREES moves.

               He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on 
               EXPLODES UPWARDS. ARMS reach out, tackling Xander from behind.

               Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds, 
               the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape.

               They fall on him like a curtain.

               XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD 
               is pulled over his head.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY

               As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking 
               off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos 
               onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be 
               seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE.

               The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD.

               We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away.

               Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his 
               head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier 
               smirks as he walks away.

               Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some 
               STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR 
               LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB.

                                     XANDER
                         Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it 
                         Saturday already?

               The Black Ops guys grin knowingly.

               On the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a 
               GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Congratulations, you've just graduated 
                         at the head of your class.

                                     XANDER
                         You're a cold piece of work. You 
                         almost got three people killed out 
                         there.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Good thing you were there to save 
                         the day. Come walk with me.

               Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the

                                     GIBBONS
                         You've really got me confused, Cage. 
                         On the one hand you showed leadership, 
                         courage under fire, a willingness to 
                         protect men you hardly knew... and 
                         on the other you have an arrest record 
                         that pegs you as near sociopathic. 
                         Help me out here. I'm not following 
                         your evolution.

                                     XANDER
                         You want the cheap backstory? The 
                         runaway mom, the suicide dad and the 
                         foster homes? Gimme a break. You're 
                         not interested in my past, you're 
                         interested in my future as some kind 
                         of spy.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You're perceptive too. I forgot to 
                         add that to the list of surprises. 
                         I'm with the National Security Agency. 
                         And unlikely as it may sound, I need 
                         your help.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm not interested. I've already got 
                         a job.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You're an adrenaline junkie with one 
                         foot in the penitentiary. You risk 
                         your ass building a daredevil myth 
                         that means nothing and you're not 
                         getting any younger.

                                     XANDER
                         I plan on getting a lot older. And 
                         playing spy games sounds like a quick 
                         way to get yourself dead.

                                     GIBBONS
                         That's too bad. I thought a guy like 
                         you would appreciate the challenge.

               As they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're 
               getting busy. One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH. Another 
               plugs in a BONE SAW.

                                     XANDER
                         What's this? You're gonna try to 
                         scare me now?

               Gibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Do you know the reason why I try to 
                         recruit guys like you? There's no 
                         risk.

               He tosses it into the tub. Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and 
               BUBBLE. The tub is full of ACID.

                                     GIBBONS
                         There's nobody back home who's gonna 
                         ask questions if you just... disappear 
                         for a while.

               In seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a 
               oily cloud of residue.

               Gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home.

                                     XANDER
                         Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So 
                         what's the deal? What do you need me 
                         for?

                                     GIBBONS
                         There's some folks I want to keep 
                         tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. 
                         Your kind of people.

                                     XANDER
                         What do I get out of it?

                                     GIBBONS
                         If you find out what I want to know, 
                         and if I'm able to successfully use 
                         that information, you get to go back 
                         to your degenerate little life. If 
                         not, you take a bath.

                                     XANDER
                         You're one sick bastard. A sadist 
                         with a badge looking to rope me in 
                         to a suicide mission. I think no 
                         matter which way I go I'm likely to 
                         wind up face down on a sheet of 
                         plastic. So here's my answer: kiss 
                         my ass, Hop-along.

               Gibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his 
               ass. Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming.

               The Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a 
               fight.

                                     XANDER
                         Not bad for a gimp.

                                     GIBBONS
                         What's with that "X" on the back of 
                         your head? Does that mean you're 
                         "extreme"? I've got some news for 
                         you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. 
                         So maybe you should tattoo another 
                         couple of X's on your head.

               Xander gets up.

                                     XANDER
                         I'll take that under advisement. 
                         Maybe I can be like you and lose a 
                         leg for the old Stars and Bars. I 
                         bet the flag's a great comfort every 
                         time you need help climbing stairs.

               Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like 
               grip of his thumb and middle finger.

                                     GIBBONS
                         One twitch and my finger and thumb 
                         will meet inside your esophagus. 
                         Believe me, Mr. X, I've put foot to 
                         ass for my country on many occasions 
                         and I don't feel the urge to stop 
                         just yet. So think carefully before 
                         you tell me: Is "kiss my ass, Hop-
                         along" your final answer?

               The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed. He 
               looks over, sees the bone saw start revving.

                                     XANDER
                              (choking)
                         No.

               Gibbons releases his grip.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I thought you might see it my way.

               Then Xander starts walking away.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Where you going, X? I said where you 
                         going?

               The Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him.

                                     XANDER
                         You tell me.

               Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream.

                                     XANDER
                         There better be a movie on this Goddam 
                         flight.

               INT. GULFSTREAM - DAY

               Xander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs. They are 
               surrounded by NSA AGENTS in suits.

               A NERDY AGENT snaps an ANKLET around Xander's ankle.

                                     XANDER
                         How about a pedicure as long as you're 
                         down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Wherever you go on the planet, I'll 
                         find you. There's no quitting. If 
                         you try to take it off, a ring of 
                         needles will inject enough curare 
                         into your bloodstream to kill you 
                         before you hit the ground. Is all 
                         that clear?

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, I spy or I die.

               INT. EMPTY FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - SUNSET

               Orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge. There's a 
               fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused. That's because 
               it's been sealed off for NSA use. (NOTE: perfect product 
               placement opportunity for an AIRLINE).

               Xander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the 
               smoked glass windows.

               The Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized ELECTRONIC 
               DEVICE.

                                     NERDY AGENT
                         This is your communicator. You'll 
                         identify yourself by a call sign. 
                         From here on out you're Bulldog Omega 
                         5.

                                     XANDER
                         You must stay up late to come up 
                         with shit like that.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I expect you to call in regularly 
                         with progress reports.

                                     XANDER
                         Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog 
                         Omega 5.

               Gibbons checks his watch. They get up and start walking.

               INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SUNSET

               The phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they 
               walk to the gate. The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up.

                                     AGENT
                         Uh... Call signs derive from the 
                         parameters of the mission.

                                     GIBBONS
                         If he doesn't like it, we can make 
                         an exception just this once. We'll 
                         call him "Triple X".

               They walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents FLASH 
               BADGES to the GATE WORKERS.

                                     XANDER
                         Up yours.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Crude and defiant as always, Triple 
                         X. It fits so well because you're 
                         obscene.

               Xander is the last one to board the plane.

                                     XANDER
                         Is that all?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Just remember, I'll be watching.

               As the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx 
               of Agents.

                                     XANDER
                         I've got something for you to chew 
                         on. Next time you send someone to 
                         save the world, make sure they like 
                         the planet the way it is.

               The jet's door CLOSES.

               INT. COMMERCIAL JET - NIGHT

               Xander is in the last row against the bulkhead. He's got a 
               personal DVD player and headphones and he's reviewing his 
               mission. The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool 
               graphics.

               The KID sitting across the aisle leans over for a look.

                                     KID
                         What game is that?

                                     XANDER
                         Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? 
                         They're called "Anarchy 99", they're 
                         the bad guy bosses.

                                     KID
                         Do they have any special powers? The 
                         bosses always have special powers.

                                     XANDER
                         You wanna check it out? Come here.

               The kid moves to the seat next to Xander.

               Onscreen see photos of the FIVE BAD GUYS from the opening 
               sequence. We DIVE IN to the computer as Xander describes 
               them.

               For each of the baddies, we'll see 3-D PHOTOS and VIDEO CLIPS, 
               all enhanced with COMPUTER GRAPHICS and POP-UP MENUS.

                                     XANDER
                         First we've got Anders, the psycho 
                         looking biker. In charge of 
                         transportation and smuggling. Controls 
                         every trucking union in Eastern 
                         Europe. Don't look too clean, either.

               We see ANDERS, the wild-eyed and unclean Swedish biker, 
               against a backdrop of MOTORCYCLES and MUSCLE CARS.

                                     XANDER
                         Next we got a Siberian redneck, 
                         Viktor. Into snowmobiles and 
                         snowboarding. So naturally, he covers 
                         prostitution and the drug trade.

                                     KID
                         Naturally.

               We see Viktor, with the goatee and belly, doing some hairy 
               snowboarding.

                                     KID
                         This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.

                                     XANDER
                         Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a 
                         bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed 
                         kills in Chechnya, they called him 
                         the "Finger of God". Assassination 
                         and weapons.

               We see Kirill in UNIFORM with his well used SNIPER RIFLE.

                                     KID
                         Who's the hottie?

               He indicates Petra, the tough gangster chick. With her LEATHER 
               and TATTOOS she looks like she could mop up the floor with 
               Lara Croft.

                                     XANDER
                         You like her, huh? Petra. She runs 
                         their finances, money laundering, 
                         computers. Joined the gang after 
                         spending some time as the girlfriend 
                         of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin. Capo 
                         of Anarchy 99.

               Finally we see YORGI, the unlikely looking Mafiya Don. We 
               see CRIME SCENE PHOTOS that illustrate his exploits.

                                     XANDER
                         Yorgi masterminded the take-over of 
                         three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called 
                         it "blood week". He combined all of 
                         their global enterprises into one 
                         huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.

                                     KID
                              (skeptically)
                         "Anarchy" 99"?

                                     XANDER
                         What are you gonna do? They're Euro-
                         trash.

                                     KID
                         What weapons do you have?

               Xander clicks on "INVENTORY". He scrolls through a staggering 
               array of WEAPONS and VEHICLES.

                                     XANDER
                         Just about anything I want, it looks 
                         like. This is gonna be tough, though. 
                         There's no way to save this game. I 
                         gotta get it right the first time 
                         through.

                                     KID
                         What do you get if you finish?

                                     XANDER
                         Nothing, really. My guy is just doing 
                         it to stay alive.

                                     KID
                         Oh. I bet by the end he gets something 
                         out of it.

                                     XANDER
                         Like what?

                                     KID
                         He gets to be the hero.

               The Kid's mom calls him back to his seat. Xander looks at 
               the kid, then gets back to his research.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PRAGUE - DAY

               We CRANE UP from the COBBLESTONE STREET as a BEAT-UP CAR 
               races by. We rise up, revealing PRAGUE in all it's glory.

               INT. BEAT-UP CAR - MOVING

               Xander sits in the back, wedged between TWO IDENTICAL LOOKING 
               TOUGH GUYS. If you were to call Central Casting and ask for 
               a couple of cold war spy types, this is what they'd send.

               They're both 6' 4", have sloppily cut hair, square jaws, 
               wrinkled overcoats.

                                     XANDER
                         This is bullshit, man, I wanna see 
                         some ID.

               The two tough guys flash their COP ID's. Xander studies them. 
               "IVAN PEDGRAG" and "IVAN PODROV".

                                     XANDER
                         You're both named Ivan? That's gotta 
                         be confusing on Valentine's Day. So 
                         where we headed? Fellas, I said where 
                         we headed?
                              (beat)
                         Yeah, whatever.

               He looks out the window, sees a GRAND HOTEL. They drive right 
               on by.

               EXT. DIRTY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               It's a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town. Xander 
               shakes his head.

                                     XANDER
                         James Bond never had to put up with 
                         this shit.

               Ivan 1 pulls Xander's gear bag from the trunk and throws it 
               on the sidewalk.

               Xander picks it up and carries it into the building.

               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Dumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows. Xander is ushered 
               in. There's another GUY in a UGLY SUIT waiting. He is 
               DETECTIVE MILAN SLOVO.

                                     SLOVO
                         Sit down.

                                     XANDER
                         I've been on a plane for twelve hours, 
                         I think I'll stand.

               Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair.

                                     SLOVO
                         My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. 
                         When you are here you are under my 
                         jurisdiction, you take my orders, 
                         you do what I say. If you become any 
                         kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot 
                         you.

                                     XANDER
                         Here we go again.

                                     SLOVO
                         You're here because your government 
                         is putting pressure on my government. 
                         This is an internal affair, a Czech 
                         affair, that you are interfering 
                         with. I will warn you once: Don't 
                         shit in my lawn. Get whatever 
                         information your government seeks 
                         and get our.

                                     XANDER
                         First of all, you should kill whoever 
                         sold you that suit. Two, I don't 
                         wanna be here either, so just step 
                         off. Three, if you had the authority 
                         to shoot me you would've done it by 
                         now, so just ease up on the machismo, 
                         bitch. Now that we've got that sorted 
                         out, I'm gonna get some rest.

               Xander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with 
               hatred. He heads to the door.

                                     SLOVO
                         Be ready in three hours.

               Slovo exits. Ivans 1 & 2 stay, staring at Xander.

               EXT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT

               A fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big 
               bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass, 
               expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous.

               Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a 
               Tshirt that says "RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND" complete with 
               a photo of the Hedgehog.

               INT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT

               A STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the 
               stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco 
               is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE. All the 
               STRIPPERS are outfitted in HELMETS, ELBOW PADS, G-STRINGS 
               and BELLY SHIRTS.

               There's a WARPED TOUR BAND playing on a STAGE. On either 
               side of the stage are two MINI-HALF PIPES that the GIRLS are 
               cutting back and forth on.

               WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN sit in plush booths getting table dances 
               while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed YOUNG 
               HIPSTERS.

               Xander gets a beer from a BUXOM COCKTAIL WAITRESS on IN-LINE 
               SKATES.

                                     XANDER
                         Nice hops.

                                     SLOVO
                         The corner. Anarchy 99.

               Slovo points them out in the far corner. They're surrounded 
               by straight faced BODYGUARDS.

               What ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS 
               looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times... 
               These guys are living like rock stars.

               They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the 
               middle sit Yorgi and Petra. Petra's wearing an "I AM EVIL" 
               Tshirt.

                                     SLOVO
                         See the one with the funny colored 
                         hair? Crazy bitch stabbed one of my 
                         men in the knee-cap. There they are, 
                         American. The low-rent millionaire 
                         criminals. And you thought only your 
                         country had white trash. American?

               He looks around but Xander is gone. He heads for the exit, 
               pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him, 
               not by the door but deeper in the club.

                                     SLOVO
                         Oh no!

               He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and 
               start talking to them.

                                     SLOVO
                         Jesus Christ!

               Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested 
               in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing 
               at him and waving him over.

                                     SLOVO
                              (horrified)
                         What the hell...?

               Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth. Yorgi 
               looks him up and down.

                                     XANDER
                         That's the guy.

                                     YORGI
                         This pizda? Never seen him before.

                                     XANDER
                              (to Slovo)
                         Who you workin' for? What do you do 
                         for a living, dickhead?

                                     SLOVO
                         Uh... I am... I work in insurance.

               Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him.

                                     SLOVO
                              (panicked whisper)
                         What the hell are you doing?

               He slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's 
               police badge.

                                     XANDER
                         Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on 
                         the mack.

               The Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the 
               emergency exit in a panic. In seconds he's out and gone.

                                     YORGI
                         Cops. Like a plague. No matter how 
                         many you pay there's always another 
                         with his hand out. How did you pick 
                         him out?

                                     XANDER
                         He flashed his badge to half the bar 
                         when he bought his drink.

                                     YORGI
                         I appreciate you bringing this to 
                         our attention. Whatever you want, 
                         the rest of the night, consider it 
                         on the house.

               Yorgi waves over some strippers.

                                     XANDER
                         Thanks, but I'm here on business. I 
                         heard you're the G around here. I'm 
                         looking for some cars, expensive 
                         ones. A lot of them.

                                     YORGI
                         Sorry, man, don't know what you're 
                         talking about.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm talking about the sports cars 
                         that disappear off the docks in Genoa 
                         and wind up here. If you don't know 
                         about 'em, who does?

               Yorgi nods and the Bodyguards step in front of Xander.

                                     XANDER
                         I guess I heard wrong.

               Xander turns to leave.

               That's when Anders notices the "X" tattoo on the back of 
               Xander's head. He gets excited and alerts Yorgi.

                                     YORGI
                         Xander Cage!

               Xander turns. Suddenly their whole demeanor changes. All 
               five guys get up, awed, and push the Bodyguards out of the 
               way.

                                     ANDERS
                         The X man! We seen your bootleg 
                         videos!

                                     VIKTOR
                         You sick! You sick crazy on a board, 
                         on a bike! Everything!

                                     YORGI
                         This is insane, man. Xander Cage in 
                         Prague. Come on, sit. Sit with us.

               Yorgi signals for more drinks.

                                     YORGI
                         I remember that one where you jump 
                         the motorcycle over the freeway at 
                         rush hour.

                                     XANDER
                         When else are you gonna do it?

                                     VIKTOR
                         You almost died on that one.

                                     XANDER
                         Cops arrested me while I was still 
                         in surgery. Did two months.

                                     YORGI
                         We seen all your shit! So you want 
                         cars? We get whatever cars you need. 
                         What are you looking for?

                                     XANDER
                         Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end 
                         pasta rockets. Ten to start.

                                     ANDERS
                         Ten! No problem! We do that no 
                         problem!

               Petra elbows Anders.

                                     PETRA
                         Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're 
                         talking a lousy million five U.S.

                                     XANDER
                         I have Japanese buyers who are looking 
                         to move a fleet, if you have the 
                         quality of merchandise they're after. 
                         And it's a mil two, max.

               Petra glances at Yorgi who nods.

                                     PETRA
                         Do you know what a wire transfer is?

                                     XANDER
                         Is she for real? Honey, maybe you 
                         should quiet down and let the grownups 
                         have a conversation.

                                     PETRA
                         My goodness, a word with four 
                         syllables. I should get some ice 
                         before your brain gets too hot.

                                     XANDER
                         Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.

                                     PETRA
                              (smiles)
                         So cute. He shows up for a battle of 
                         wits with a mental butter knife.

               Xander looks to Yorgi.

                                     YORGI
                              (laughing)
                         Don't look at me, X, she handles all 
                         the details.

                                     XANDER
                         It'll work faster if I have an account 
                         number.

               Petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin.

                                     PETRA
                         You'll have forty-eight hours to 
                         complete the transfer. Don't waste 
                         our time.

               Xander snatches the napkin.

                                     XANDER
                         Wouldn't dream of it. I'm even gonna 
                         throw in a few extra bucks to send 
                         you to charm school.

               Petra glares at him.

                                     YORGI
                         Alright, now that business is 
                         finished, we party! Bitches, come! 
                         We have a drink and toast the deal!

               Yorgi claps and a flock of strippers descends on the booth.

               Anarchy 99 lifts their glasses. Xander joins in the toast.

                                     XANDER
                         I believe I can hang with you fellas 
                         for a while.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING

               We see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway.

               INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING

               Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him, 
               waving a COMMUNIQUÉ.

               Gibbons grabs the communiqué, reads it. He looks up, stunned.

               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator 
               RINGS.

                                     XANDER
                              (into phone)
                         I guess you got my E-mail. I set up 
                         a purchase. Ten cars.

               INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM

                         If you're trying to push my buttons, 
                         you're on the right track. Don't 
                         make me question my own judgment, X.

                         Buddy, you sent me here to get close 
                         to their organization, that costs 
                         money.

                                     GIBBONS
                         One point two million dollars? I did 
                         not authorize you to spend one point 
                         two million dollars!

                                     XANDER
                         I'm already on a first name basis 
                         with these dudes, I got a deal set 
                         up, you want me to hammer it or not?

                                     GIBBONS
                         We're not after car thieves here.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell am I after? You're 
                         telling me dick.

                                     GIBBONS
                         That information is classified. You're 
                         there to gather information on their 
                         operations, period.

                                     XANDER
                         Call me crazy, but I thought hooking 
                         up a million dollar deal was a great 
                         way to get on their good side. What 
                         else? You gonna hassle me about the 
                         weapons and spy stuff too?

                                     GIBBONS
                         My friend, if you're planning on 
                         crossing me...

                                     XANDER
                         I know, poison needles in my shins. 
                         You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.

               Xander hangs up.

               INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY

               Gibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the 
               communiqué.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry 
                         Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this 
                         time.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I think we should send him whatever 
                         he wants.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         You what? A wire transfer of this 
                         size?

                                     GIBBONS
                         If it means getting Silent Night 
                         back, absolutely.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         You're talking about a very expensive 
                         risk here.

                                     GIBBONS
                         He's gotten closer in 24 hours than 
                         all of the other operatives combined. 
                         He got us an account number to boot. 
                         Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, 
                         I say we back his play.
                              (beat)
                         I put him out there, Sam. If he 
                         doesn't come up with the money, 
                         they'll kill him. I can't let that 
                         happen.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Why not? You were going to throw him 
                         in a tub full of acid, weren't you?

               Gibbons smiles.

                                     SAM TANNICK
                         Alright, do what you want. But keep 
                         the screws on him. He's a wild card. 
                         That could be either good or bad.

                                     GIBBONS
                         So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I 
                         can deal with that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY

               A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut. 
               He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is 
               TOBY LEE SHAVERS.

               Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL 
               CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle.

                                     SLOVO
                         Your government must know something 
                         we don't.

               Shavers walks up to them.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle-
                         trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent 
                         Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking 
                         for what's his name. Three X' s.

                                     XANDER
                         That's would be me.

               Shavers gives him a disapproving look.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Figures. You got someplace we can 
                         spread out my gear or what? I mean 
                         today.

               Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off, 
               muttering to himself.

                                     SLOVO
                         I'll leave you two alone to talk.

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, thanks a lot.

               INT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - BASEMENT TRAINING AREA - DAY

               Down in the basement there is a SHOOTING RANGE along one 
               wall. A squad of CZECH COPS is BLASTING AWAY. They become 
               distracted by the noise in the middle of the room.

               One of the metal boxes has been dropped by a Cop. The rest 
               are spread out in front of Xander, Slovo and Shavers.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Back off, just go away you klutz. 
                         Alright, here's the story. The items 
                         in these cases belong to me. I 
                         designed them, built them, and was 
                         going to use them in the field myself 
                         until you showed up.

                                     XANDER
                         I stole your beat, huh? Guess you 
                         forgot to brown-nose the right people.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Is that supposed to be funny? I'm 
                         not laughing. I've worked for ten 
                         years to get my shot at being a field 
                         agent, funny boy. And ar the last 
                         minute I get bumped by you, some 
                         reject from the Ozzfest.

                                     XANDER
                         Why don't you show me some gear before 
                         you get hurt.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Listen to you. Right away, sir, 
                         anything you say, sir.

               Shavers pops open the first metal case. Inside are various 
               GADGETS laid into the molded carbon fiber lining.

                                     XANDER
                         What is all this? I didn't even order 
                         some of this stuff.

               Shavers holds up a small METAL BALL.

                                     SHAVERS
                         You're gonna need it, rookie, trust 
                         me.

               The metal ball unrolls into a six legged ROBOT INSECT.

                                     SHAVERS
                         An all-terrain mobile video monitoring 
                         system for surveillance. I call it 
                         the "Roach Cam". See the little camera 
                         it's got for a head?

               Xander picks it up.

                                     XANDER
                         Kinda looks like you.

               Shavers snatches it back. He puts on a METAL GLOVE, it's 
               fingers are SHARP TALONS.

                                     SHAVERS
                         "Terminator" climbing claws.

               He CLAMPS the claw onto the metal case. It holds fast.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Miniature power cams set in on 
                         contact, giving you a sure grip on 
                         any surface.

                                     XANDER
                         They come in any other styles or 
                         colors?

               He tosses the glove aside, pulls out a DART GUN.

                                     SHAVERS
                         This is your standard dart gun.

                                     XANDER
                         That one I'm real familiar with.

               Shavers displays a case of DARTS.

                                     SHAVERS
                         You've got your chromium knock-out 
                         dart, microphone listening dart, 
                         explosive dart, even one with a 
                         splatter blood packet, whatever you 
                         need. They also come in a special 
                         9mm casing for use with your service 
                         pistol.

               Xander pulls out some SUPER BINOCULARS.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Multi-view binoculars. Nine different 
                         enhanced vision modes, plus a digital 
                         camera.

               Xander looks through them, starts cycling through the 
               different modes.

               BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see the various modes as Xander scans 
               the grounds.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Infrared, starlight... Even a special 
                         "penetrator" mode to see through 
                         walls, curtains, almost anything...

               Xander aims at the shooting range.

               BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see through the clothes of the FEMALE 
               COPS on the shooting range. (PG-13 style, of course). We can 
               even see the INNER WORKINGS of their GUNS. One of the Female 
               Cops turns and gives Xander an approving look.

                                     XANDER
                         I think I'll hang on to these.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Think again, that's government 
                         property. You have to sign for 
                         everything. I've got one more that 
                         wasn't on your list.

               Shavers pulls out a JUMPSUIT.

                                     XANDER
                         From the Beastie Boys collection?

                                     SHAVERS
                         It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, 
                         water, recording gear, anything you 
                         need for covert spying. It's all-
                         weather, fire retardant, and if you 
                         give this buckle a sharp pull, the 
                         whole outfit deploys into a parachute.

                                     XANDER
                         You're joking, right?

               Shavers just gives him a deadpan look.

                                     SHAVERS
                         Now that I've given you the overview, 
                         we're going to spend the next couple 
                         hours going into extensive operational 
                         detail.

                                     XANDER
                         I thought that was in detail.

               As Shavers drones on, Xander hangs his head.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY

               The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two 
               TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch.

               The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander 
               supervises. Anders hovers around him.

                                     ANDERS
                         So what you think? Beautiful!

               Sitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra.

               Petra has a LAPTOP.

                                     YORGI
                         Has it arrived yet?

               Petra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their 
               BANK ACCOUNT.

                                     PETRA
                         Nothing. He had two days.

                                     YORGI
                         Perhaps he is not all he says he is.

               Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office. 
               Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL.

               Xander opens the door.

                                     XANDER
                         Very nice. I'm impressed.

                                     YORGI
                         I'm somewhat less so. We seem to 
                         have a bit of a problem...

               Just then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into 
               their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles.

                                     XANDER
                         I had to inspect the merchandise 
                         first.

                                     YORGI
                         Of course.

               He nods for Kirill to stand down.

               OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the 
               Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER.

                                     XANDER
                         What's this?

                                     YORGI
                         This is a gift. From me to you.

               Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC 
               GTO.

                                     YORGI
                         It's a little nothing, you take it.

               Xander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger 
               seat.

                                     YORGI
                         Come on, get in.

               Xander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine 
               ROARS.

                                     XANDER
                         You're alright, Yorgi.

               Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on 
               the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's 
               got a camera with a big zoom lens.

                                     SLOVO
                         Smile, bychara.

               Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get 
               a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the 
               roof.

               CRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE.

               Down below, Kirill hears the noise.

                                     KIRILL
                         Yorgi!

               They all look to the abandoned building.

               Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg 
               poking through the ceiling.

               Xander is taken aback.

                                     YORGI
                         What in the hell...?

               Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol.

               Thinking fast, Xander does the same.

               They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's 
               heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw 
               as well, all of them covering Xander.

                                     YORGI
                         What's going on, my friend?

                                     XANDER
                         You tell me! You got a sniper up 
                         there or what?

                                     YORGI
                         He's not with us, Xander. He must be 
                         with you.

                                     XANDER
                              (he cocks the hammer)
                         Bullshit! You get your boy off that 
                         roof or I swear to God I'm gonna 
                         give you another hole to breathe out 
                         of.

               Yorgi stares, finally believes him. He lowers his gun.

                                     YORGI
                         Get him! Find out who he is!

               By now Slovo is down the fire escape. He hits the ground and 
               goes running down the street.

               The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars. Xander SPINS the 
               cylinder on his REVOLVER.

                                     XANDER
                         I've got him. Buckle up.

               The GTO peels out.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander 
               comes skidding around the corner. He looks back and sees the 
               speeding GTO.

                                     YORGI
                         That's the cop from the club!

               Xander does the only thing he can. He puts the car sideways 
               and aims out the window as he slides to a stop.

               Slovo turns and BLAM! Xander SHOOTS Slovo right in the chest.

               IN SLO-MO: a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest and Slovo 
               falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and 
               betrayal.

               The smoking shell clatters to the ground.

               Slovo blinks up at Xander, gasping for words, then lays still.

               Xander hops out, rifles through Slovo's pockets. The other 
               Anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on.

                                     YORGI
                         What are you doing? Get in the car!

               Xander heads back to the GTO and the cars peel out.

               INT. GTO - MOVING - DAY

               The rest of Anarchy 99 follows behind the GTO.

                                     YORGI
                         I don't believe it! You can't shoot 
                         a cop in the middle of the street!

                                     XANDER
                              (grim)
                         Had to do what I had to do.

               He pulls out the roll of FILM. Yorgi laughs.

                                     YORGI
                         You say you get a million, you get 
                         the million. Some cop gives us shit, 
                         he's dead. Jesus Christ, man, you're 
                         hard-core!

               EXT. DEAD END STREET - DAY

               The Ivans pull up in their transport trucks. They see all 
               the blood and rush towards Slovo. But something doesn't look 
               right.

               Ivan 1 TASTES the blood and spits it out.

                                     IVAN 1
                         It's sweet.

               Ivan 2 pulls a CHROME DART from Slovo's chest. Slovo GROANS.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               It's a crowded basement rave club. Hot and sweaty RAVERS 
               dance in provocative outfits. The Anarchy 99 group is standing 
               on the best booth, right on the packed dance floor.

               Surrounding them are a handful of MAFIYA BODYGUARDS who stand 
               at attention like the Secret Service.

               Anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table, 
               smashing glass.

               A DRUNK GUY tries to pull Petra onto the dance floor and she 
               PUNCHES him. The Bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper 
               thrashing. Yorgi shatters a BOTTLE against the wall.

                                     YORGI
                         Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 
                         99!

                                     XANDER
                         What's "Anarchy 99"?

                                     YORGI
                         It's all this craziness! It's what 
                         we've been living since 99, when we 
                         left the Army. One of our brothers 
                         died in Grozny and we said the hell 
                         with this shit. What for? He dies 
                         for what? Politics? Who's politics? 
                         Not ours.

                                     XANDER
                         You wanna see my politics?

               Xander shows him a TATTOO on his arm. It shows PLANET EARTH 
               with a giant SCREW through it.

                                     XANDER
                         Screw the world. If I'm gonna die 
                         for something, it better be bitches 
                         and money.

                                     YORGI
                         That's what I'm talking about, man! 
                         That's why Anarchy 99 was born.

               Yorgi rolls up his sleeve, revealing an Anarchy 99 tat (a 
               circled "A" with "99" underneath).

                                     YORGI
                         To us it means no walls, no speed 
                         limits, no jails. It's everybody 
                         does what he wants. People think 
                         democracy is freedom but they don't 
                         have a clue. There's an old punk 
                         song. It says: "America stands for 
                         freedom, but if you think you're 
                         free..."

                                     XANDER
                         "...try walking into a deli and 
                         urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy 
                         Burger' by the Vandals.

                                     YORGI
                         You got it, man. It's stupid but 
                         it's true. True freedom is when you 
                         do whatever you want anytime you 
                         want. That's when you know you're 
                         living, man.

                                     XANDER
                         How you gonna do that with government 
                         and rules everywhere?

                                     YORGI
                         Easy. You get enough money that you 
                         grow an ass big enough for the whole 
                         world to kiss.

               Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The 
               Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti.

                                     YORGI
                         You hang with us, buddy, taste some 
                         freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy!

               Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone 
               with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander 
               joins her, but she won't even look at him.

                                     XANDER
                         This is great, dancing with the back 
                         of your head.

               She reluctantly turns around.

                                     XANDER
                         If you got a problem with me, why 
                         are we dancing?

                                     PETRA
                         Yorgi asked me to.

                                     XANDER
                         You do everything Yorgi says?

                                     PETRA
                         Go to hell.

                                     XANDER
                         It's gonna be like that, huh? You 
                         got all bent out of shape as soon as 
                         he started dancing with someone else. 
                         Why's that?

                                     PETRA
                         Mind your business.

                                     XANDER
                         Did you guys used to date? That's 
                         it, right? He broke your heart and 
                         you're still soft on him. That's 
                         funny, it don't seem to fit with a 
                         tough broad like you.

               She glares at him and walks away. Xander follows.

                                     XANDER
                         Where are you going?

                                     PETRA
                         Why are you still hanging around? 
                         Your business is finished, you should 
                         go home.

                                     XANDER
                         I was invited. What's your story?

                                     PETRA
                         I don't know who you are or where 
                         you come from, but I don't like you. 
                         You ask too many questions.

               There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the 
               "men's". Petra heads into the Men's Room.

               Some DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and 
               enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink.

                                     XANDER
                         Come on, don't front like that. You'll 
                         put a guy right off you.

                                     PETRA
                         Don't even bother, X man, I'm not 
                         your type.

                                     XANDER
                         That right? Why's that?

               The stall door flies open and Petra marches out.

                                     PETRA
                         My chest is too small and my brain 
                         is too big.

               She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall.

               Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing.

               Across the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and 
               puts on "ANARCHY BURGER" by the Vandals. The rave dance is 
               interrupted by the pounding punk beat.

                                     YORGI
                         Xander, check it out! The revolution 
                         begins!

               Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent 
               mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys.

                                     YORGI
                         Let's get some air, man.

               Yorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries 
               out another door.

               EXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

               It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river.

                                     XANDER
                         You got a great set-up here Yorgi. 
                         You really know how to live.

                                     YORGI
                         It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's 
                         been good to me.

                                     XANDER
                         I've been here before, when I was a 
                         kid. My old man was in the service, 
                         we used to live on the Army base in 
                         Hamburg.

                                     YORGI
                         You, an Army brat? I don't see that 
                         one at all. Did you join the service 
                         as well?

                                     XANDER
                         Hell no. My dad was a straight up 
                         tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this 
                         general off and got himself 
                         dishonorably discharged. Had a court 
                         martial and everything. The charges 
                         were total bullshit, so he was sure 
                         he'd get his name cleared, but it 
                         didn't happen.

                                     YORGI
                         Connections and politics, it's the 
                         same everywhere.

                                     XANDER
                         My old man, he bought into the system, 
                         and it screwed him. So he swallowed 
                         a bullet. Me, I don't believe in 
                         nothing I can't see and touch.

               The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets 
               and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a 
               window with his SNIPER RIFLE.

               P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs.

               The scope pans over to Yorgi, who looks INTO CAMERA and gives 
               a small signal, calling off the hit.

               BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER

               Yorgi looks up at a "PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE" banner.

                                     YORGI
                         Next week these idiots are having a 
                         peace conference here. What the hell 
                         are they going to talk about? It's 
                         the system itself that causes all 
                         the world's problems. You're okay, 
                         buddy. Come on, it's getting early.

               They stroll off and Kirill stands down.

               EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - SUNRISE

               A flotilla of VEHICLES (Xander's GTO among them) drives 
               through the gate in a massive, stone wall. It's a big manor 
               house in the middle of town.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - PRAGUE - SUNRISE

               The GTO, sedans, SUV's park in the courtyard. Xander sees a 
               row of MOTORCYCLES parked here as well.

               Xander also sees a Guard hit a switch that LOWERS the HEAVY 
               WOODEN GATE.

               Yorgi corrals a bunch of STRIPPERS he's brought home.

                                     YORGI
                         This way, girls, let's go!

               He leads the whole troop inside.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - SUNRISE

               As they go down the hall/Xander sees ROOMS FULL OF OFFICE 
               WORKERS and MAFIYA GOONS.

                                     VIKTOR
                         Diversified global operations. The 
                         sun never sets on our empire.

               Xander takes in WORLD MAPS, FAX MACHINES, BANKS OF COMPUTERS.

               For all their screwing around, it's clear Anarchy 99 runs a 
               large operation.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - SUNRISE

               With leaded glass windows overlooking the river, this place 
               is beautiful. Inside it's done up more like the house from 
               MTV's "Real World", except trashed. There's cool fish tanks, 
               a pool table, PS2 on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes 
               all over the walls.

               SERVANTS welcome them with food and Yorgi's SECRETARY gives 
               him important messages.

                                     YORGI
                              (sorting through 
                              messages)
                         Not bad, yes? The original owners, 
                         they just one day decide to move 
                         out.

               Anders starts pounding on a drumset. Petra kicks a soccer 
               ball at him.

                                     PETRA
                         Yeb vas, z'opa. Shut up!

               Yorgi paws at a Stripper.

                                     YORGI
                         I've got meetings this afternoon, 
                         I've got to get some sleep. Just 
                         pick a girl.

                                     XANDER
                         That's alright, I'm kinda tired.

                                     YORGI
                         You want to insult me? This is my 
                         hospitality. Pick one.

               Xander points at one of the Strippers. She's wearing a 
               fashionable FLAK JACKET.

                                     YORGI
                         Good, now find a room to crash in.

               Petra, show him.

               The surly Petra opens a door, revealing a hall of doors.

               Xander and Flak Jacket follow.

                                     XANDER
                         You gonna tuck us in?

               She just gives him a nasty look, walks into her room and 
               slams the door. Xander scratches his head and picks a room.

               The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - XANDER'S ROOM - SUNRISE

               Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom. Xander talks to 
               her while he gets undressed.

                                     XANDER
                         Listen, no offense, but I'm not in 
                         the market right now, okay? You can 
                         stay here, but let's not --

               He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom. She's wearing 
               just a G-string and the flak jacket.

                                     XANDER
                         You don't understand a word I'm 
                         saying, do you?

               She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off. She 
               looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING still pierced through his nipple 
               and gives a puzzled look.

                                     XANDER
                         Stupid, right? That's what I was 
                         trying to tell you. I just got out 
                         of this heavy thing...

               She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (PG-13 style).

                                     XANDER
                         The things I have to do for my 
                         country.

               He gives in and starts making out with her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING

               Xander sneaks out of his room and down the hail. Behind him, 
               we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - MORNING

               Anders is snoring on the floor. Xander skirrs around him and 
               goes through another door.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY

               Xander finds an office and starts going through the desk. He 
               finds a PALM PILOT and snaps a RECORDING DEVICE to the bottom. 
               In seconds he's copied everything on it. He moves on to some 
               drawers.

                                     PETRA
                         What are you doing?

               He turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a GUN.

                                     XANDER
                         Looking for a phone book. I want to 
                         call a cab. Unless you wanna give me 
                         a ride?

               She shuts the door, advances, staring him down.

                                     PETRA
                         Who are you?

                                     XANDER
                         We hung out last night, remember?

                                     PETRA
                         I also remember you drove your car 
                         here. Who are you really? Make no 
                         mistake, I will shoot you and not 
                         feel bad about it. Who are you working 
                         for?

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude 
                         trying to make a buck.

               She SLAPS him, hard.

                                     PETRA
                         Bullshit. I see you look at 
                         everything, study everything, ask 
                         questions. I know exactly what you're 
                         doing. Empty your pockets.

                                     XANDER
                         You've got to relax, baby, you're 
                         paranoid.

               She SLAPS him again and Xander goes for her gun. Before he 
               can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from 
               nowhere and has it jammed against his neck. He lets go.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, you're good.

                                     PETRA
                         Maybe we should start again, yes? I 
                         know so little about you, except 
                         that you're not what you say you 
                         are.

                                     XANDER
                         That makes two of us then, sweetheart, 
                         because I ain't buying your bullshit 
                         either. You're not like them, I can 
                         see it in your eyes. So you tell me, 
                         who's bullshitting who?

               INT. YORGI'S BEDROOM - DAY

               There are THREE STRIPPERS asleep in bed. Yorgi is sitting at 
               his COMPUTER in his underwear.

               He's hacked in to the CZECH POLICE network.

                                     YORGI
                         Something bothers me about you, Mr. 
                         Xander Cage...

               He looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for.

               He sits up, getting pissed.

                                     YORGI
                         Get Kirill. Now!

               She heads out. Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on 
               his face.

               Kirill enters, still half asleep.

                                     KIRILL
                         What's the problem?

                                     YORGI
                         I'm inside the police mainframe. Do 
                         you see anything?

               Kirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes.

                                     KIRILL
                         What?

                                     YORGI
                         I've searched their E-mail. No funeral 
                         announcement, no obituary, no call-
                         to-arms. Nothing on the news, even. 
                         I swear I saw a cop get shot 
                         yesterday. How come no one is talking 
                         about it?

               Kirill looks back at the screen. Nothing there.

                         I also check the wire transfer. I 
                         follow the money back to it's source, 
                         but there is no source. It comes 
                         from nowhere. First they bring CIA, 
                         then British SAS, now maybe they 
                         plumb the lower depths. Maybe now 
                         they send someone who looks like us. 
                         Maybe someone like our houseguest 
                         Mr. X.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY

               Petra still has the gun on Xander.

                                     PETRA
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     XANDER
                         The eyes don't lie. All this has 
                         gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You 
                         came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and 
                         you stayed because it was fun. Now 
                         you don't like it so much, but you're 
                         in so deep you can't get out anymore. 
                         Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.

                                     PETRA
                         Go to hell!

                                     XANDER
                         Look at you. You're helping run things 
                         now. You're a gangster. I bet that 
                         snuck up on you. You woke up one day 
                         and you were a criminal.

               She pulls back the hammer on her gun.

                                     XANDER
                         It's cool, I feel you. I might even 
                         be able to help. Here, let me show 
                         you something. You wanna see what's 
                         in my pocket, I'll show you.

               He makes a move and she jabs the gun at him. She reaches 
               into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data 
               recorder.

                                     PETRA
                         What are you?

                                     XANDER
                         I'm an information gatherer. You 
                         wanna go somewhere and talk about 
                         it?

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               Yorgi creeps down the hall, Kirill in tow. They both screw 
               SILENCERS onto their PISTOLS.

               They flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to 
               burst into Xander's room.

               One...

               Two...

               THREE! They kick in the door and aim their guns around.

               Flak Jacket sits up, terrified.

               Yorgi and Kirill lower their guns. Viktor stumbles by in his 
               underwear.

                                     YORGI
                         Where is he?

                                     VIKTOR
                         They went to breakfast.

               INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

               This is a beautiful and historic Prague location with WINDOWS 
               and a nice view. It's rather fancy and PACKED with UPSCALE 
               PATRONS. Petra and Xander sit in the middle of the room, 
               sticking out badly in their grungy clothes.

               A WAITER takes their order.

                                     PETRA
                         Perogies, potato pancakes, fried 
                         goose livers, the sausage plate and 
                         a pot of Turkish coffee.

               Xander shakes his head.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm just gonna have a garden salad. 
                         Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side.

               The Waiter takes off. Petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at 
               Xander.

                                     PETRA
                         That's how you eat? It's like a 
                         gerbil.

                                     XANDER
                              (shrugs)
                         I'm from L.A.

                                     PETRA
                         So why don't you tell me something 
                         about who you gather information 
                         for. They obviously have very deep 
                         pockets. Are you from a rival clan?

                                     XANDER
                         Let's just say I'm freelancing and 
                         leave it at that.

                                     PETRA
                         Whoever sent you knew what they were 
                         doing. You and Yorgi are practically 
                         twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims 
                         who make a lot of noise but don't 
                         say much.

                                     XANDER
                         Don't judge a comic book by it's 
                         cover.

                                     PETRA
                         You agree with a lot of what he says, 
                         don't you.

                                     XANDER
                         I know where he's coming from. The 
                         only thing I really don't get is why 
                         he dumped you. Up until I found that 
                         out, I thought his judgment was pretty 
                         sound.

                                     PETRA
                         Don't even start. I'll be honest, I 
                         don't trust you. Bur lets pretend 
                         for a minute that what you say is 
                         true, that I want to leave. What can 
                         you do about it?

                                     XANDER
                         The people I know want facts, the 
                         kinds of things an insider would 
                         know. They're interested in putting 
                         Anarchy 99 out of business.

                                     PETRA
                         All I have to do is risk my life 
                         providing you with these facts.

                                     XANDER
                         We could work together. Then maybe 
                         we could both get the hell out of 
                         here. There's a beach in Bora Bora 
                         with my name on it.

                                     PETRA
                         A beach named X? That I'd like to 
                         see.

                                     XANDER
                         So there you have it. I guess you 
                         just have to ask yourself, how bad 
                         to you want out?

               She thinks on it. Then her cell phone RINGS.

                                     PETRA
                              (into phone)
                         Da!

                                     KIRILL (O.S.)
                              (on phone)
                         Listen very carefully, Petra. We 
                         think Cage may be an American agent, 
                         do you understand what I'm telling 
                         you?

                                     PETRA
                              (into phone)
                         Yes.

                                     KIRILL (O.S.)
                              (on phone)
                         Don't worry, I've got your back. I'm 
                         right across the street, above the 
                         bakery. Just bring him outside and 
                         let me do the rest.

               Kirill hangs up. She looks back at Xander, shell shocked.

                                     XANDER
                         What's up? Is there a problem?

               She studies his eyes, decides to risk it.

                                     PETRA
                         They tell me you're an American agent.

                                     XANDER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PETRA
                         There's no more time for games. They 
                         made you. There's a sniper out front 
                         waiting to put a bullet in your eye. 
                         Tell me if it's true.

                                     XANDER
                         It's a long story, but yeah, more or 
                         less.

                                     PETRA
                         Jesus Christ. You're going to have 
                         to go out the back. The data that 
                         you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, 
                         at six o'clock. Look it up. We're 
                         taking a trip. Be there at six and 
                         you'll have plenty to tell your 
                         people.

                                     XANDER
                         If I go out the back, he'll know 
                         you've warned me.

                                     PETRA
                         That's alright, I'll figure something 
                         out.

                                     XANDER
                         Not an option. Just get up slowly 
                         like everything's cool. Petra, trust 
                         me. You just hung yourself out to 
                         dry for me, I'm not gonna let you 
                         down.

               EXT. BAKERY ROOF - DAY

               Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his 
               SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE.

                P.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the 
               crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way 
               towards the exit.

                                     KIRILL
                         Nice and easy, Petra...

               INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

               They work their way through the lunchtime crowd.

                                     PETRA
                         I can't let this happen. I want you 
                         to go out the back. I'll make up 
                         some excuse.

                                     XANDER
                         They'll kill you, you know they will. 
                         Besides, there is no back door. Keep 
                         smiling. Ready? Now.

               EXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

               Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the 
               door, a BUS passes by.

               Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass.

                P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible 
               through the bus windows.

               Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger...

               As soon as the bus passes he FIRES!

               But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe.

               CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise, 
               Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block.

               He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the 
               sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows.

               At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL 
               RAIL down the middle.

               As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the 
               SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink 
               flying.

               He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does 
               a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too 
               fast for Kirill.

               He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE 
               AIR.

               Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon.

               By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in 
               frustration.

               Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a "Where 
               did he go?" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her 
               performance.

               Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO 
               speeding away.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON

               We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen 
               from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An 
               airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's 
               legendary "Troll Wall". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to 
               the ocean.

               Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear 
               webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each 
               thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced 
               MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship.

               Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is 
               precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff 
               is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen.

               FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military 
               style. He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low.

               HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: "6 PM"

               The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without 
               saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall.

               Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group 
               freefailing down the sheer cliff face.

                                     XANDER
                         Very nice.

               The six plummet away from him at incredible speed. In a hard 
               arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h.

               Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between 
               their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and 
               rocket away from the wall.

               Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation.

               ON THE SHIP BELOW --

               The ship below is a scientific research vessel. On the deck, 
               a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set.

               The six dark figures close in rapidly.

               At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide 
               towards the ship.

               A sailor looks up and spots them.

               Before he can shout, he's SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down.

               Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs.

               They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical 
               manner. They herd everyone back heading for the bridge.

               Petra hangs back. She looks back at the cliff, up towards 
               Xander.

               XANDER'S P.O.V.

               Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge.

               As they head inside, they disappear from view.

               Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.

                                     XANDER
                         Let's see what's going on inside...

               "PENETRATOR" P.O.V.

               Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP.

               He sees THE CREW, herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy 
               99.

               INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away. They slap 
               five and bump chests, still totally amped up.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE. It's white and twelve 
               feet long. There are MOTORS on either side and a PANEL OF 
               SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like projection rising 
               from the back.

               This is the AHAB DEVICE. It sits in the WET WELL at the back 
               of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.

                                     YORGI
                         Ready the boat.

               There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship.

               Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck. They start to WHISTLE 
               as they work. Sounds like the "Andy Griffith" theme.

               XANDER'S BINOCULARS P.O.V.

               He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell are you guys stealing?

               BACK ON THE SHIP

               The smaller boat is launched and ready to do. Yorgi goes to 
               the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch.

               The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. In 
               seconds Ahab starts to float. Anders loosens it from it's 
               moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER BOAT.

                                     KIRILL
                         Ready.

               Yorgi hits another switch, opening the BALLAST DOORS on the 
               port side of the ship. Air flows out, causing the ship to 
               list to one side.

                                     PETRA
                         What are you doing?

                                     YORGI
                         It all happened so fast. Such an 
                         unfortunate accident.

               Yorgi MACHINE GUNS the wet well control panel.

                                     YORGI
                         Let's go.

               They climb onto the boat. Petra is the last to board. She 
               looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more, 
               making sure he notices.

               XANDER'S P.O.V.

               He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being 
               towed behind. He pans over and ZOOMS IN on the shot-up control 
               panel.

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell...?

               He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding.

               With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts 
               LISTING. The thing is going down.

               He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the 
               Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped, 
               their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS.

               EXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up.

                                     XANDER
                         No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed 
                         to be an observer. Aw shit. This job 
                         sucks.

               He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle.

                                     XANDER
                         Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't 
                         work, your ass is kicked.

               Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths.

               Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff...

               And that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down.

               Suddenly we're falling with him.

               We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from 
               the craggy rock face.

               The force of the wind ripples his cheeks.

               He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away 
               from the cliff like Superman.

               Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE.

               Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE 
               LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL.

               Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards 
               the ship.

               EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

               Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi 
               from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him.

                                     YORGI
                         What was that for?

                                     PETRA
                         I'd forgotten how exciting it is 
                         working together.

                                     YORGI
                         You've been so quiet lately, Petra, 
                         I thought you no longer cared.

                                     PETRA
                         Why don't we go below decks and work 
                         off some of this adrenaline.

                                     YORGI
                              (smiles)
                         Viktor! Stay the course.

               Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing 
               deck and undoes his harness.

               He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck.

                                     XANDER
                         Son of a bitch!

               He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away.

               EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

               Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on 
               the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved.

               Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the 
               price.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in.

               With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below 
               decks.

               INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here 
               is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are 
               struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound.

               As the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in 
               from this one and Xander has to get it shut.

               He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN 
               holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising 
               rapidly, filling up the compartment.

               Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but 
               the force of the water is too much.

               He surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before 
               he can close that door.

               He watches as the Crew goes into a panic, the water rising 
               up to the ceiling. They are gasping in the last foot of air 
               that's available. He sees the Captain's Son, crying and 
               clutching at his father.

               Xander takes a deep breath and dives down. He grabs the hatch 
               door, braces his feet and PULLS.

               His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings 
               SHUT.

               Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder. He CUTS the Captain's 
               plastic cuffs.

                                     XANDER
                         Is the boy alright?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes. I will cut the others loose, 
                         you must run the bilge pumps!

               The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men.

               Xander takes the Captain's Son and climbs up the ladder.

               EXT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking 
               for. The Captain's Son shows him the right switch.

                                     XANDER
                         You sure?

               The Son nods and Xander flips the switch. MOTORS start to 
               HUM.

               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

               The bilge pumps spew out water furiously. Crew members come 
               up from below decks. They are soaked and grateful. They go 
               about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to 
               the exhausted Captain.

                                     XANDER
                         Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads 
                         with that uniform?

               They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               Xander is in a room with the SCIENTISTS from the ship. They 
               have blueprints of the torpedo spread out. The Captain's Son 
               is wrapped in BLANKETS, shivering.

               Xander is talking to Gibbons on his communicator.

                                     XANDER
                              (into communicator)
                         They call it "Ahab", it's a solar 
                         powered submersible. It can 
                         circumnavigate the globe on it's 
                         own. They use it to track and study 
                         the migration patterns of whales.

               INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN THE ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM

               Gibbons jots down the information furiously.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about 
                         that?

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's 
                         what I'm thinking. If they take out 
                         the cameras and sensors, they could 
                         probably put a bomb in this thing. 
                         You drop it in the water in the Red 
                         Sea and three weeks later it's 
                         swimming up the Potomac.

                                     GIBBONS
                         This is good work, X, damn fine work. 
                         You need to press on at all costs, 
                         find out what they have planned with 
                         this "Ahab".

                                     XANDER
                         Hey, one miracle at a time. They're 
                         on to me now, remember?

                                     GIBBONS
                         I'm gonna be en route with a team 
                         shortly to relieve you. Just keep 
                         the pressure on until the cavalry 
                         arrives. And X? You done yourself 
                         proud helping those people today.

               Xander tussles the hair of the Captain's Son.

                                     XANDER
                         Thanks.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You're a grungy little phoenix, you 
                         know that? Keep up the good work.

                                     XANDER
                         You ain't seen nothing yet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - DAY

               The GTO screeches into the lot. Shavers is on his way out 
               with his SUITCASE.

                                     XANDER
                         Get in. We've got work to do.

               INT. POLICE BUILDING BASEMENT - DAY

               PAN OVER WEAPONS - they're all laid out on the floor. 50 
               cal. MACHINE GUNS, MINES, ROCKETS, BELTS OF AMMO.

               We finally arrive at Xander leaning on his GTO. He sparks a 
               BLOWTORCH and lights a CIGAR.

                                     XANDER
                         I want all that...
                              (he pats the GTO)
                         In there.

               Shavers looks on in shock. He's got a crew of MECHANICS with 
               him. Xander hands him the blowtorch and walks away.

               EXT. PRAGUE OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

               This is a beautiful open air market in a town square 
               surrounded by old buildings. The place is PACKED.

               In the midst of it all, we make out Petra moving through the 
               crowd. She stops to look at some vegetables when Xander passes 
               by her.

                                     XANDER
                         Right behind you.

               They keep talking, pretending to shop.

                                     XANDER
                         So what's the plan with this Ahab? 
                         Are they selling it or what?

                                     PETRA
                         No, something worse. He says it's a 
                         surprise, but I know him. This is 
                         his masterpiece.

                                     XANDER
                         We've got to find out what it is. 
                         Can you handle that?

                                     PETRA
                              (beat)
                         There's something I didn't have time 
                         to tell you before.

                                     XANDER
                         What's that?

                                     PETRA
                         I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been 
                         undercover for over a year.

                                     XANDER
                         You're what? What the hell have you 
                         been doing?

                                     PETRA
                         I don't know. Eight months ago I 
                         stop hearing from my people. No 
                         explanation, just silence. So I stay 
                         and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm 
                         in so far, they'd kill me if I left. 
                         Now every day I get farther and 
                         farther away from what I was. I'm 
                         like you said, a criminal.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, 
                         what the hell are you doing? Those 
                         people almost drowned on that boat 
                         and you didn't lift a finger.

               This stings her. She knows well the price she paid.

                                     PETRA
                         No, I guess I've been no help at all 
                         to you.

                                     XANDER
                         Get your head back in the game. There 
                         are lives at stake here.

                                     PETRA
                         Of course. I'll do what I can. I 
                         have to go, before they notice.

                                     XANDER
                         When can I see you again?

                                     PETRA
                         You can't, it's too risky. I'm not 
                         much help anyway, remember?

               Then she's off into the crowd.

               EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - NIGHT

               The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander 
               approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK, 
               packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST.

               He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up 
               the side.

               He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house.

               VIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy.

               Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below.

               EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT

               Xander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX.

               He waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a 
               basement window.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - DARKENED ROOMS - NIGHT

               Xander makes his way through a series of rooms. Finally he 
               finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the 
               CAVERNOUS BASEMENT of the Manor.

               Laid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE, hanging from 
               chains. TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to 
               RETROFIT the thing.

               They are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES.

               Xander can't hear a thing through the thick glass.

               He takes a METAL BALL from his pocket. There's a sink in the 
               corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain.

               INT. DRAIN PIPE

               We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and 
               down into the wall. The pipe zigzags around like a 
               rollercoaster and then levels off.

               The ball rolls past a T-intersection, stops, and unrolls 
               like a pill bug.

               Six metal legs appear and we see it's the ROACH CAM. It 
               scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn.

               INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

               We're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe. It 
               scurries into hiding just as a HAND reaches in to turn on 
               the water.

               The roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we 
               PUSH IN on it's VIDEO CAMERA head.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON - VIDEO MONITOR - ROACH CAM P.O.V.

               We see a handheld video image of Viktor.

                                     VIKTOR
                         Okay, fire one.

               Viktor pushes a button on Ahab and a VODKA BOTTLE launches 
               from tube one, SHATTERING against the ceiling.

                                     YORGI
                         Perfect!

               Pull back to reveal Xander watching the image on his 
               communicator. Using a joystick he's able to control the roach.

               He steers the camera towards Petra, gets a low-angle shot of 
               her legs in a punked-out CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL SKIRT.

               He smiles, enjoying himself.

                                     XANDER
                         Great piece of hardware.

               He plugs his earpiece in and listens in.

               INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

               Petra works on a COMPUTER CONTROLLER.

               The roach scurries across the floor, circling to get a better 
               look at Ahab.

               Anders pushes a CART holding TEN GLASS CANISTERS OF LIQUID.

               Each canister is separated in two, with a BLACK LIQUID on 
               top and a WHITE LIQUID on the bottom.

               He hands the canisters to Viktor one by one.

                                     ANDERS
                              (singing)
                         "Silent Night... Holy Night"

               Viktor laughs and joins in.

               Then Kirill looks down and SPOTS THE ROACH CAM.

               He STOMPS it with his boot.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

               Xander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear.

                                     XANDER
                         Damn.

               He looks down into the room, sees Kirill bending down to 
               examine the roach. Time to go.

               INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

               Kirill lifts the dead "roach" and sees its wires.

                                     KIRILL
                         There's some bullshit going on!

               Yorgi hits an ALARM switch, alerting the guards.

               The Anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the 
               house.

               INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - VARIOUS - NIGHT

               The Anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced 
               close combat maneuvers.

               Cueing each other with hand signals, they run through each 
               room, weapons ready.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Xander sprints down the hallway. With the Anarchy 99 boys 
               and Guards roaming the house, he's having a hard time finding 
               his way out.

               INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

               He runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to 
               find the opposite door locked. He hides behind one of the 
               many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room.

               Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION 
               GOGGLES. He scans the big room but sees nothing.

               Xander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly.

               Kirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the 
               door.

                                     YORGI
                         Xander, my friend, that can only be 
                         you. Why don't we put our weapons 
                         down for a few minutes and discuss 
                         this like friends. How would you 
                         like to come to work for us instead? 
                         We could Rage Against the Machine 
                         together.

               Across the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the 
               courtyard. He has to run across open ground to reach it. He 
               calls out to Yorgi.

                                     XANDER
                         Speaking of people that are full of 
                         shit, funny you should mention those 
                         guys!

               Xander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it 
               impossible to pinpoint.

                                     XANDER
                         They put their records out through 
                         Sony, one of the biggest corporate 
                         machines on the planet. Some 
                         revolutionaries, huh?

               He pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer.

               Against the far wall Xander spots a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

                                     YORGI
                         Come on, you're the one who's fooling 
                         yourself. Why risk your life for 
                         your government when we can offer 
                         you a future that is truly free?

               Kirill is almost on top of him.

               Xander sights up and FIRES.

               The fire extinguisher EXPLODES, blinding Kirill.

               Xander makes a run for it.

               Everyone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra), bullets tearing 
               tapestries off the walls.

               Xander dives and crashes through the window.

               EXT. COURTYARD - SUNRISE

               Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running.

               Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going 
               on.

               Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby 
               and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM!

               The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up.

               He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a 
               "ramp" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE.

               A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim.

               Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by 
               he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL 
               before he can shoot.

               The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.

                                     YORGI
                         He blew the gate control. Anders! 
                         Get the bastard!

               Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine 
               gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him 
               go, hoping for the best.

               EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK

               (NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual 
               locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated 
               by a physical reason)

               Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind 
               him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end.

               At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall.

               Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of 
               the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel, 
               he hops onto the wall.

               The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the 
               top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows.

               They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide.

               They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping 
               neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes 
               a detour.

               He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER 
               CONSTRUCTION.

               INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING

               CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle 
               leaps into their building.

               Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE.

               Anders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE.

               Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x 
               4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE.

               More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander 
               goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes 
               onto the roof.

               EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING

               Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't 
               that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS.

               Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and 
               follows Xander.

               They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF 
               ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as 
               they race towards that last apartment building.

               Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump, 
               Xander pulls up behind Anders.

               They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps 
               on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right 
               behind him.

               They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced 
               on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories 
               below.

               He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep 
               his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control.

               Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie 
               and RAMS Anders over the edge.

               The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears 
               through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground.

               Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building.

               He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually 
               take him to street level.

               As he makes his way down, Anders stirs. The guy is a bloody, 
               broken mess but he gets to his feet. He sees where Xander is 
               headed and he scurries off to intercept him.

               EXT. ALLEY - MORNING

               Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. The 
               only way out is fenced in. But there's a RAMP leading up to 
               a LOADING DOCK. Xander will have to use that ramp to jump 
               the fence.

               Anders climbs to the second floor of the building. There is 
               a small crane arm loaded with metal. If he pushes it at the 
               right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike.

               He giggles maniacally, blood dripping.

               Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump.

               Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out.

               IN SLOW MOTION: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over 
               the fence.

               The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander.

               Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE, grabbing 
               onto the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB. He passes RIGHT 
               UNDERNEATH the swinging crane arm.

               Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on 
               with ONE HAND. In his OTHER HAND Xander's got his PISTOL.

               BLAP!

               Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. He stops, 
               sees Anders' BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley. He 
               tucks his pistol away and roars off.

               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Xander comes up the stairs and sees LIGHTS ON in his 
               apartment. He draws his gun and pushes the door open.

                                     XANDER
                         Slovo?

               Slovo is sitting in the armchair.

                                     XANDER
                         Dude, what are you doing here?

                                     SLOVO
                         You killed me, remember? Now I have 
                         to hide out here with you. Where 
                         have you been?

               Xander holsters his gun, searches around for his communicator.

                                     XANDER
                         I found something big enough for us 
                         to take these guys down with. They've 
                         got a of nerve agent they're gonna 
                         unleash.

                                     SLOVO
                         Is this what you're looking for?

               Xander turns to see Slovo waving the communicator.

                                     XANDER
                         Yeah, give it here.

               Slovo raises his pistol.

                                     SLOVO
                         Sorry, "dude".

                                     XANDER
                              (stunned beat)
                         What's the deal?

                                     SLOVO
                         Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got 
                         played, so what? You're new at this. 
                         Did you think you could just stroll 
                         into this business one day and have 
                         all the angles figured out?

                                     XANDER
                         Why you dogging me up?

                                     SLOVO
                              (shrugs)
                         They came and found me. They said 
                         they'd kill me unless I help them. 
                         Plus they offer me a lot of money. 
                         No big deal. These things happen. 
                         Dump your gun on the floor.

               Xander does so.

                                     SLOVO
                         Where do you want it? The head to be 
                         quick? Or the chest for an open 
                         casket?

               Suddenly GUNFIRE blasts through the closed door.

               Bullets shatter a LAMP, a PICTURE, and finally tag Slovo in 
               a wild salvo.

               Slovo crumples, never knowing what hit him.

               The door creaks open. It's Petra, her gun still smoking.

               She's with the Ivans.

                                     PETRA
                         Are you alright?

                                     XANDER
                         What the hell are you doing? You 
                         could've killed me!

                                     PETRA
                              (shrugs)
                         I heard you talking. I could tell 
                         where you were in the room.

                                     XANDER
                         I don't know what's going on anymore. 
                         I thought I was square with that 
                         dude. Now everybody's switching sides 
                         like it's the WWF.

               The Ivans go to Slovo's body, kicking the gun from his hands.

               One of them SPITS on his corpse in disgust.

                                     XANDER
                         What are you doing with the Ivans?

                                     PETRA
                         I know which cops are good and which 
                         are bad. Come with me. Come on, right 
                         now.

               She drags him to the door.

               EXT. ST. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY

               The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river. 
               There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE 
               PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it.

                                     XANDER
                         Where are we going?

                                     PETRA
                         We're getting out of this place. 
                         We've done enough.

                                     XANDER
                         Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go 
                         now. What's Yorgi got planned with 
                         that nerve agent?

                                     PETRA
                         It doesn't matter anymore, forget 
                         it.

                                     XANDER
                         Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!

                                     PETRA
                         What do we owe our governments? Yours 
                         kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.

                                     XANDER
                         Petra, this ain't about the people 
                         that sent us here, you know that.

                                     PETRA
                         No, now it's about us. Let's do 
                         something for us before we both get 
                         killed. Don't you want to get to 
                         Bora Bora, Xander?

                                     XANDER
                         We can't leave now. We have to do 
                         something.

                                     PETRA
                         Why? You're the one who believes in 
                         nothing. Screw the world, or whatever 
                         you said.

               Xander grabs her by shoulders.

                                     XANDER
                         Alright, so I was full of shit. I 
                         thought believing in things was wrong. 
                         Turns out believing in nothing is 
                         worse. You might as well be dead. 
                         I'm not thrilled with the world, but 
                         I'm not gonna let those idiots start 
                         killing people. Come on, you're a 
                         cop, we've got to get these guys.

               He's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement.

                                     PETRA
                         They left. To a fortress in the 
                         mountains.

                                     XANDER
                         We'll have to go after them.

                                     PETRA
                         Aren't you afraid?

                                     XANDER
                         A long time ago I learned how to put 
                         fear away in a little place in my 
                         head. Maybe that's my problem. If 
                         you don't feel fear you can do some 
                         amazing things, but you can also 
                         screw your life up in ways you can't 
                         imagine.

                                     PETRA
                         I must be healthy, then, because I'm 
                         scared to death. I guess I'd better 
                         get back to Yorgi.

                                     XANDER
                         You don't have to do that.

                                     PETRA
                         Yes, I do. You're right. I can't 
                         just let him go free. Besides, I can 
                         help you from the inside.

                                     XANDER
                         Aren't they gonna wonder were you've 
                         been?

                                     PETRA
                              (shrugs)
                         I was supposed to wait for the cop 
                         to kill you and then kill the cop. 
                         They'll believe me.
                              (beat)
                         I've been lying for so long, one 
                         more time won't hurt.

                                     XANDER
                         When this is over, we're just gonna 
                         take off, the two of us. Take a 
                         vacation.

                                     PETRA
                         What the hell are we doing? We're 
                         doing all this together, trusting 
                         each other, making plans, and we 
                         haven't even slept together yet.

               Xander kisses her.

                                     XANDER
                         That gives us something to live for.

               Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up, 
               revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big 
               BUILDING on the river.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

               We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock 
               strewn, near vertical drop.

               Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's 
               got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a 
               helluva climb.

               Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's 
               beautiful up here.

               He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch 
               and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on 
               his feet.

               Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of 
               the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval 
               fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down 
               the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something 
               else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging 
               to rocks for balance.

               On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a 
               GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been 
               spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on 
               SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants.

               EXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY

               Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the 
               Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his 
               men.

               A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER.

               Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE.

               All around him the Guards are driving into position. They 
               form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them.

               Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.

                                     VIKTOR
                         Hold positions!

               He squints up at the speck that is Xander.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

               Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket.

                                     XANDER
                         Nothing like fresh powder.

               He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade.

               Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER.

               The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING 
               DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing 
               down the mountain.

               The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with 
               a tremendous shock.

               There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight, 
               then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the 
               brink.

               Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at 
               his heels.

               From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards 
               watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.

               Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they 
               can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.

               There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and 
               ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes 
               a run for it as well.

               Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight 
               train, frothing like white water.

               Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a 
               JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof 
               of the Outpost.

               The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything 
               and everyone in its way.

               Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling 
               under the onslaught.

               Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over 
               the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a 
               stop.

               Then it's all quiet.

               Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's 
               nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.

               Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE, 
               he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his 
               flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for 
               good.

               Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's 
               right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to 
               BEEP.

                                     XANDER
                              (into communicator)
                         Gibbons, long time no talk. You 
                         wouldn't believe my day.

               INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS ON THE PRIVATE JET WITH A TEAM OF 
               AGENTS.

                                     GIBBONS
                         What the hell has been going on, 
                         Triple X? How about a status report?

               Xander looks down on the Castle. There seem to be MAFIYA 
               HENCHMEN all over the grounds.

                                     XANDER
                         Snow covered fortress. Army of bad 
                         guys. The usual.

                                     GIBBONS
                         I'm on the way with a team to relieve 
                         you. What's the latest?

                                     XANDER
                         They retrofitted Ahab with some kind 
                         of rocket launcher. They were loading 
                         canisters of liquid into it, light 
                         colored and dark colored in the same 
                         tube but separate. Something tells 
                         me this it that "classified" stuff 
                         you didn't want me to know about. 
                         Does the song "Silent Night" mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Yes it does.

                                     XANDER
                         Come on, Gibbons, you can do better 
                         then that.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Silent Night is the name of a top 
                         secret binary nerve agent. The glass 
                         canister is shot into the air and 
                         detonated. The black and white 
                         chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. 
                         When it settles down to Earth, it'll 
                         kill everything in the vicinity.

                                     XANDER
                         Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is 
                         something we came up with?

                                     GIBBONS
                         Yeah, that's right. So now that you 
                         know, you understand why it's 
                         important that we get it back.

                                     XANDER
                         Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're 
                         not supposed to be making weapons 
                         like that anyway. Guess we shoulda 
                         played by the rules.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Somebody else makes those decisions, 
                         not guys like you and me. You've 
                         done your job, X, head back to Prague. 
                         I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This 
                         is my operation now.

                                     XANDER
                         We don't have that kinda time, boss, 
                         I don't think Prague's gonna be around 
                         much longer. I've gotta go now. I've 
                         got a lot of bad guys to kill.

               Xander hangs up and heads down the hill.

               EXT. CASTLE - DAY

               A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. He 
               stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him.

               WHACK! With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps 
               walking. He's a man on a mission.

               He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. There's 
               no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. A canyon of 
               ROCKS is below.

               Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "TERMINATOR" 
               CLIMBING CLAWS. He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into 
               the solid rock.

               Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface.

               We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making 
               this impossible climb.

               At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's 
               rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky 
               chasm below.

               Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the 
               way with his climbing claws.

               At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander 
               grabs him and pulls him over the edge.

               The Guard FALLS into the chasm.

               Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD 
               rushes him, grabbing for his rifle.

               Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun 
               from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the 
               Guard down.

               He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower.

               INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level.

               As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he 
               just left.

               There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure 
               where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander.

                                     GUARD
                              (in Russian)
                         What's going on?

               Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops.

               Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi 
               appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT.

               Xander takes aim.

               POV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE

               From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights.

               BLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning.

               Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have 
               killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with 
               some Guards.

               Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face.

                                     YORGI
                         That was for Anders.

                                     XANDER
                         Don't forget goatee boy. I greased 
                         him up on the diamond run.

               Yorgi punches him again.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with 
               Xander and Kirill.

                                     YORGI
                         Look who we found playing outside.

               Petra looks up. She can barely hide her shock.

                                     YORGI
                         Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice 
                         anything strange about X? He looks 
                         slightly less than dead.

               Kirill aims his gun at Petra.

                                     PETRA
                         Yorgi, I thought he was --

               Yorgi SLAPS her.

                                     YORGI
                         Do you think I didn't know about you 
                         all along? My contacts in the KGB 
                         told me you were coming. You show up 
                         undercover and, I must admit, you 
                         play your part to the hilt. When 
                         it's time to be cruel, you are cruel. 
                         When it's time to be passionate, you 
                         are very very passionate indeed.

               Petra is devastated by this revelation.

                                     YORGI
                         I could have killed you, but I thought 
                         this would be so much more fun. To 
                         twist you and use you how I see fit. 
                         And to be honest, you went much 
                         farther than I ever expected you 
                         would for your country.

               He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander.

                                     YORGI
                         And you. Why do you have such a 
                         problem staying away, my friend? Did 
                         you miss us that much?

                                     XANDER
                         I wanted to get the hell out of Prague 
                         before Silent Night falls.

                                     YORGI
                         Not bad, man, not bad. You put things 
                         together quick. Prague it is.

                                     PETRA
                         The Peace conference...

                                     YORGI
                         Nice place to start, don't you think?

                                     XANDER
                         What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's 
                         the part I don't get. You gonna hold 
                         the world hostage with your gas bombs? 
                         I didn't think you were dumb enough 
                         to go with that hack cliche.

                                     YORGI
                         You think I'm after money? I told 
                         you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a 
                         change. Money is good, but for true 
                         freedom you have to get rid of the 
                         rules themselves.

                                     XANDER
                         So all by yourself, you're going to 
                         destroy every government; in the 
                         world.

                                     YORGI
                         Easier than that, buddy. I'll get 
                         them to destroy each other. You kill 
                         an entire Peace conference, someone 
                         is going to have to pay. Then our 
                         friend Ahab continues down the river 
                         to the ocean and begins his world 
                         tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty 
                         soon everyone's involved. These guys 
                         bomb those guys, those guys invade 
                         these guys. Soon the whole world is 
                         like your wild West cowboy days. No 
                         rules, no law, everybody free to do 
                         what they want.

                                     XANDER
                         Including rape, pillage, murder.

                                     YORGI
                         Sure, if that's what you want. Why 
                         not? It's all human nature. So we 
                         just have to launch our baby and 
                         wait for the decline and fall of 
                         civilization as we know it.

                                     XANDER
                         And here I thought "anarchy" was 
                         just something cool to put on a 
                         Tshirt.

                                     YORGI
                         Come on, Xander. You used to stand 
                         for something. What happened to you, 
                         man? I thought you'd get it.

                                     PETRA
                         Don't you see, X? For the betterment 
                         of humanity, he's going to start 
                         World War Three.

                                     XANDER
                         He's a regular humanitarian. And all 
                         this time I thought he was just a 
                         tool.

                                     YORGI
                         You both could have been a part of 
                         it. You could have ridden with us 
                         into a new day, the dawning of a new 
                         age of --

                                     XANDER
                         Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry 
                         I asked.

               Yorgi's eye twitches.

                                     YORGI
                         Screw you too, buddy.

               He raises his gun and suddenly BOOOOOM! A massive explosion 
               rocks the whole castle. Shrapnel shatters the windows, 
               spraying glass, and Yorgi's shot goes wide.

               EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

               The front gates have just been blown apart. Through the smoke 
               and wreckage come Ivans 1 & 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK CZECH 
               SECRET POLICE. Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot 
               bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               Kirill looks down at the carnage below. Xander takes advantage 
               of the distraction and charges at Yorgi.

               Yorgi goes to shoot but his hand won't work. There's a HUGE 
               SHARD OF GLASS sticking through his forearm.

               By the time he pulls it out, Xander is on top of him. He 
               body checks Yorgi, sending him flying over a desk. Kirill 
               spins and starts FIRING. Xander ducks for cover.

               EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

               The Czech Secret Police are having their way. They cross the 
               courtyard and burst into the main building.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               The Police whip through the building like lightening, mowing 
               down everyone in their path.

               One Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others retaliate 
               with a volley of RPG's that evaporates a pocket of resistance.

               In the main room upstairs, Kirill is blasting away. Yorgi 
               starts rounding up the computer gear.

                                     YORGI
                         Hurry up, kill him!

               Before Kirill can do so, Cops burst into the room, spraying 
               bullets everywhere.

               Xander and Petra are pinned down, but Yorgi and Kirill manage 
               to make a fast exit out another door.

                                     XANDER
                         Hey! We're on your side!

               The Cops keep shooting.

               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him 
               and shoots him in the back.

               They step over him and enter a GARAGE.

               INT. CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY

               The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK. Yorgi and 
               Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear.

               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across 
               the courtyard.

               Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts 
               heading down the mountain.

               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

               Meanwhile, Xander and Petra are still pinned down.

                                     XANDER
                         Petra! Tell them something!

               Petra starts calling out in RUSSIAN. Finally the cops stop 
               shooting.

               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

               Xander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police 
               working on the wounded Ivan 1. Ivan 2 walks up.

                                     XANDER
                         How's Ivan?

                                     IVAN 2
                         He is okay.

                                     XANDER
                         Thanks for coming, man, you guys 
                         were right on time.

                                     IVAN 2
                         We are always on time. Two have 
                         escaped, in truck.

                                     PETRA
                         Yorgi and Kirill.

                                     XANDER
                         Let me guess, they had a big white 
                         torpedo with them.

                                     IVAN 2
                         Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he 
                         send something for you.

               EXT. CASTLE - DAY

               A big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's 
               blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out.

                                     IVAN 2
                         We'll be right behind you.

               Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols.

                                     XANDER
                         Did you do your homework?

                                     PETRA
                              (nods)
                         If they launch it, I know how to 
                         bring it back.

                                     XANDER
                         Let's do this.

               They both climb in and the GTO peels out.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up.

               He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip.

               Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the 
               mountain.

                                     XANDER
                         Where's he headed?

                                     PETRA
                         He owns a big industrial complex on 
                         the river. He'll launch it from there.

               Xander floors it.

               Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the 
               GTO gaining on them.

                                     YORGI
                              (in Russian, subtitled)
                         They're coming! Get back there.

               Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He 
               lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container.

               As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK! 
               The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows 
               the headrest off Xander's seat.

                                     XANDER
                         You get down! I'll take care of this 
                         fool!

               He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window.

                                     PETRA
                         No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind 
                         the nerve agent!

               Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror.

                                     XANDER
                         Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing 
                         around soon and shoot something 
                         valuable!

               Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the 
               sights.

               Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide.

               The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain.

               Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns.

               The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex 
               up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

               The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex.

               Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen 
               up above.

               The GTO comes at the gates at full speed.

                                     XANDER
                         Let's see what my man put together.

               Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He 
               flips one.

               The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER.

               BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.

               The metal doors are getting SHREDDED.

               Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO.

               The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks.

               The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down.

               A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the 
               GTO zips inside.

               EXT. INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

               The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here.

               Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere.

               A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping-pong ball sized 
               MINIBOMBS dump onto the road. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The bombs 
               send the Guards scattering.

               The GTO sizzles away.

                                     XANDER
                         Where'd the damn truck go?!

                                     PETRA
                         Go to the water, it's that way!

               A tactical (a pick-up with a .50 cal machine gun attached) 
               pulls up behind them and opens fire.

                                     XANDER
                         Toadies right behind.

                                     PETRA
                         Let me.

               Petra punches another button.

               The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their 
               own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES.

               As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW 
               UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical.

               All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control.

               It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the 
               men going sprawling.

                                     PETRA
                         Fantastic options.

               At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck 
               and prepare for launching.

               They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into 
               the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's 
               insides.

                                     YORGI
                         I've got it, go! Cover me!

               Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off.

               He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building 
               on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes 
               his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear.

               When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES.

               The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering 
               column.

               Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building.

               Petra clutches her arm, wounded.

                                     XANDER
                         You okay?

                                     PETRA
                         A piece of shrapnel hit me.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop 
                         playing nice.

               Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make 
               their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning 
               in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as 
               he can.

               Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't 
               have much of a target.

                                     KIRILL
                         What are you doing!

               He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a 
               HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER.

               ANGLE ON - the missile launcher's COMPUTER SCREEN. The green 
               display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. Its 
               the GLOWING POINT of Kirill's lit cigarette.

               The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES.

               Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at 
               him.

               He gets it immediately. In a panic he fumbles for the 
               cigarette...

               Too late. The missile zeroes in on his head.

               WHOOOSH! The entire wooden shack blows apart.

               Xander walks up to Petra.

                                     XANDER
                         I guess the surgeon general was right.

               ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The 
               electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river.

               Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi 
               escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see 
               the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination.

               Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She 
               presses buttons desperately.

                                     PETRA
                         He's shut out the communication 
                         circuit!

                                     XANDER
                         You can't talk to it?

                                     PETRA
                         No, it's like a safety. We are going 
                         to have to access the manual controls.

                                     XANDER
                         A manual control on a moving torpedo. 
                         This day keeps getting better and 
                         better.

               Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT.

                                     XANDER
                         Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going 
                         down! Have them evacuate downtown!

               EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

               Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and 
               sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his 
               steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on 
               them and he reloads his weapons.

               Xander drives while Petra checks her controller.

                                     PETRA
                         It's running three meters down. Twenty 
                         knots.

                                     XANDER
                         It has to surface to release the 
                         nerve agent, right?

                                     PETRA
                         By then it's too late! The only way 
                         to safely dispose of the nerve agent 
                         is in deep water! The chemicals will 
                         break down and dissipate!

                                     XANDER
                         Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow 
                         it up underwater!

               They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank 
               getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast.

               Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath 
               the water.

                                     PETRA
                         There it is! Hold it steady!

               Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front 
               of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind. 
               She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's 
               boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet 
               GRAZES Petra's arm.

                                     XANDER
                         Petra!

               She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the 
               engine compartment.

               Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's 
               boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge 
               support and shatters.

               They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's 
               full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing 
               in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and

               Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.

                                     PETRA
                         Xander! It's coming up!

               Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi 
               clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra 
               tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.

               Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs 
               him from behind in a chokehold.

                                     YORGI
                         This is going to be exciting, buddy! 
                         Front row seats to the apocalypse! 
                         Come on, sing with me!
                              (singing madly)
                         "I am an Antichrist / I am an 
                         anarchist / I... wan-na be... 
                         Anarchy!"

               Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips 
               him and they both topple overboard.

               They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel 
               each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding 
               torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. 
               Charles bridge.

               On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF 
               PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from 
               the river.

               Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi 
               slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in 
               the torpedo's wake.

               Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.

               Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing 
               Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.

                                     XANDER
                         No you don't.

               He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is 
               BEEPING menacingly.

               IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his 
               hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he 
               doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.

               He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the 
               bridge above him. Total strangers...

               The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former 
               nihilist.

               Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with 
               his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.

               Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the 
               water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab 
               starts to DIVE.

               EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

               With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside 
               down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.

               Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men 
               fighting.

               We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on 
               Ahab and continues downstream.

               Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.

               It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES, 
               setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and 
               it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.

               The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds.

               EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

               A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils.

               EXT. THE RIVERBANK - DAY

               Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the 
               water, but there's no sign of Xander.

               Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE, 
               scanning the water. Nothing.

               Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.

               Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.

               There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they 
               see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.

               The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water, 
               walking up the boat ramp.

               His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's 
               a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't 
               seen before. The Phoenix has risen.

               Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander 
               shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Thought you bought the farm down 
                         there, X. Glad as hell to see you.

                                     XANDER
                         I'm pretty happy to see me too. So 
                         are you done with me yet?

                                     GIBBONS
                         You've kept up your end of the 
                         bargain, I'll do the same. But you 
                         really should consider staying on, 
                         you make a decent agent.

                                     XANDER
                         But I hate cops, remember? Except 
                         for her.

                                     GIBBONS
                         Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. 
                         You're a hero. Don't be afraid to 
                         join the good guys.

                                     XANDER
                         Who says you're the good guys?

               He starts walking off with Petra.

                                     GIBBONS
                         You know what they say, the only way 
                         to change the system is from the 
                         inside.

                                     XANDER
                         Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking 
                         this thing off my ankle? The poison 
                         needles?

                                     GIBBONS
                         On come on, X. Did you really think 
                         we were that barbaric?

                                     XANDER
                         No needles, huh? What about the acid 
                         bath?

                                     GIBBONS
                         All for show. Just a psychological 
                         mind game to get you to do the right 
                         thing.

                                     XANDER
                              (smiles)
                         You're a jerk-off, you know that?

               Gibbons waves.

                                     GIBBONS
                         We'll be talking soon, you'll see. 
                         You'll be back.

               Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm.

                                     PETRA
                         I can't believe my mission is finally 
                         over. I don't even know what to do 
                         with myself.

                                     XANDER
                         You can't welch on me now. We had a 
                         deal.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANGLE ON - a big "X" spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand.

               The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white 
               beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island... BORA BORA...

               Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A THIRD "X" BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER'S HEAD.

               INT. HUT - DAY

               His ink done, Xander walks out onto the back deck.

               EXT. BORA BORA - DAY

               Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water.

               Xander steps out of a hut built over the water.

               We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. She's got 
               a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down. It's a vision of 
               heaven.

               He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom 
               off.

                                     PETRA
                              (laughing)
                         What are you doing?

                                     XANDER
                         It's about your next mission. You 
                         need to be debriefed.

               FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon 
               nude. There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we 
               know what they're up to.

               Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses 
               of their outlines beneath the water.

               The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's 
               COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers. We hear them 
               surface and start SPLASHING off camera.

               Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP.

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
YEAR ONE

                                                    October 18th, 2007

          

          IN THE BEGINNING...       1

          
          BLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY, a
          particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains
          all the potential matter and energy in the universe.

          THE BIG BANG
          A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes,
          particles expanding in all directions until they fill the
          screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust.
          Then the particles start to attract one another to form
          atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the
          molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell
          twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby
          heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms.
          Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a
          much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and
          pull back to reveal--

          THE SEA                   2
          Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in
          a cloudless azure sky.
          A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit
          to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted,
          long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection. Then a MAN rises
          up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the
          surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect--
          short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace.
          It's paradise-- for him.

          THE WOMAN
          (looking deep in his eyes)
          I'm so hungry.

          THE MAN
          (wanting her)
          Yeah. Me, too.
          The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to
          kiss her, but she turns and walks away.

          WOMAN
          What should we eat?

          THE MAN
          Oh, you actually meant you were
          hungry. I thought-- forget it.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                     2.
          He follows her.
          They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach. When they
          reach the line of vegetation, the woman, MAYA, kneels, pulls
          berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth.
          The man, ZED, grabs a handful of berries and they squat there
          noshing like Adam and Eve.

          THE WOMAN
          Mmmm, these are so good.

          THE MAN
          Mmrrunm, they really are .
          When she turns away he spits them out in disgust.
          Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips
          almost touching.

          MAYA
          (very sexy)
          You know what I'd really like?

          ZED

          (HOPEFULLY)
          What?

          MAYA
          Some fruit.

          ZED
          (frustrated, but hanging

          IN                                                              )
          Yeah, fruit's good.
          (he stands up)
          You want an apple or a pear?

          MAYA

          (THINKS)
          No.
          He scans the nearby trees.

          ZED
          Orange? Tangerine?
          (she shakes her head)
          Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach?
          She shakes her head coyly.

          Because that's the fruit we don't

          No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't
          have that many rules. In fact, we
          only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THAT

          FRUIT.

          MAYA
          Okay, fine. We won't. Forget I
          mentioned it. I understand if
          you're afraid--

          I'm not "afraid"--

          No, really, it's all right. I just
          thought you might be curious why we
          can eat everything else that walks,
          crawls, swims, flies, or grows in
          the ground, but not that particular
          fruit. And I thought you might be

          take a chance and start thinking
          for himself, but I guess I was
          wrong.
          She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's
          not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived
          and will ever live, he caves.

          He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands
          her one. They both stare at the fruit.

          You first.

          No way! It was your idea. You go
          first.

          We both bite at the same time.
          Zed considers for a long moment then decides.

          ZED
          Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three!
          Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him
          out and stops before her teeth break the skin.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

          going to steal it.
          He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste
          of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he
          spits it out.

          So you're saying it's not good?

          ZED
          Yes! I'm saying it's not good!
          He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a
          loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up.

          celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR
          on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs
          in honor of the kill.
          The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony,
          Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops
          it at Maya's feet.

          Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut,
          his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him
          sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy,
          jealous of the attention they're getting from the women.
          If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar
          opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would
          apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He
          may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been
          invented he'd be wearing them.

          OH

          (GRUMBLING)
          Look at them. Hunters think
          they're so cool. They don't think
          gathering is dangerous? There are
          thorns-- bees-- those big stingy
          ants. I could hunt-- I just don't
          want to. And what's with the blood
          on their faces? They think that's
          sanitary?

          Why did you eat that fruit? It's
          forbidden. Everybody knows that.

          ZED
          I couldn't help myself! Maya was
          just staring at me with those pouty
          eyes-- and those perky breasts--
          opposable thumbs. And how about
          the name? "The Tree of the
          Knowledge of Good and Evil"? You
          don't think that sounds tempting?
          They should've just called it "The
          Tree with the Fruit that Tastes
          Like Shit." Then for sure nobody
          would eat it.

          Why does everyone have to crap
          right behind my hut?

          OH
          I think, and I could be wrong, that
          all the poop makes the ground more
          fertile, which in turn, gives the
          leaves in the area a softer feel.
          It's a vicious circle.
          Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the
          communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)

          Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave,
          then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh
          that makes them laugh.

          but I don't think I'd lay with her.

          OH
          Of course not! She's your sister!
          It'd be like sleeping with your
          mother.

          ZED
          which was a big mistake. I see
          that now. You think it won't be
          awkward the next morning but--
          trust me, you just want to rip your
          eyeballs out.

          Listen, if you want to impress
          Eema, tonight at the feast, do the
          fertility dance with her, then drag
          her back to your hut.

          struggles?

          of a hunter's spear.

          I wouldn't read too much into that.
          She kisses, then tongues the spear tip.

          some lines on a skin.

          ZED

          It's not a real bear. It's a

          one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and
          holds it upside down.

          just goes on and on forever? Or
          what if it's round?
          (he picks up a round

          ROCK))
          And if you keep walking you
          eventually come right back to where
          you started?
          He traces the circumference with his finger.

          OH

          (SCOFFS)
          Oh, yeah, that's plausible.
          Zed flings the rock away.

          A VILLAGER (O.C.)
          Oww!

          ZED
          (waves apologetically)
          Sorry!

          OH
          (tries to cheer him up
          Will you stop with that crazy talk?
          We're at a feast. You love feasts.
          There's women, there's boar meat,
          there's an assortment of berries--
          there's women--
          Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it.

          ZED
          Do it, man! Go dance for her.

          OH
          You think? They're playing the
          Jackal Dance. I don't do that one
          so well.

          ZED
          Are you kidding? Go! Jackal
          Dance!
          Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the
          girls are sitting.
          Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows
          and licks his lips. She laughs and looks away.
          Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly
          jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool.
          Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to
          talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help.
          Zed mimes clonking her on the head.
          Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin.
          However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed,
          stands up and decks him with one punch.

          Eema glowers at Zed who feigns innocence.

          A hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other
          tribesmen. Zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for
          food and goes to the front.

          ZED
          Excuse me, hunter coming through.

          VILLAGERS
          Hey! Wait your turn! There's a
          line here, buddy!

          ZED
          For your information I was in line
          and I just stepped out to chew some
          food for an elderly lady.
          Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping
          him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort,
          ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.

          MARLAK
          Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the
          garden with Maya.

          ZED
          Oh, really? And what if I called
          Enmebaragesi a liar?

          ENMEBARAGESI
          I'd kill you.

          ZED
          Calm down. I said "what                                     if"-- it
          was a hypothetical.
          Marlak gets right in Zed's face.

          MARLAK
          Enmebaragesi doesn't lie.
          Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them.
          Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat.
          MARLAK (cont'd)
          The truth!

          MAYA
          Zed, just admit it. You're just
          making it harder on yourself.

          ZED
          (instantly annoyed)
          No, you just made it harder on
          myself!
          (to Marlak)
          Okay, fine, you got me.
          (gingerly moves the spear

          POINT)
          Maya and I lay together on
          occasion. We're consenting adults
          and we have an adventurous sexual
          relationship.
          Maya looks shocked, and tries to signal Zed to shut up.

          MARLAK

          (STUNNED)
          You laid with my woman?

          ZED
          Isn't that what we're talking
          about?
          Maya rolls her eyes.

          ENMEBARAGESI
          No, I saw you eat the Forbidden
          Fruit.

          ZED
          Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the
          fruit. I was just kidding about
          humping Maya.
          Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops.
          Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed.

          OH

          (FORCEFUL)
          Hey! What's going on?
          Marlak growls at him.
          OH                                                        (cont'd)

          SKY)
          Oooh, shooting star.

          Zed gets to his feet.

          ZED
          Look, Marlak, this is crazy.
          You're two of me. I'm not gonna
          fight you over a girl, okay?
          Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD
          HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an
          unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose.
          Zed                                                            (cont'd)
          (to Enmebaragesi)
          And let that be a lesson to your
          big friend-
          Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid-
          section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends
          him sprawling to the ground.

          MARLAK
          (standing over Zed)
          Your father was a great hunter, but
          you're like-- a girl.
          The hunters laugh.

          ENMEBARAGESI
          Good one, Marlak.

          ANOTHER HUNTER
          Zing.

          MARLAK
          Now I kill you.
          He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and
          jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman
          howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed.

          SHAMAN
          (leaning close to Zed)
          We need to talk.

          Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log, talking
          privately.

          The Shaman is covered in skins, feathers, bones, beads,
          animal teeth, antlers and horns, his hair a mass of long,
          muddy dreadlocks, his face painted, his cheeks, nose, and
          ears pierced by shards of bone. But if not for his
          outlandish getup, zed could be talking to his pastor.

          SHAMAN
          You really ate the fruit?

          ZED
          One bite! What's the big deal?

          SHAMAN
          (halfheartedly shakes a
          chicken-foot rattle at

          HIM)
          You don't eat the fruit! That's
          been the number one rule from the
          beginning of time. Since the Great
          Turtle climbed from the sea with
          the Earth on his back, drank the
          ocean, pooped out the mountains and
          the first man fell from the stars.

          ZED
          I've always had trouble with the
          Great Turtle Theory-- too many
          unexplained gaps.

          SHAMAN
          Whatever. You're screwed now.

          ZED
          Really? How screwed? Like I knew
          it was a rule but I'm a little
          fuzzy on the exact details.

          SHAMAN
          You're cursed, man, and if you stay
          here then we'll all be cursed. You
          have to leave.

          ZED
          Where am I supposed to go?

          SHAMAN
          Up to you. From now on you're
          completely on your own.

          Am I detecting a little jealousy
          here because I now have the
          knowledge of good and evil and you
          don't? Well, you know what? I say
          what I did was a good thing-- a
          very very good thing-- and I'm not
          leaving. What do you think of
          that?
          A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at
          his feet.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Okay, is that supposed to be funny?
          He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing
          around them in a wide circle.
          Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield,
          starting a rhythmical beat. The other hunters join in,
          keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent

          SHAMAN
          (to Zed, re the hunters)
          You should probably get going now.
          You better take this knife.
          He hands him a flint knife with a leather-wrapped handle.
          SHAMAN                                                          (cont'd)
          And some of the guys got together
          and they want you to have this bow.
          He hands him a strong hunter's bow.

          ZED
          I don't want to seem ungrateful or
          anything, but you wouldn't happen
          to have any arrows, would you?
          An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head.

          SHAMAN
          (to Zed)
          You'd better get moving.
          Zed looks around at his fellow villagers, trying to summon
          what dignity he has left.

          ZED

          (DEFIANT)
          Okay, but before I go I just want
          to say something. I know I'm not

          Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got
          to be more to life than this--
          (to Hunters)
          Kinda hard to concentrate with that
          rhythmic drumming, fellas.
          The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

          Anyways, I'm going away, not
          because you're forcing me to--
          which you are-- but because I
          choose to. Yes, I ate from the
          Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
          Evil-- major misunderstanding on my
          part-- and believe me I'm not
          recommending it unless you're
          interested in a very powerful
          laxative-- but it got me thinking
          about some pretty heavy stuff --
          life questions, you know. So I'm
          out of here, and anyone who wants
          to join me is welcome.
          He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak
          staring at her and averts her eyes.

          lighting up the darkness-- pointing
          us in the right direction, and
          keeping us entertained with
          humorous anecdotes from my
          childhood. Now who's with me?
          He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air.

          Okay, then I guess I'll just have
          to go it alone, which is fine with

          ME--
          (to Oh)
          --better, in fact, because having a
          partner would just slow me down.
          Oh can't look at him.
          Zed shakes his head, failing to notice that the torch he's
          holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him.
          The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)

          I know there's a lesson in here
          somewhere. Any thoughts?
          The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts.
          It's chaos.

          MARLAK
          (raises his spear, to Zed)
          Now you die.
          Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running
          into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the
          whole village ablaze.

          Zed runs for his life through the dense forest.
          The hunters chase him, shooting arrows at him on a dead run.
          Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him. He veers left, then
          right, then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment.
          The hunters stop at the top of the embankment. Marlak
          listens for sounds of movement in the forest below, then
          silently signals for the hunters to fan out.

          Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment, reaches the
          bottom and sees something in the moonlight.
          It's Zed lying on the ground, badly camouflaged with sticks
          and leaves, thinking he can't be seen, but the shape of his
          body is clearly discernible. Marlak raises his spear.

          MARLAK
          I see you.

          ZED
          (long beat)
          No, you don't.

          Yes, I do.

          ZED
          How can you see me if I'm not here?

          MARLAK
          You're trying to trick me.

          ZED
          Okay, then tell me this-- who's
          standing right behind you?

          MARLAK
          (nobody's fool)
          You think I'm going to turn around
          and look, but I'm not.
          (pulls his knife)
          I'm going to gut you like a pig.
          He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is
          struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily,
          knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the
          makeshift club.
          Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh.

          OH
          I guess I'm with you.

          ZED
          Was it my speech?

          OH
          No, the fire. I lost everything.

          ZED
          But the speech was pretty good,
          right? I mean, even I was moved
          and I was the one speaking.

          OH
          Can we talk about this later?
          Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep
          woods.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          CRICKETS. Zed and Oh walk through the moonlit forest.

          ZED
          This is nice, out here, the two of
          us.

          OH

          (SULLEN)
          Yeah, it's great.

          ZED
          Come on, those hunters are idiots.
          In an hour they'll forget the whole
          thing.

          OH
          I don't think they'll forget the
          fire.

          ZED
          You know what we should do? You
          and me should kill the biggest boar
          ever-- just huge!-- and take it
          back to the village. Just to show
          them. And we won't let anyone else
          eat it. They'll have to watch us
          eat it.

          OH
          If it's that huge how would we
          carry it back?

          ZED

          (CONSIDERING)
          Fine, we'll just start with
          something small. A squirrel or
          something.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                            22.

          OH
          Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us
          eat a squirrel. Will you get real?
          There's no going back! There's,
          nothing to go back to! It's just
          ashes.

          ZED

          (SCOFFS)
          Yeah, like it's so hard to build a
          new hut. It's just a pile of
          sticks and dung--

          OH

          (SCOWLS)
          You're a pile of sticks and dung.
          Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still.

          ZED
          (through clenched teeth)
          Oh!

          OH
          What are you doing?
          Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up.
          A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap.
          Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.

          ZED
          Don't move a muscle.

          OH
          Will that work?

          ZED
          (without moving his lips)
          I don't know. There's two
          different opinions on this one.
          Some say run, some say don't.

          OH
          What are you going to do?

          ZED
          I'm going to-- RUN!
          He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh.

          CUT TO:

          Zed is holding a stick over the fire, cooking what looks like
          a squirrel or a muskrat.
          Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks
          and branches. One of Oh's sticks falls, and as he carefully
          reaches down to grab it, the rest spill out on the ground.
          Oh sighs. His body is covered with long claw marks.

          ZED
          You really should put some maggots
          on those scratches. They look
          pretty deep.

          OH

          (BITTER)
          I just want to know why you told me
          not to move, and you ran.

          ZED
          Because I honestly thought he'd go
          for me. I thought I was doing you
          a favor. Apparently not
          appreciated.

          OH
          Yeah, big favor.

          ZED
          You didn't have to come with me,
          you know. I didn't ask you to
          come.

          OH
          Yes, you did! You looked right at
          me-- twice.

          ZED
          Yes, that's a technique of public
          speaking, but I didn't ask you
          specifically. You chose to come.
          You gotta take some responsibility
          for that. And there's no point
          coming if you're just gonna keep
          whining about every little-- cougar
          that attacks you.
          (pulls the cooked rodent
          from the fire)
          You want some or not?

          OH

          (HUFFY)
          No, eat your weasel. You deserve
          it.
          He turns his back to Zed, and starts sorting through the pile
          of sticks.

          ZED
          You making your own fire?

          OH
          No, arrows. We're going to need
          them.

          ZED
          (perks up)
          You're still coming?

          OH

          (RESIGNED)
          Yes.
          Zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly. Oh
          winces in pain.

          CUT TO:

          Zed and Oh are hiking uphill, the lush, dense verdure of the
          forest now thinning to evergreens and mountain heather.

          CUT TO:

          12                                                              THE MOUNTAINS - LATER   12
          Zed and Oh climbing higher now. Finally, they reach the top
          and look out at the vista.
          From their vantage point they can see a high plateau and
          wooded land stretching far beyond it.

          ZED

          (GLOATING)
          I knew it! Still think you're just
          gonna fall off the edge of the
          world?

          OH
          (in amazement)
          Incredible.
          He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his
          feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way
          down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long,
          tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom.

          ZED

          (WINCES)
          Oooh.                                                           -

          Zed is following a trail downhill through the forest on the
          other side of the mountains. Oh is limping along behind him,
          bitten, clawed, cut, scraped and bruised.

          ZED
          Say what you want, but that was no
          accident. You don't see a pattern
          here?

          OH
          I see a pattern. Every time
          something terrible can happen to
          me, it does.

          ZED
          Yeah, but why? Why'd the cougar go
          for you and not me? Why did you
          fall and I didn't? Hard to believe
          it's all just random. Think about

          (sniffing the air)
          People-- more than one-- walking--
          (he guesses) that way.

          OH

          You think? There's about a
          thousand footprints here.

          Yes! There!
          He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes.
          Zed                                                             (cont'd)
          They stopped here to poop. Look.

          OH
          No, thank you.

          Four men, maybe five. And a child--
          or a small women maybe.

          Okay.

          ZED
          (poking at the evidence)

          dried fruit-- some kind of green
          leafy vegetable--

          OH
          Okay! Enough! Can we just go?
          Maybe we can find where they peed.

          stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and
          they peer through the bushes.
          THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well-
          tended fields of growing grain.
          Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals
          Oh to be quiet and stay put.

          ZED

          (WHISPERS)
          This one's mine.
          He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly
          draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows. He
          shoots.
          The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and
          bounces off. The cow looks up.

          

          

          

          
                                                                        Official White              27.

          (to Oh)
          We're gonna need some arrowheads.
          Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the
          forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back.
          Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying.
          Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED
          YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring
          at him.

          FIRST YOUNG FARMER
          Did you just shoot my cow?

          ZED
          (getting painfully to his

          FEET)
          Yeah, well-- we're hunters.

          OH
          (covering for himself)
          He's a hunter. I'm more of a
          "maker." I made this loincloth, I
          do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for
          my hut--

          ZED
          What do you guys do?

          SECOND YOUNG FARMER
          What does it look like? We're
          farmers.

          FIRST YOUNG FARMER
          He's a farmer; I'm a herdsman.

          SECOND YOUNG FARMER
          You're a suck, is what you are.

          FIRST YOUNG FARMER
          (ignores him)
          My brother, Cain. I am called

          You are called suck.

          "God looked on my sacrifice with

          FAVOR--"
          (to Oh)
          Okay, is he a total suck or what?

          OH
          Well, it's hard to say-- we just

          MET--

          ABEL
          Why are you dragging them into
          this? What do they know? They're
          morons.

          ZED

          (OFFENDED)
          Hey! Easy!

          CAIN
          (to Abel)
          You think you're so superior to
          everyone else.

          ABEL
          Superior-er than you.

          CAIN
          Really? Let's see how good you are
          at getting your ass kicked.
          (shoves him)

          ABEL
          Yeah? Bring it!
          (shoves him back)

          ZED
          Okay, boys, that's enough. We just
          want to--

          CAIN
          (won't let it go)
          No! This smug asshole insulted you
          and I want him to take it back.

          ZED
          We're not really that insulted--

          CAIN
          (pushes Abel hard)
          Take it back!

          ABEL
          (pushes back)
          Make me!
          Zed steps between them, trying to make peace.

          ZED
          Boys, boys! You're brothers!
          Let's just relax and--
          Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight
          is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and
          wrestle each other to the ground.

          OH
          Shouldn't we do something?

          ZED
          Just let them settle it.
          Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head
          with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and
          lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing
          hard.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)

          (SHOCKED)
          I guess that settles it.

          CAIN
          (turns on him sharply,
          still holding the bloody

          ROCK)
          What?!

          ZED
          Nothing!
          Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.

          CAIN
          He's all right. Probably just

          him-- keep him warm 'til he wakes
          up.
          He starts kicking dirt over Abel's body.

          This is bad. This is really bad.
          We're in serious trouble.

          ZED
          Hey! What do you mean "we"? I
          don't want to play the blame game,
          but you're the one who hit him.

          CAIN
          (turns on them)
          You could've stopped me! There's
          two of you and only one of me.

          ZED
          We didn't know you were going to
          kill him--

          CAIN
          You calling me a murderer?
          (he clutches the rock)

          ZED
          Did I say that?

          CAIN
          It was an accident!
          (to Oh)
          Right?

          OH
          Right! You were holding the rock
          and he-- accidentally ran into it--
          really hard-- with his head.

          CAIN
          (calming down)
          Okay-- yeah-- good. But it might
          be better if we don't mention the
          "accident" to anyone. People might
          get the wrong idea. Understand?

          OH
          Oh, yeah, people could so easily
          misinterpret that.

          Why don't you come with me? Have

          Unfortunately we already have

          Cain finishes loading bushels of grain onto an oxcart while
          Zed and Oh closely inspect the big, heavy, solid wooden
          wheels on the cart.

          ZED
          What are the big round things for?

          CAIN
          They're wheels, numbskull. They
          make the cart roll.

          Wow! That is like the greatest

          THE CART
          with them riding on it, plodding slowly into a FARMING
          HAMLET,Â°a cluster of small, roughly plastered mud houses with
          thatched roofs.
          ADAM, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but still strong
          and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his
          shoulder. He could be Max Von Sydow.

          ADAM
          (hailing Cain)
          Cain, my son!

          CAIN
          Hail, Father.
          Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh.
          CAIN                                                             (cont'd)
          Can these guys stay for supper?
          (off Adam's questioning

          LOOK)
          I bring strangers who would sojourn
          with us this night.
          Cain turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip-
          sewing gesture, ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper.

          ADAM
          Greetings, strangers. I am called
          Adam and you are welcome to share
          the fruits of our toil.

          ZED
          Thanks, but I'm kind of staying
          away from fruit for the time being.
          Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them
          into his crude dwelling.

          The rude dwelling has a stark, somber, almost Amish feeling
          to it. Zed and Oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal       youngest
          with Adam, Cain and his
          Adam's wife EVE and h
          them, Lilith's tunic gaping open to reveal her breasts every
          time she leans over to put something on the table. Zed and
          Oh can't take their eyes off her.

          ADAM
          (to Cain)
          Where is thy brother, Abel?

          CAIN
          (badly overplaying)
          Abel? Haven't seen him. I thought
          he was with you.
          (to Zed and Oh)
          You guys see him?
          They shake their heads and cough nervously.

          ZED AND OH
          (equally unconvincing)
          Nape. Not that I remember. Never
          seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime --
          ever.

          ADAM
          (to Cain)
          Your sister Lilith said she saw him
          in the field with you.

          CAIN
          I think that was yesterday.

          ADAM
          No, this day. She said you both
          made offerings.

          CAIN
          That might've been Boaz---

          ADAM
          No, you and Abel. She said it
          looked like you were arguing.

          CAIN
          Hey, we're brothers, we argue
          sometimes- it's not that big a
          deal.

          Okay! What am I-- his keeper? Get
          off my back, will you?
          He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An
          awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks.

          ADAM
          I fear the worst for Abel. I am
          sorely vexed.

          ZED
          Yeah, that's got to be pretty
          vexing.
          A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly
          on his sorry circumstances.

          ADAM
          For my sin the ground is cursed.
          Thorns and thistles does it sprout
          for us, and we are doomed to toil
          all the days of our lives. For as
          the Lord has commanded, by the
          sweat of your brow shall you get
          bread to eat until you return to
          the ground from which you were
          taken. For dust you are, and to
          dust shall you return.

          ZED
          Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't
          it?

          ADAM
          It's the way of the world.

          ZED
          Boy, I hope not.

          ADAM
          (rises abruptly)
          You are welcome to stay the night
          and lay with my daughter Lilith.
          Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at Adam.

          ZED
          I'm waiting for the punchline.

          ADAM
          She is without a husband, and as
          the Lord has said, thou shalt be
          fruitful and multiply.
          Lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain. Zed starts
          to follow her out.

          OH
          Hey! What about me?

          ADAM
          You may share the bed of my son
          Seth.

          ZED
          Yeah, there you go.
          (he exits)
          Oh looks at Seth.

          SETH
          I multiplied with a sheep.

          My thingie smells like lamb chops.

          Zed enters the room. Lilith reclines on a cot with a straw
          mattress.

          LILITH
          (making room on the cot)
          My bed is small but you're welcome
          to share it. It's the way of my
          people.

          ZED
          (lying down beside her)
          And that's a good way to be. In
          fact, I'm kind of surprised a
          pretty girl like you is sleeping
          alone anyway. I would've thought
          guys would be lined up at the door.

          LILITH
          I don't like men.

          ZED
          (moving closer)
          Maybe you just haven't met the
          right one.

          So we have that in common--

          LILITH
          (stares at him for a beat)
          I'm attracted to women.

          ZED
          (a beat)
          I don't even know what that means.
          What does that mean?

          LILITH
          I like to have sex with other
          women.

          ZED
          (stares at her for a long

          MOMENT)
          I'm really not getting this.
          Lilith shakes her head, turns away from him, and pulls up her
          blanket. Zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep. They lie there
          quietly in the dark for a long beat. Then--
          Zed                                                             (cont'd)

          Oh is lying next to Seth, wide-awake, trying to stay as far
          away from him as possible.

          SETH
          Oooh, listen to this one.
          Seth lifts his knees to his chest and farts a surprisingly
          long cadenza.

          In the yard behind the house, Oh is helping Cain as he chops
          firewood with a metal axe. Oh now wears a tunic like the
          farmers.

          He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's
          benefit.

          You're not coming?

          ZED
          Why would they blame us?

          going to start pointing fingers,

          Adam and the other farmers discover Abel's body.

          (BITTERLY)

          CAIN--

          22
          Adam and the other farmers jump onto two more oxcarts and set
          out after Cain, Zed and Oh.

          CUT TO:

          Cain's cart lumbers along. He looks back over his shoulder.

          CAIN
          (urgently, to Zed and Oh)
          They're gaining on us!
          Zed and Oh look back.

          THEIR POV
          The other oxcarts are a hundred yards back, "chasing" them at
          maybe two miles per hour.
          Cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to 3 MPH.

          CAIN

          (GLEEFUL)
          Hah! They'll never catch us now!
          An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his
          pursuers.
          Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and
          strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into
          the cart. He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged
          burn mark on his forehead.

          The ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the
          seacoast, a kind of makeshift tent city around a central
          marketplace. Several dhows are tied up at the shore, camels
          and pack animals are tethered on the fringes, while TRADERS
          and MERCHANTS inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over
          prices.

          25                                                              EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY - LATER   25

          Zed, Oh and Cain wander through the crowded market. PEOPLE
          OF EVERY RACE dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy, sell,
          and barter goods from distant lands. Zed and oh gawk like a
          couple of yokels.

          ZED
          Look at all these people! And this
          stuff!
          Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the
          bread.

          OH
          (to the Merchant)
          Can I have one of those?
          He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with
          a cane.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)

          Two silver pieces.

          CAIN

          (HUNGRY)
          We're gonna need some money.

          ZED
          Yeah, we're gonna need money.
          (an afterthought)
          What's money?
          They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around
          a raised platform.
          SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform
          while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned.
          The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a
          loincloth.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          It's Marlak!
          Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain
          attached to a thick leather collar around his neck.

          AUCTIONEER
          (addresses the crowd)
          Next up, an unusual item-- looks
          like a Caucasian-- he's big, he's
          strong, he's a good breeder, so I'm
          going to start at                                               100        gold minas.
          Do I hear                                                       100?
          As the bidding starts, Zed spots Maya, his sister Eema, and
          Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves waiting to be sold.
          Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go to them.

          ZED
          (amazed to see them)
          Eema! Maya!
          The women embrace him with relief and excitement.

          OH

          (SHEEPISH)
          Hi, Eema.

          EEMA
          Oh.

          ZED
          What happened? How did you get
          here?

          MAYA
          Well, after the fire--
          (she shoots him an
          accusing look))
          --the hill tribes raided the
          village. The men fought them but
          they were too many. They took us
          captive, marched us to the sea,
          then traded us to the boat people
          who brought us here.

          OH
          (to Eema)
          Are you all right? Did they-- rape
          you?

          EEMA

          (SHRUGS)
          Just a little.
          Zed and Oh look at her curiously.
          The SLAVE TRADER sees them talking to Eema and approaches.

          SLAVE TRADER
          You interested in some slaves?

          ZED
          (like a prospective buyer)
          Yeah, this one looks pretty good--
          He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's
          buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's
          breasts. She punches him.
          Zed                                                             (cont'd)
          Ooh, feisty! So how does this work
          if we want them?
          The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes.

          SLAVE TRADER
          You have money?

          ZED

          (CAGEY)
          Well, that depends on what you mean
          by money?

          SLAVE TRADER
          Look, pal, money talks and bullshit
          walks. I don't have time for looky-
          loos.

          Cain steps up and intercedes.

          CAIN

          (GRANDLY)
          Perhaps I can help.
          (confidentially to Zed and

          OH)
          Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I
          can make a deal with him. You guys
          wait here.
          Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and
          walks him away.
          CAIN                                                        (cont'd)
          (to the slave trader)
          So what are we lookin' at here?
          From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't
          hear what they're saying.

          OH
          (to Eema)
          What an amazing coincidence--
          running into you and Maya and them.

          ZED
          You still think it's all just a
          coincidence?                                                All of us here right
          now, at this particular place, at
          this particular time?

          OH

          (THINKS)
          I don't know. Why do you think?

          ZED
          I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting
          to believe that everything happens
          for a reason. Like, why did I eat
          the forbidden fruit?

          OH
          To get laid?

          MAYA
          Hey!

          Official White                                   44.
          Okay, that might have been what I
          was thinking at the time, but what
          if some omnipotent force put the
          fruit there because I was supposed
          to eat it?

          OH
          which omnipotent force?

          ZED
          What do you mean "which" omnipotent
          force? How many omnipotent forces
          could there be?

          OH
          I don't know! What's "omnipotent"
          mean?

          ZED
          Work with me-- I'm just speculating
          here. Let's call this force "God";
          and let's say this "God" is
          controlling everything. Maybe God
          wanted me to have the knowledge of
          good and evil.

          OH
          Why would he want that?

          MAYA
          How do you know God's a "He?"
          Zed rolls his eyes.

          ZED
          Don't you get what I'm saying?
          What if we've been chosen?

          MAYA
          You think we've been chosen by God?

          ZED
          Well, no offense, but it's possible
          that I was chosen and you all just
          happened to be there.

          OH
          Why would God choose you? Why
          wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's
          stronger.

          A chosen doesn't need to be strong.
          I'm big this way.
          (points to his temples)

          OH
          You do have a fat face.

          ZED
          Not my face, my brain. It's
          enormous. I'm the smartest guy in
          the village.

          OH

          (SCOFFS)
          You're not even-- I'm smarter than
          you!

          ZED
          What?!
          (to ANOTHER VILLAGER)
          Which one of us is smarter?

          VILLAGER
          You're both idiots!

          ZED
          Oh yeah, then why are we free and
          you're chained up?

          VILLAGER
          Because of you?

          CAIN
          (calls them over)
          Hey! Come here. I think we worked
          something out.

          ZED
          (confidently, to Maya)
          Sit tight. I'm going to get you
          out of here. Do you trust me?

          (HEDGING)
          I want to trust you.

          ZED
          Fair enough.
          She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to
          Cain and the slave trader.

          Zed and Oh are dragged onto the platform in shackles and leg
          irons.
          They see Cain riding off on a donkey. He holds up a bag of
          coins and waves goodbye.

          Why? Just 'cause he murdered his
          brother and got hit by lightning?
          They are pushed to the front of the platform.

          SLAVE TRADER
          (to the crowd)
          All right! Next up is a twofer--
          I'm selling them as a pair-- I know
          they don't look like much-- but I'm
          starting the bidding at sixty gold
          minas. Do I hear sixty?

          (NOTHING)
          Remember, it's two for one here.
          Do I hear fifty? Anyone? That's
          only twenty-five apiece, folks.

          (NOTHING)
          Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended.
          SLAVE TRADER (cont'd)
          You're breaking my heart here. How
          about forty? Do I hear forty?

          (NOTHING)

          ZED
          (to Oh)
          It's not like I want to be a slave
          or anything, but this is
          embarrassing!

          They probably don't know how smart
          you think you are.
          Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk
          and waves it at the slave trader.

          SLAVE TRADER
          Yes! Sold to Sheikh Hassan for                                  30
          gold minas!

          A small CARAVAN OF CAMELS AND DONKEYS loaded with trade goods
          moves across the arid wasteland. The effete SHEIKH rides the
          lead camel, protected from the blistering sun by a colorful
          canopy. A FEW ARMED BEDOUIN GUARDS ride alongside.
          Bringing up the rear is A LARGE FOUR-WHEELED CART DRAWN BY
          HORSES, basically a cage on wheels into which TWENTY NEWLY
          PURCHASED SLAVES have been crammed, jammed together like
          sardines.
          Zed and Oh are in the middle of the body pile, literally
          cheek by jowl with the other slaves, barely able to move.       I
          Eema is right next to Oh, her body pressed tight against his.
          Oh shifts around, repositioning his arms and body trying to
          get more comfortable and give Eema a little space, but he
          just ends up touching her even more.

          OH

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Excuse me-- I'm sorry--
          (his hand gets stuck
          between her breasts)
          That's not good--
          He jerks his hand away, elbowing Marlak in the face.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             48.
          Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle
          forces everyone else to shift which causes even more
          discomfort.

          THE OTHER SLAVES
          Ow! Hey! Cut that out!
          Zed tries to turn his head to see who's behind him.

          ZED                                                             (CONT'D)

          (GROUCHY)
          Hey, pal! You can take your foot
          out of my ass anytime now.

          (BEAT)
          And your foot is still there. If I
          turn around, you will be sorry.
          Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him
          face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          That's better.

          MAYA
          For you maybe.

          ZED
          Look, I want you to know I blame
          myself for everything that
          happened.

          MAYA
          So does everybody else.

          MARLAK
          (over his shoulder)
          Get away from my woman!

          ZED

          (IRRITATED)
          I don't think that's going to be
          possible. And I told you before,
          she's not "your woman."

          MARLAK
          I'll kill you!
          Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body
          pile trying to get to Zed.

          THE OTHER SLAVES
          Hey! Watch it, jerk!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                                    49.
          It's too cramped to even throw a punch, so Marlak uses a
          RANDOM SLAVE'S HEAD as a weapon to bang against zed's head
          repeatedly.

          RANDOM SLAVE

          (MEEKLY)
          Why?
          Suddenly Zed feels Marlak's hands around his neck, grabbing
          him from behind. Zed struggles but Marlak manages to pull
          him into a full headlock, forcing Zed's face into his hairy
          armpit.

          ZED

          (MUFFLED)
          Ecchhh!
          Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can't move.

          OH
          (calling to Zed)
          Hold on! I'm coming!
          Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch.
          OH                                                            (CONT'D)                                            (cont'd)
          If everyone could just move to the
          right. Please? Thank you in
          advance for your cooperation.
          (then, giving up hope)
          You can do it, Zed! Use his weight
          against him!
                                                                        Marlak now has Zed locked in a lethal choke hold.

                                                                                                                            28

          28                                                            EXT. THE SLAVE WAGON - CONTINUOUS

          A BEDOUIN GUARD notices the commotion and bangs the bars of
          the cage with his staff.

          BEDOUIN
          (shouts at the slaves)
          Knock it off! Don't make me come
          in there!

          ZED

          (MASHED)
          I'd like to see you try.
          The Bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly A METAL
          TIPPED ARROW FLIES IN AND PIERCES HIS THROAT. He drops to
          the sand, dead.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                    50.

          A BATTLE CHARIOT
          comes flying over the crest of the wadi followed by TWENTY
          ARMORED FOOT SOLDIERS wearing bronze helmets and
          breastplates.
          The soldiers attack the caravan, slashing and slicing the
          Bedouin guards.
          Their commander, SARGON, his helmet topped with a magnificent
          plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of
          his sword cuts the head off ANOTHER BEDOUIN GUARD.
          Marlak reaches through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin's
          sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon.
          The door flies open and the slaves tumble, jump and stumble
          out onto the ground.
          Zed and Oh look around, gawking at the massacre taking place.
          Then Zed sees Marlak, sword in hand, looking for him.

          SARGON
          (shouts an order)
          Take the slaves!
          Marlak starts for Zed but two soldiers ride up and throw a
          heavy restraining net over him.
          Zed grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand
          dune.
          Sargon watches them flee.

          A SOLDIER
          Sir, shall I pursue them?

          SARGON
          No. Let the desert have them.
          They won't get far.

          CUT TO:

          29                                                              EXT. THE DESERT   - SUNSET   29

          The soldiers are camped for the night. The slaves are back
          in their cage. Sargon the commander stops to instruct the

          GUARD.

          SARGON
          Tend to the slaves. We leave for
          Sodom before daybreak.

          GUARD
          Yes, sir.

          30

          30                                                           ZED AND OH
          They lie hidden behind a sandy ridge watching from a short
          distance.

          ZED

          (WHISPERS)
          I wonder who they are. Their hats
          are really great, aren't they?

          OH
          Their hats? I'm sorry, but when
          that one guy cut the other guy's
          head off, my first thought wasn't,
          "Gee, what a great hat."

          ZED
          It wasn't my very first thought,
          but I'd be lying if I said it
          wasn't up there.

          (WATCHFUL)
          Now we just need to figure out a
          way to rescue Maya and Eema.

          OH
          How are we going to rescue anybody?
          They're killers!

          ZED

          (WILY)
          Patience, my friend. Even killers
          have to sleep sometime.
          He keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          31                                                           THE MORNING SUN   31
          Zed and Oh fast asleep on the ridge. They slowly wake up.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                              52.

          ZED

          (SCRATCHING)
          Well, that was refreshing. How'd
          you sleep?

          OH

          (YAWNS)
          Not that well. I think I was over-
          tired.
          Then Zed suddenly remembers Maya. He looks and sees that the
          soldiers and slaves are long gone.

          ZED
          Shit!
          He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees
          nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction.

          OH
          Now where do we go?
          Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes
          the sand.

          ZED
          I have no idea.

          CUT TO:

          32                                                             ZED AND OH   32
          trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing
          weaker, stumbling and falling.

          OH
          (too weak to move)
          Why do I listen to you? Now we're
          going to starve to death or die of
          thirst.

          ZED
          Will you stop being so negative? I
          got your back, man. Who saved you
          from those lions when you were a
          baby? They were going to pounce,
          had you surrounded. Took the mama
          lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in
          the face. Papa lion comes flying
          at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow,
          knocked his ass out.

          Took his legs-- THWOOM!-- tossed
          him in the river. And the rest
          just ran off.

          OH
          You know, I've asked people about
          that and no one else seems to
          remember it.

          ZED
          Yeah, because nobody else was
          there. You're lucky I was walking
          by.

          (THEN)
          Okay, it's possible I dreamed that--
          but who practically raised you
          after your father was dragged off
          by those raccoons? Not a dignified
          death.

          OH
          (practically delirious)
          He was a small man.
          Oh collapses face down in the sand.
          Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry
          jackals, vultures and hyenas.

          ZED
          We've got to keep moving.
          (hauls Oh to his feet)
          I've got you, buddy-- just like
          always.
          He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on.

          33                                                              EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - LATER   33

          A MAN in his sixties, tall, full beard, piercing eyes and
          fierce nose, dressed in a robe and kafiyya, arranges firewood
          on a large flat rock. His TEENAGE SON looks around
          curiously. They are ABRAHAM and ISAAC.

          ISAAC
          Hey, Dad? We making a burnt
          offering?

          ABRAHAM
          Yes, Isaac. As God has commanded
          me.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             54.

          ISAAC

          (CONFUSED)
          I don't see the sheep.

          ABRAHAM
          The Lord will provide the sheep.
          Abraham takes a cord and starts tying Isaac's hands together.

          ISAAC

          (NERVOUSLY)
          Uh-- is this like a magic trick?
          Without another word Abraham takes strong hold of Isaac and
          lifts him up onto the firewood.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)
          (really scared now)
          Okay, if this is because I didn't
          clean up my tent, you can stop now.
          I get it.
          Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his
          robe.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)

          (PANICKED)
          All right, this isn't funny
          anymore!
          Abraham raises the knife.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)
          I'm telling mom!
          The knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy.

          ZED                                                             (O.C.)

          STOP!
          Abraham and Isaac both turn to see Zed and Oh step out from
          behind the rocks. Their clothes are tattered and they are
          burnt raw by the sun.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          What are you doing to that kid?

          ABRAHAM

          (INNOCENTLY)
          Nothing.

          ZED
          What do you mean, nothing? You
          were just going to kill him!

          ABRAHAM
          No, I was going to sacrifice him.
          There's a difference.

          ZED
          (indicating Isaac)
          Not to him, I'm guessing.
          Isaac nods gratefully.

          ABRAHAM
          By what right do you interfere?
          Art thou an angel of the Lord?

          ZED
          (good question)
          What do you think?

          ABRAHAM
          (nods sagely)
          Verily, thou wast sent to stay my
          hand by the Eternal one, blessed be
          He.

          ZED

          (NODS)
          Whatever you just said.
          Oh helps Isaac off the altar stone and unties him.

          ISAAC
          (confidentially to Oh)
          He's nuts! I'm telling you-- he's
          totally lost it.

          ABRAHAM
          (to Zed)
          I am Abraham, son of Terah of the
          house of Nahor.

          ZED
          I am Zed and this is Oh, sons of--

          ABRAHAM
          The tents of my kinsmen lie just
          beyond. There will you find all
          that you desire. Come.

          Abraham leads Isaac, Zed and Oh past the colorful               tents of
          his people. The camp is alive with activity.

          The spacious tent is lit by torches, and a feast is in
          progress. TWENTY OR THIRTY BEARDED MEN in skullcaps and long
          robes lounge on cushions or sit cross-legged in a circle on
          the carpeted floor.
          An EGYPTIAN BELLY DANCER shakes her hips for the pleasure of
          Abraham who occupies the place of honor.
          Zed and oh, now also wearing robes and skullcaps, are sitting
          right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight.
          Isaac sits beside them.
          ABRAHAM claps his hands for attention. Zed and Oh look up as
          the music stops.

          ABRAHAM
          (to the assembly)
          My brothers, let us give thanks
          unto God for staying my hand on the
          mountain this day.

          ISAAC
          (humoring him)
          Best dad in all the land, everyone!

          THE KINSMEN
          (a ritual response, in

          UNISON)
          Praise be to God, hallowed be His
          name.

          ABRAHAM
          And for the bounty which He hath
          bestowed unto us.

          THE KINSMEN
          (in unison)
          He hath increased our wealth and
          blessed us with His loving
          kindness.
          Zed and Oh mutter along, trying to fit in.

          ZED AND OH
          (a beat late)
          --mumble mumble mumble loving
          kindness.
          Abraham looks at them.

          ABRAHAM
          Friends, whence comest thou?
          Zed and Oh look at each other blankly.

          ISAAC

          (HELPFULLY)
          He wants to know where you're from.

          ABRAHAM

          (SUSPICIOUS)
          Thou comest not from the cities of
          the plain? From Sodom or Gomorrah?
          Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the
          destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others.

          ZED
          Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been
          there. But I've heard of them.

          OH
          Are they nice?

          ABRAHAM
          The Lord has cursed them for their
          abomination.

          ZED
          (nods gravely)
          i didn't know that. What kind of
          abomination are we talking about?

          ABRAHAM
          They bow down before false Gods and
          worship graven images.

          ZED
          (clicks his tongue)
          Abominable.

          ABRAHAM
          The men of the city are weak and
          soft, fat with rich food,
          intoxicated by strong drink.

          ZED
          (sounds good to him)
          Really. Tell me more.

          ABRAHAM
          Their women are whores; their
          shameless lust knows no bounds.
          They flaunt their flesh without
          shame and any man may have
          knowledge of them.

          OH
          (he's sold)
          And where exactly are those cities?

          ZED
          (off Abraham's stern look)
          We just want to know so we can
          avoid them.

          ABRAHAM

          (FIERCELY)
          Walk not the path of Sodom! For
          surely will the Lord send his holy
          fire to destroy the city and all
          who dwell within, to smite them and
          all their seed for their iniquity.

          ZED

          (CONCERNED)
          When do you think all this smiting
          is going to go down? We may have
          some friends there.

          ABRAHAM
          (getting up)
          Accompany me.
          Abraham sweeps out of the tent. Zed and Oh jump to their
          feet and follow. Isaac tags along.

          Abraham walks to the edge of the desert. Torchlight from the
          camp flickers on his face as he gazes across the desolate
          moonlit landscape.

          ZED
          Abraham, I'm a little worried about
          the city being destroyed.

          ABRAHAM
          Their fate is sealed. But for my
          faith and devotion, the self-same
          God has given unto me the whole of
          this land, from the Jordan to the
          Negev, from the river of Egypt to
          the great Euphrates. This did He
          grant to me and my seed.
          He raises his arms and spreads them wide.

          ZED

          (IMPRESSED)
          This is all your land?

          ABRAHAM
          For eternity.

          ISAAC

          (SCOFFS)
          Yeah, God just forgot to tell
          anyone else. we're having a war
          with someone like every five
          minutes.

          ABRAHAM
          (scowls at him)
          I and my kinsmen have vanquished
          our enemies by the mighty hand of
          the Lord, praised be He.
          Zed and Oh fake their way through a ritual response.

          ZED
          His name is praise and love his
          whole graciousness--

          OH
          --of his wealthy bounty.
          Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes.

          ABRAHAM
          Therefore, to signify my Covenant
          with the One True God, on this
          night will I circumcise the flesh
          of my foreskin, and of you and
          every male who dwells hereby.

          ZED                                                 OH
          Excuse me?                                          I'm not clear--

          ISAAC
          Here we go again--

          ABRAHAM
          we will grasp the foreskins of our
          penises and cut therefrom the extra
          flesh.

          ZED

          (AGHAST)
          I'm not sure I have any extra.

          OH
          Couldn't we could just get our ears
          pierced?

          ISAAC
          (aside to Zed)
          Okay, what did I tell you-- nuts?

          ZED
          You know, Abe, it's late, and we've
          all had a lot to drink, and I know
          this whole foreskin thing sounds
          like a good idea now, but you may
          just want to sleep on it. we could
          always cut 'em off in the morning,
          but if we do it now, there's just
          no putting it back on later.

          ABRAHAM
          No. So it shall be written, so it
          shall be done.
          (to Isaac)
          Get my big knife.
          Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their crotches.

          CUT TO:

          Zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills. They hear a PAINED
          SCREAM from someone being circumcised back at Abraham's camp.

          OH
          You have any idea where we're
          going?

          ZED
          To the city. I have to find Maya.

          OH
          The city! He said God's going to
          smite them with holy fire!

          ZED
          And you're going to listen to him?
          You think he's more chosen than me?

          OH
          He seemed to know what he was
          talking about.

          ZED
          Yes, and he also wanted to give his
          dick a little trim.

          VOICE                                                           (O.C.)
          Hey, wait up!
          Zed and Oh turn to see Isaac running towards them.

          ISAAC
          (out of breath)
          I'm coming with you.

          ZED
          You don't even know where we're
          going.

          ISAAC
          You're going to Sodom, right?

          ZED
          No. Your dad specifically said
          Sodom and Gomorrah were evil.

          ISAAC
          Yeah, whatever. If I show you how
          to get there, will you buy me a
          bottle of wine?

          ZED
          No! I told you, that's not where
          we're going.

          ISAAC
          Fine. Then we'll just stand here.

          ZED
          Fine.
          They stand there for less than a beat.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom.
          Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points
          off in the distance.

          THEIR POV
          Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set
          atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls.

          ZED
          I knew it was right around here.

          ISAAC
          Me and my friends sneak in on the
          weekends. We hang around, pick up
          on the babes, drink some wine, get
          wasted on killer hash--

          ZED
          You shouldn't be smoking either.

          ISAAC
          Thanks, Grandpa, but I've been
          smoking for four harvests, so I
          think I'm okay.
                                                                          They start down toward the city.

                                                                                                             CUT TO:

          Zed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they
          approach the massive solid wooden gates.

          OH
          Gee, they're not open. We should
          probably come back later.

          ISAAC
          You just have to knock. They
          always let me in.
          (to Oh)
          Go ahead.

          OH
          Me? Why do I have to knock? What
          if we're waking somebody up? Let's
          just get out of here.

          ZED
          Where? Back to the penis-cutter?
          Besides, Eema and Maya might be in
          there. You want to get them out
          before the city's destroyed, don't
          you?
          Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the
          door.

          ISAAC

          (SHOUTING)
          Hey! Anybody there? Hello?
          Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and
          slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly
          runs away.

          SENTRY
          (shouts at him)
          Halt!
          Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the
          guards.

          ISAAC
          You gonna make me?
          (dancing and dodging like
          a boxer)
          You and what army?

          ZED
          (shouts to Isaac)
          Get help! Tell your father!

          Like I'm really gonna tell my
          father I came with you to Sodom.
          So long, suckers!
          He takes off running.

          ZED
          (to Oh)
          I kinda get why his dad wanted to
          kill him.
          The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner
          of the city gates.

          CUT TO:

          The sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw
          them up against the wall. THREE OTHER GUARDS look up at the
          new arrivals.

          FIRST GUARD
          What's this now?

          SENTRY
          They were banging on the gate.
          Hebrews, from the look of them.

          ZED
          We're not really Hebrews--
          The guard smacks him in the mouth.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.

          SENTRY
          Should we wake the Sergeant?

          FIRST GUARD
          You don't want to do that. He gets
          pretty mean when you wake him.

          OH
          Meaner than this?
          The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly.
          The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look
          nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.

          SERGEANT
          (from behind the door,

          ROARS)

          BLOODY HELL! WHAT'S GOING ON OUT

          THERE!
          Zed and Oh exchange worried looks. Then the door flies open
          and the SERGEANT, a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a man,
          fills the door frame.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)

          (glowers at him)
          I thought it was a woman.
          He lumbers over and gets his face very close to Oh's.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)
          You don't look like a woman, but
          maybe you want to kiss me anyway.
          Is that right? You want to kiss
          me?
          Oh turns away from his foul breath.
          The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him
          off the ground.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)
          By morning you'll be sorry you were
          born.

          OH
          Don't have to wait 'til morning.

          ZED
          Hey! Why don't you pick on someone
          your own size?
          The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (quickly backpedaling)
          Which would be difficult since
          there are probably very few people
          around who actually are your size--
          He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                   66.

          SERGEANT
          (to another guard)
          Get my big stick. I'll deal with
          the fat one first.

          ZED

          (INSULTED)
          Relatively fat one. I wouldn't be
          talking about fat, if I were you.
          Another blow from the sergeant.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Right. Enough said.
          The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then
          steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a
          lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes.

          SERGEANT
          (to Zed and Oh)
          Welcome to Sodom.
          As he takes a big backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and
          prepare for the worst.

          VOICE                                                         (O.C.)
          Stop!
          Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the door, dressed like the
          other guards in breastplate and helmet.

          CAIN
          Wait! I know these guys!

          ZED AND OH
          Cain?

          CAIN
          Brothers!!
          He embraces them. They look confused and doubtful, but
          relieved.

          CUT TO:

          Cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets. People
          avoid Cain's gaze and part like the Red Sea to allow him
          through.

          CAIN
          You know, you guys are lucky that
          sergeant is a friend of mine. I
          let him sodomize me once right
          after I got here and he's been real
          nice to me ever since.

          OH

          (SARCASTIC)
          Yeah, thanks for saving us. What
          are you going to do to us now?
          Cain stops and looks at them.

          CAIN
          wait a second. Do I detect a tone
          here?

          ZED
          All right, honestly? You did sell
          us into slavery.

          CAIN
          (instantly offended)
          Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge
          much? That was like a fortnight
          ago.

          ZED
          That was way less than a fortnight.
          Half a fortnight, maybe.

          CAIN
          Give me a break! I was dealing
          with the death of a close family
          member and I needed some space.
          But now I realize that you guys are
          like my brothers. And it's so rare
          to find a brother that you love.
          Right?
          He embraces them.

          ZED AND OH

          (UNEASILY)
          Right.

          CAIN

          (EXUBERANT)
          Now, you guys hungry? Watch this.
          Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly
          at the VENDOR. He raises his fist. The vendor cowers.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             68.
          CAIN                                                            (CONT'D)   (cont'd)
          (to Vendor)
          That's two for flinching.
          Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          That's the kind of love I'm talkin'
          about.
          As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute
          lounging in a doorway.

          ZED
          Check out that woman across the
          street! She's looking at us.
          The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a
          banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.

          OH
          We are so in! She's eye-knowing us
          like crazy.

          CAIN
          You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me.
          It's crazy. This morning, I almost
          got a handie behind that pita
          stand.

          OH
          Well, I kind of have a girlfriend--
          not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I
          like, so I shouldn't--

          CAIN
          Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays
          in Sodom.
          He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT.
          The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          You know, if you guys are staying
          you should join the guards. The
          pay's not great, but there's tons
          of perks. I'm telling you, it's
          the only way to go.
          Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it
          in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the
          ass and she runs away.

          OH
          (to the child)
          Sorry.

          CAIN
          Come on, I'll introduce you to the
          captain.

          CUT TO:

          41                                                              EXT. BARRACKS       - NEXT MORNING   41

          A military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the
          garrison. GUARDSMEN come double-timing out of the barracks
          and hurry to line up in formation.
          Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door
          now dressed as Royal Guards. Zed actually looks dashing, but
          Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping
          down over his eyes.

          ZED
          This is great! How do I look?

          OH
          You look good, but I think my hat's
          too big.
          They notice an OFFICER staring at them.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          (to the officer)
          Do you happen to know where I could
          get a smaller hat?
          The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon.

          OFFICER

          (ROARS)
          Line up!
          Zed and Oh hustle into line, orders are shouted and the troop
          marches off.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          42                                                              EXT. CITY STREETS   - LATER          42

          Zed and Oh are on patrol with Cain in the heart of the city.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                            70.

          ZED
          So is this it? We just walk
          around?

          CAIN
          Pretty much. We just look for
          troublemakers and kick the living
          shit out of 'em.

          ZED
          What kind of trouble?

          CAIN
          If we see a thief or a pickpocket,
          we just slap him around-- maybe cut
          off a finger or an ear, or the tip
          of his nose, lower lip-- anything
          you can just grab and slice in one
          fluid motion-- then we take our
          share of the loot and let him go.
          Mostly what we worry about are
          activist types, rabble rousers,
          getting people all riled up against
          the King or the Temple Priests.
          That's death for sure.

          ZED
          Pretty harsh, isn't it?

          CAIN
          Harsh times, brother. We're in the
          middle of a famine. People are
          starving. If we don't get some
          rain soon, it could get ugly.
          (looking forward to it)
          Then we'll get to start kicking ass
          big time.
          He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out.
          CAIN                                           (cont'd)
          Beat it, you filthy beggar!

          OH
          You can't blame people for being
          hungry.

          CAIN
          Yeah, well, just remember, it's the
          palace that pays you, not the
          people.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             71.
          Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets
          and turn to look.
          At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE
          falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to
          the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the
          ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches.
          Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed
          just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only
          one standing.
          EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an
          ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it
          is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly
          dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red
          lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big
          ostrich plume fan.
          Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty.
          Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice
          he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives
          him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously.
          As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at
          Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now
          elaborately costumed and made-up.
          Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks
          him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the
          entourage passes.

          ZED
          (on the ground, excitedly
          to Oh)
          Did you see that girl? I think she
          liked me! She looked right at me.

          OH
          Gee, I wonder why?
          The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all
          get back to their feet.

          ZED
          Who was she?

          CAIN
          The Princess Inanna. She's totally
          hot, but don't even think about it.

          ZED
          Why not?

          CAIN
          Because she's royalty and you're
          scum?
          The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the
          royal entourage.

          OH
          Where's everybody going?

          CAIN
          To the temple. Let's go.
          (starts walking)
          You have to see this.

          ZED

          (FOLLOWING)
          Will she be there?

          CAIN
          Everybody will be there.

          At the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned
          with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods.
          Before it is a great altar in front of a HUGE STONE IDOL.
          The idol's mouth is a gaping fiery furnace. Behind the
          temple, is a towering ZIGGURAT still under construction.
          A HUNDRED TRUMPETERS AND DRUMMERS blast a solemn fanfare as
          ORNATELY GARBED PRIESTS ceremoniously climb the stairs to the
          altar.

          ZED AND OH
          stare at the spectacle.

          The Princess Inanna takes her seat near the KING, the QUEEN,
          the MINISTERS and other NOBLES. Maya stands behind the
          Princess and continues fanning her.
          Zed spots the Princess on the pavilion.

          He starts edging toward the royal pavilion.

          Under a broad awning, the King and Queen snack from a table
          covered with platters of exotic fruits and sweetmeats.
          The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes
          his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna.

          KING
          The Princess isn't eating?

          INANNA
          I find it hard to eat when so many
          are hungry.

          KING
          (as if )
          Your concern is enviable.

          INANNA

          (POUTY)
          And besides, I'm so fat.
          The Queen,                                                    40's, still beautiful, reacts.

          QUEEN
          (for the hundredth time)
          You're not fat--

          INANNA
          Yes, I am, mother! Those new linen
          pants you got me from Egypt make my
          ass look just huge.

          QUEEN
          Well, you can't keep starving
          yourself.

          INANNA
          Why not? Everybody else is
          starving-- present company
          excluded.

          KING
          Careful, Princess. You may be my
          step-daughter, but these are
          dangerous times and those are
          dangerous words. I weep for the
          suffering of my people, but the
          spirit of rebellion is alive in the
          city and if necessary I will crush
          it with every means at my disposal.

          INANNA

          (SARCASTIC)
          For the good of the people.

          KING
          (warning her)
          For the good of everyone who enjoys
          the favor of the throne.

          INANNA
          Whatever. I'm just so incredibly
          bored.

          46                                                             THE TEMPLE DOORS   46
          The fanfare climaxes as the great temple doors slowly open
          and the HIGH PRIEST emerges followed by a retinue of
          PRIESTESSES and a dozen VESTAL VIRGINS. They walk in solemn
          silence to ritual positions around the altar.
          The High Priest is even more elaborately costumed than the
          nobles, ridiculously so, standing very tall on high platform
          shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and beard even oilier
          than the others. He turns to the altar, raises his hands to
          the heavens and begins his invocation.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (intoning pompously)
          O El, lord of Heaven and Earth;
          Baal, the Sublime; Shapash, goddess
          of the sun; Hadad, the storm god,
          over-ruling son of Dagon, the
          bountiful, god of grain, our
          earthly sustenance--

          ZED
          He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion
          and stares up at the Princess Inanna.
          She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.

          

          

          

          
          Official white                                                           75.

          INANNA
          Isn't that the idiot who was
          standing up in the street?
          Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming.
          The High Priest continues.

          HIGH PRIEST
          We come before you in humble
          supplication, invoking your
          blessing, the sweet rain which
          waters our fields, enriches the
          harvest, fills our storehouses,
          makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi-
          baal and the city of Sodom--
          The King nods graciously.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd)
          --and feeds us, your children, with
          the bounty of your grace.

          PRINCESS INANNA
          She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile
          crosses her lips.
          Zed grins back at her.
          The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and
          subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring
          at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too
          vigorously.

          THE ALTAR

          HIGH PRIEST
          Accept now this humble sacrifice to
          the power and glory of your
          magnificence.
          He starts inspecting the Vestal Virgins, beautiful young
          women in diaphanous, almost transparent white gowns.

          ZED AND OH
          have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO

          HIM.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                            76.

          ZED
          What's happening?

          GUY
          He's picking a virgin.

          CAIN

          (LASCIVIOUS)
          Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh.

          AT THE ALTAR
          the High Priest is moving down the line of beautiful young
          maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems so obviously
          not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the
          line.

          ZED AND OH
          watching curiously.

          ZED
          What do they want a virgin for?

          GUY
          To throw into the fire.

          ZED

          (SHOCKED)
          Why?

          GUY
          (like talking to an idiot)
          Offering to the Gods. There's a
          famine going on. If we don't make
          a good sacrifice, it won't rain.
          No rain, no harvest. No harvest,
          no food. Get it?

          CAIN
          It's pretty self-explanatory.

          OH
          You throw the virgin in the fire so
          it'll rain?

          GUY
          Duh.

          ZED
          Seems like a waste of a perfectly
          good virgin to me.

          

          

          

          
          Official white                                                             77.

          OH

          (CONCERNED)
          These virgins-- it's always a girl,
          right?

          AT THE ALTAR
          A great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen. She swoons as the
          priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her
          to the fiery mouth of the furnace.

          HIGH PRIEST
          For the love of the Gods and the
          glory of their Creation, the great
          dome of Heaven, the green growing
          Earth, we commit this maiden to
          your Holy Fire.
          Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the
          fire.

          ZED

          (APPALLED)
          This is just crazy.
          Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize
          her.

          MAYA
          (eyes downcast)
          The Princess wishes to see you.

          CAIN
          (staring at her cleavage)
          Her wish is my command.

          MAYA
          Not you. Him.
          (points at Zed)

          ZED
          Me? Cool.
          (then, motioning to Oh)
          We're kind of a package deal. Can
          he come with?

          CAIN
          The three of us are inseparable.
          We're like brothers.
          Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an
          artificial smile.

          Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh.

          MAYA
          The two of you follow me.

          ZED
          (to Cain)
          I'll try to put in a good word for
          you.

          A SQUAD OF SENTRIES stands guard at the massive iron palace
          gates. A CROWD OF BEGGARS is pressed against the gate
          pleading for food. Zed and Oh approach led by Maya. The
          guards brutally push the beggars aside and they enter.

          Maya leads Zed and Oh through the gate and into a beautiful
          atrium where they are met by a fat bald EUNUCH wearing the
          royal livery.

          MAYA
          (to Oh)
          This is Zaftig the Eunuch. You go
          with him.
          Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the
          opposite direction.

          OH
          Can't I go with him?

          EUNUCH
          Why? Is he your lover?

          OH
          (laughs at the thought)
          Hah! No? That would be weird.

          LOVERS--
          The Eunuch just shrugs, apparently not that weird to him.
          OH                                                            (cont'd)

          EUNUCH
          I serve the royal family-- little
          of this, little of that. I've been
          a palace eunuch since I was nine
          years old.

          OH
          You've been living here since you
          were nine?
          (looks around, impressed)
          I should look into that. How do
          you get to be a eunuch?

          EUNUCH

          (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          They cut off your testicles.

          OH

          (HORRIFIED)
          What?! What's up with all the
          genital mutilation?

          EUNUCH

          (SHRUGS)
          Trust me, after a while you don't
          even miss them.

          OH

          (EMPHATIC)
          No, I'd miss them-- I'm sure. I
          hardly got to use them yet.

          INT. PALACE THRONE ROOM - SAME TIME

          The High Priest, an extremely vain, officious, and fussy man,
          still over-dressed in sacramental drag, pushes back his
          sleeves and starts examining the entrails as the King and his
          MINISTERS look on, deeply concerned.

          KING
          Six sacrifices in the last ten days
          and still no rain. What do the
          entrails predict?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (nervously poking at the
          sheep heart)
          Well, the liver is streaked with
          gray-- that's not a favorable sign--
          but the heart looks good. See how
          nice and red it is here. That's
          always a good omen.

          KING
          What does it mean?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Usually it means that the sheep
          took very good care of itself,
          probably sticking to a high-fiber
          diet of grass and hay.

          KING
          What does it mean for us?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Well, it could mean either a
          surprise visit from a former friend
          or sweetheart-- or that you're
          going on a long sea voyage!
          Wouldn't that be fun?

          KING

          (SCORNFUL)
          How did you become High Priest?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Because I'm your brother?

          PRIME MINISTER
          Perhaps it's time for a new High
          Priest.

          HIGH PRIEST

          Perhaps it's not time for a new

          He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister,
          as if wielding the power of the Gods.
          Nothing happens.

          scarce, prices are high, starving
          peasants are pouring into the city
          looking for food--

          It's the will of the Gods.

          divans, listening.

          Can the Gods really be so cruel?

          I don't think that's cruel. It's
          just practical. If everybody was
          rich, who'd wait on us?
          Maya approaches and whispers something to the Princess.

          INANNA
          Good. See that he's bathed and
          dressed, then bring him to me.
          Maya frowns and exits.

          In fact, we came here to find you.

          MAYA
          (not buying it)
          Wait here until you're sent for.

          ZED
          This wasn't my idea, you know.

          MAYA
          Of course not. You were just
          chosen again. Maybe after you and
          the Princess get together you can
          start thinking about someone beside
          yourself.
          She walks off before he can answer.
          Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS
          walking past a row of "LIVING STATUES," semi-nude men and
          women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint,
          frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful
          bodies.
          Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude "GODDESS", then
          furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess
          slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.

          GODDESS
          watch it, jerk!

          ZED
          Hey! You're a real girl! That is
          so cool.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             84.
          He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them,
          mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to
          make them move, but they remain frozen.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Amazing!
          He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one
          is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like
          someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but
          unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round
          shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long,
          shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in
          obvious embarrassment.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (recognizing him)
          Oh?
          Oh looks down from his pedestal.

          OH
          (through clenched teeth)
          I'm not supposed to talk. I'm a
          statue.

          ZED
          Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it
          going?

          OH
          How's it going? I just had my
          whole body painted by a fat guy
          with no balls, and believe me, he
          was very thorough, if you know what
          I mean. How's it going with you?

          ZED
          Not bad. Had a little rub and a
          scrub, now I'm up for some grub.

          OH
          That sounds nice-- for you.

          ZED
          Hey! You'll never guess who's here-
          - Maya! She's working here-- and
          she looks great! But she's kinda
          mad at me.
          Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's
          sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of
          food.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                           85.

          OH
          There's Eema!
          Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a
          household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who
          take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to
          pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.

          SARGON
          Stand still, wench! I want to see
          what's under that skirt.
          As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray of
          food on him. His cohorts laugh.

          EEMA
          I'm sorry! It was an accident.

          SARGON
          That was no accident!
          Sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her.
          Zed steps in quickly.

          ZED
          You! Slave girl!
          (he pulls her away from

          SARGON)
          I told you to fetch me more wine!
          Apologize to this officer--- now!

          EEMA
          I'm sorry.

          ZED
          Now go-- fetch! Wait by that--
          skinny statue. I'll deal with you
          later.
          As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Slaves-- what are you gonna do?

          SARGON
          Try using a hot poker. That they
          understand.

          ZED
          Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep
          that in mind.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                          86.
          Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at
          Oh's pedestal.
          Zed                                                          (cont'd)
          What are you doing here?

          EEMA
          We were sold to the palace. But I
          won't serve these people! I'd
          rather die!

          ZED
          Keep that up and you will.

          EEMA
          What are you doing here?
          (notices his clothes)
          Have you joined them?

          OH
          I haven't joined anything.
          (re the gold body paint)
          Does this look like fun?
          They both look accusingly at Zed.

          ZED
          Okay, I know what you're thinking,
          but I'm just checking it out. We
          kept hearing that this place was so
          evil, but now that I look around
          I'm thinking maybe it's not all
          bad. There's a lot to learn here.

          OH
          What? Like human sacrifice?

          ZED
          No! Like the wheel, for instance!
          That's pretty awesome-- the way it
          just goes around in a circle. And
          farming! And metal-- writing,
          money, pottery-- hot baths. Come
          on! Back in the village we thought
          sharpening a stick was a big
          breakthrough.

          EEMA
          (to Oh)
          What happened to him?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                        87.

          ZED
          Look, I think I've been chosen to
          do something great with my life--

          OH
          Here we go again--

          ZED
          --and I don't think it's hunting
          wild pigs and weaving baskets.
          Maya returns for Zed.

          MAYA

          (COOLLY)
          She wants to see you-- now.

          ZED
          I hope you don't think I'm
          interested in her.

          MAYA

          (MIFFED)
          Why would I think that? Just
          because you couldn't take your eyes
          off her--

          ZED
          I'm just using her, Maya! It's
          part of my plan. I'm going to get
          you all out of here as soon as I
          can.

          MAYA

          (SKEPTICAL)
          What's your plan?

          ZED
          (not a clue)
          It's a secret.

          MAYA
          (not buying it)
          Forget it.
          Maya sees A GUARD watching them and reverts to her slave
          attitude.
          MAYA (cont'd)
          (bowing to Zed)
          The Princess awaits you.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                    88.

          ZED
          And I await her.
          (to Oh and Eema)
          You two await me.
          (then confidentially to
          Eema and Oh)
          Stay out of trouble. I'll be back.
          He exits with Maya.

          EEMA
          He has no idea what he's doing,
          does he?

          OH
          I don't know. So much has
          happened. Sometimes I think--
          She walks away.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          (wistfully, to himself)
          I love you.

          52                                                              THE HIGH PRIEST   52
          Lounging on a divan surrounded by YOUNG MEN. Oh walks by
          still painted gold.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (to Oh)
          You there! Golden boy! Rub me
          with oil.
          The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets
          his rich outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and
          shoulders are incredibly hairy.

          OH
          I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
          I'm not really a slave. I'm a
          guard.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Then maybe you'd rather I speak to
          your commander and have you whipped
          to within an inch of your life. Or
          perhaps I whip you myself? How
          would you like that?

          OH
          Are those my choices?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                           89.

          HIGH PRIEST
          I'd say so.
          The High Priest lies back down. Oh looks around, finds a
          pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the
          High Priest's hairy chest.

          OH
          How's that?

          HIGH PRIEST
          More.

          OH
          (splashes a few more drops
          on him)
          That enough?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (getting angry)
          No! More oil! Much more, you
          insolent dolt!
          Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd)
          That's good. Now rub it in.

          OH

          (APPALLED)
          With my hands?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Do it!
          Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his
          hairy chest and shoulders.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd)
          (in ecstasy)
          Mmmmm, I love it. The sweet scent
          of precious oil. The oily--
          oiliness.
          Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging
          the High Priest. She gasps.

          OH

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Eema! This isn't what you think.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                                 90.

          EEMA

          (FLUSTERED)
          No, it's fine. I understand. This
          really explains a lot about you
          that I didn't get before.

          OH
          No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil
          on this man.
          She exits.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don't
          we go back to my place and see
          what's under all that paint?

          OH

          (DISGUSTED)
          Ughh.

          CUT TO:

          53                                                           INT. PRINCESS'S CHAMBER - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER   53

          Maya ushers Zed into the dimly lit room.

          MAYA
          Good luck.

          ZED

          MAYA--
          She leaves him. A haze of heavily scented incense hangs in
          the air.

          INANNA (O.S.)
          Come to me.
          Zed turns and sees the Princess standing on the terrace.

          54                                                           EXT. GARDEN TERRACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS          54

          Zed steps out onto the moonlit terrace. He crosses to the
          balustrade and stands beside the Princess, gazing out over
          the twinkling cityscape.

          INANNA
          Beautiful, isn't it? You can see
          Gomorrah just over the hill.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                   91.

          ZED
          I didn't know it was so close.

          INANNA
          They're called the "twin cities."

          ZED
          Looks pretty from up here, but some
          people think God is going to wipe
          them out because they're so evil.

          INANNA
          (toying with him)
          And what do you think? Am I evil?

          ZED
          I don't really know you. But you
          don't look evil.

          PRINCESS
          Do you find me attractive?

          ZED
          Well, yeah. I think you're--
          incredible.

          INANNA
          (moving closer)
          I have body issues.

          ZED
          No, you're perfect. Your face,
          your hair--
          (looking into her eyes)
          Your eyes are like the sea.

          INANNA
          (a beat)
          My eyes are brown.

          ZED
          Well, it's kinda dark. I took a
          shot. I know they're big, though--
          and wet--
          She pulls him close.
          ZED                                   (cont'd)
          Can I ask you one thing? What
          would a girl like you want with a
          guy like me?

          

          

          

          
          Official white                                                    92.

          INANNA
          I don't know. I just find you--
          interesting. They say it's the
          will of the gods that some men
          should suffer while others rule--
          that we're all just victims of our
          fate. And I believed that until
          this morning when I saw you
          standing up, alone, in the square.
          And I said to myself, finally
          here's one man who refuses to bow
          down to anything--

          ZED

          UH--
          (considers explaining but
          just lets it go)
          Yeah. That's me.

          INANNA
          Yes, finally a man who has the
          courage to question the order of
          things--- a man chosen by the Gods
          to do something great.

          ZED

          (EXHILARATED)
          That's exactly what I've been
          thinking! You wouldn't believe the
          things that have been happening to
          me lately. I just didn't know why.

          INANNA
          (gets very, very close)
          I know why. To bring you here-- to
          this place-- to me.

          ZED

          I couldn't agree more. I'm trying
          to agree more, but I can't. That's
          how much I agree.

          Come.

          We can see torchlight flickering inside the temple and TWO
          FIGURES moving among the pillars.

          The High Priest is giving Oh a personal tour of the inner
          sanctum. Oh is scrubbed and dressed like a junior priest.

          HIGH PRIEST
          My life is devoted to the service
          of the Gods and the good of the
          people. I take nothing for myself.
          He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every
          finger, and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and
          emeralds.

          OH
          That's so-- unselfish of you.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely.
          Sometimes i hunger for the touch of
          another human being.

          (COY)
          Here's a riddle: what has two
          thumbs and wants another oil rub?
          (pointing thumbs at

          HIMSELF)
          This-guy.
          Ohquickly changes the subject.

          OH
          So where does that hall lead to?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (his eyes light up)
          Come, I'll show you.
          He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of
          incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing
          and arcane religious symbols.

          Behind those doors is the Holy of

          HIGH PRIEST                           (cont'd)
          Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred,
          so powerful, that to enter is
          instant death for any mortal.

          OH
          Wow.
          (a long beat)
          So who cleans it?

          HIGH PRIEST
          it needs no cleaning.

          OH
          No, of course not.
          (can't let go of it)
          Kind of makes you wonder though--
          the guys who built it, did they
          just die the minute they finished,
          or did the Gods give them a second
          to get out?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (starting to get annoyed)
          I assume they finished it, then the
          Gods descended.

          OH
          Yeah, that's probably it.
          (another long beat)
          So you're saying we can't go in?

          HIGH PRIEST
          I just told you! To enter is
          instant death! Only I can go in
          and only once a year after very
          elaborate purification rituals and
          days of special prayers and
          offerings.

          OH

          (QUICKLY)
          Right, right, right.

          (BEAT)
          What if we just open the doors and
          stick our heads in?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought
          it up. Let's go.
          (pushes Oh along)
          Move. Move.
          He shoos him down the hall.

          Zed and Princess Inanna stealthily enter the temple.

          ZED
          (looking around nervously)
          What are we doing here?

          INANNA
          I want you to enter the Holy of
          Holies.

          ZED
          Yes! Finally. Now you're talking!
          Should I enter it right here or
          should we go back to your bedroom?
          Does the Holy of Holies like to be
          entered from behind or--?

          INANNA

          (POINTS)
          That's the Holy of Holies-- you
          have to go in there and talk to the
          Gods.

          ZED
          The Gods are in there?

          INANNA
          So they say, but the only one who
          ever goes in is the High Priest.
          They say it's instant death for
          anyone else to enter.

          ZED
          Then why am I going in?

          INANNA

          (IMPATIENT)
          Because you were chosen? If the
          Gods wanted you dead they would
          have killed you already.

          ZED

          RIGHT--

          INANNA
          This is what you've been chosen
          for! To speak to the Gods and
          plead with them not to destroy the
          city. Then come back out and tell
          me what it's like inside.

          ZED
          (mulling it over)
          Right-- right. Then again, if the
          rules say--

          INANNA
          Do you always follow the rules?

          ZED
          What is it with chicks always
          wanting guys to break the rules?
          You-all have this bad boy complex----
          She kisses him fiercely on the lips.

          INANNA
          Do this for me.

          ZED
          I'm going in.
          He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the
          columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight
          reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.

          CUT TO:

          58                                                              INT. HOLY OF HOLIES   - CONTINUOUS   58

          Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates
          himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in
          supplication. He lies there with his eyes tightly shut,
          expecting to be vaporized any second. A long moment passes
          in total silence. Then he opens his eyes and looks around
          tentatively.
          The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with
          marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights
          above.

          ZED
          (takes a deep breath and
          starts improvising)
          Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for--
          not like-- killing me, and letting
          me receive the, uh, blessing of
          your holy-- godliness.
          He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine
          response. Nothing comes.

          ELBOWS)
          Okay, I don't know the right words--
          so I'm just going to say what I
          have to say-- if that's all right.
          (waits for a response,
          gets none, proceeds)
          I know I haven't always done the
          right thing. Eating the fruit was
          bad, I know that-- and the Cain
          thing-- and I have done somethings
          with women-- I do love the ladies--
          well, you probably know all that
          because you're watching everything--
          (a thought occurs)
          Do you really watch everything?
          That's got to be a little
          disgusting sometimes-- but probably
          pretty hot, too--

          (QUICKLY)
          Not that you would get off on any
          of it-- okay, I'm getting off the
          subject. Anyways, the word is
          you've been considering destroying
          this place. So I'm asking you not
          to-- as a personal favor.

          (NOTHING)
          Feel free to jump in anytime. I
          could use a little guidance here.
          Still no response. He rolls over onto his back.
          ZED                                               (cont'd)
          Look, I know you think this place
          is evil and it kinda is-- I see
          that-- but that's not everybody.
          There are a lot of good people,
          too. So what if there were, like,
          fifty really good people? Would
          you still destroy the city?

          (SILENCE)
          Okay, you're right, that may be a
          reach. How about twenty? I could
          probably get you twenty extremely
          good people if I really looked
          around.

          (SILENCE)
          How about five? Five awesome
          people-- including myself. I
          personally know at least five
          people worth saving. Does that
          sound good?

          Zed listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a
          revelation. He sits up on the floor.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The
          silence? Is that it?
          (waits for confirmation)
          It is, isn't it! Just this really
          silent-- silence.

          (PONDERING)
          You're not going to tell me what to
          do; it's up to me to decide what's
          right and what's wrong-- right? Is
          that it? You're not going to speak
          to me-- you're going to speak
          through me? If that's right, don't
          say anything.
          (listens for a beat)
          Okay, I read you loud and clear.
          Thank you.
          (an afterthought)
          Oh, and if things don't work out
          with Maya would it be okay with you
          if me and the Princess had a little
          "carnal knowledge"? Not in an evil
          way or anything--
          (he listens; silence)
          Okay! You're right, probably not a
          good idea. Thank you.

          The doors to the Holy of Holies opens and Zed comes backing
          out, still bowing and muttering. Then he turns and his face
          falls.

          The High Priest, the King, the Queen, and a dozen Temple
          Acolytes are staring at him in amazement. Oh stands beside
          the High Priest dressed just like him.

          In the dim torchlight, we see Zed hanging spread-eagle five
          feet off the ground, his arms and legs stretched out wide and
          tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in the stone.
          Oh is shackled to the wall beside him, hanging upside down.

          OH
          What have you done for me? I've
          been attacked by a cougar, I've
          fallen down a mountain, I almost
          had the tip of my thingy cut off,
          I've been greasing up the High
          Priest all night, and now I'm
          hanging upside down in a dungeon.
          And I have to pee real bad. All
          because of you. You call yourself
          a friend? Name one good thing
          you've done for me.

          ZED
          I've helped you come out of your

          I really have to pee--

          Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and
          I may have made a few wrong turns,
          but you have to understand-- I'm a

          Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach,
          over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his
          face.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          I hate you.

          A curious, jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh, in
          shackles, are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform
          in the middle of the square.
          The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain
          presides over the execution. He addresses the crowd.

          CAIN
          For the crimes of blasphemy--
          (the crowd grumbles its

          DISAPPROVAL)

          HERESY--
          (grumble, grumble)

          CONSPIRACY--
          (serious grumbling)

          SODOMY--
          (admiring oohs and aahs)
          And the murder of my brother Abel--

          ZED
          Oh, come on!

          CAIN
          Shut up! For these and other
          crimes they may not actually have
          done yet but we're pretty sure they
          were thinking about, the prisoners
          will be stoned to death.
          The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull
          canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to
          grab stones to throw.
          Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.

          PALACE BALCONY
          The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the
          stoning from their vantage point above the square. Princess
          Inanna refuses to look.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             102.

          KING
          Observe, my dear. It seems the
          least you could do, since it was
          you who lured him to his death.
          She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed.

          INANNA
          I didn't intend for this to happen.

          THE SQUARE
          The people move in and surround the platform on all sides,
          baseball-size rocks in their hands.

          CAIN
          (to Zed and Oh)
          Anything to say before the sentence
          is carried out?

          ZED
          (to the crowd)
          I just want to say this is really
          messed up--

          CAIN

          OKAY--

          (SHOUTS)

          STONE THEM!
          The people fling their rocks with all their might.
          Zed and Oh duck.
          The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on
          the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in
          the head, some falling down unconscious.
          Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks
          from all directions.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This
          isn't working.

          ZED
          Can I make a suggestion?

          CAIN

          (IRKED)
          What?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             103.

          ZED
          Why don't you just pick one person
          to throw?
          The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (pressing the advantage)
          In fact, don't you think it would
          be fair for us to get to pick the
          person who stones us?
          Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently
          fair.

          CROWD
          (some eagerly raising
          their hands and waving
          like school children)
          Yes! Ooh, me! Pick me! Me!

          ON THE BALCONY
          The King grabs Sargon.

          KING
          (re Cain)
          What is that idiot doing?

          IN THE SQUARE
          Zed spots a good candidate in the crowd.

          ZED
          We pick him!
          Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his
          hand.

          CAIN
          Him?

          ZED
          No, next to him!
          He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big.

          CAIN
          He's just a kid!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             104.

          ZED
          So? You got something against
          kids?
          Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          This guy hates kids!

          CROWD
          Yeah! What's he got against kids?
          Children are the future! Give the
          kid a shot! The kid! The kid!
          On the balcony, the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by
          the power of the mob. He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain.

          CAIN
          All right! All right! We'll try
          it. Kid! Grab a rock.
          The boy picks up a good-size rock.
          Zed turns to Oh.

          ZED
          Good thinking, huh?
          They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws.
          The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that
          smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Holy shit! That kid's got an arm!

          OH

          (DAZED)
          I think he hit me.
          The boy fires again.
          Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the
          head.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          Hey! There's two of us!
          The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back.

          CAIN
          Okay, everybody on this side now!
          On the count of three! One-- two--

          ZED
          Wait! I have a question for the
          King!
          The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the
          palace balcony.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          (shouts to the King)
          Why didn't I die in the Holy of
          Holies?
          On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question.
          One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be
          stumped.
          In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the
          initiative.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          I entered the Holy of Holies and,
          lo, I did not die! Why? Because I
          am chosen by the Gods!

          PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
          He is chosen! He is the Chosen
          One. The Chosen One!
          Zed gives Oh a look: "See? I told you."

          THE CROWD
          (starts chanting)
          Spare the Chosen One! Spare the
          Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One!

          OH
          And his friend! Don't forget his
          friend!
          On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer
          with the High Priest.

          KING
          Could it be? Is he truly chosen?

          HIGH PRIEST
          I don't-- I suppose it's possible-
          I'd have to examine some new

          INTESTINES--

          KING
          Imbecile!

          PRIME MINISTER
          Majesty, with respect, whether he's
          chosen or not is no longer the
          issue. To kill him now, given the
          public mood, could inflame the
          situation enough to prompt a
          radical "regime change," if you
          take my meaning.
          The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean
          and hungry looks.
          Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him.

          SARGON
          By order of the King, the sentence
          has been commuted.
          The crowd cheers. Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks.

          CAIN

          (PLAINTIVE)
          Can't we just stone them a little?

          SARGON
          It is the judgement of our most
          merciful King that the prisoners
          are to be enslaved to toil at hard
          labor until they die of exhaustion
          or starvation.

          Oh is up to his knees in a mud pit, trampling straw into the
          thick mud. A Guard cracks a bullwhip which flicks painfully
          across his shoulders.

          OH
          Okay, you think that actually makes
          anybody work harder? It just makes
          them resent you. Is that what you
          want?

          GUARD
          (whips him again)
          Faster!

          OH
          Can I just ask when lunch is?
          The whip lashes out again.
          Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace.

          Marlak and Enmebaragesi are stacking bricks when zed
          approaches.

          ZED
          (greets them)
          Hey! Boys! Long time no see.
          They glance up, but ignore him.

          Don't tell me you're still mad
          about Maya. That's so over. I
          have a thing going with the
          princess now-- well, almost had a
          thing. I'm a slave now-- just like
          you.

          MARLAK
          No. You're not just like me.

          ZED
          Okay. We do have our differences--
          like about a cup and half of brain
          tissue-- but that doesn't mean we
          can't work together.
          Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.

          GUARD #2
          Take those bricks to the top. The
          masons are waiting.

          Marlak and Enmebaragesi glower at the guard as they pick up
          ropes and harness themselves to a cart loaded with bricks.
          GUARD #2                                                      (cont'd)

          You! Help them!
          He grabs another rope harness off the cart and throws it to
          Zed.

          ZED
          You know, I'd like to, but I did
          something to my neck--
          (massages his neck)
          I must've slept on it funny-- those
          dungeon pillows are like rocks--
          well, they are rocks-- so I should
          probably take it easy or I'll be no
          damn good for work tomorrow.

          GUARD #2
          (strikes him across the
          back with his stick)
          I said move!

          ZED
          Okay! But I should tell you, this
          isn't really my area. I'm just on
          a break from the mud department--
          The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed.

          GUARD #2
          One more word and you die--

          ZED
          (putting on the harness)
          Okay, okay. I'm going.
          (to Marlak and

          ENMEBARAGESI)
          Okay, boys, on the count of three.
          One-- two-- three!
          Marlak and Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed
          makes no effort to pull. They glare at him.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)

          Zed, Marlak and Enmebaragesi haul the heavy cart of bricks to
          the very top of the tower.
          TWO BRICKLAYERS are working on the wall. Zed leans against
          the wall next to them tb rest.

          ZED
          How high you guys think we're going
          with this?

          BRICKLAYER ONE
          Up to Heaven, I guess. That's how
          tall they usually build 'em.

          ZED
          (looking up)
          That's ambitious.

          BRICKLAYER TWO
          We worked on the Tower of Babel.
          Now that was a ziggurat.

          Incredible erection.
          Zed looks down at his crotch.

          ZED

          (MODESTLY)
          That's nothing. You should see it
          when I'm excited.

          The tower.

          ZED
          Oh, right, the tower. Incredible
          erection.
          (snickers to himself)

          BRICKLAYER ONE
          See, the Egyptians are working on
          an entirely different concept.
          Four sides, slanting walls, pointy
          top.

          Wow. Far out. Yet timeless in a

          A SLAVE CHILD approaches with a water bucket.

          SLAVE CHILD

          Want some water?
          As the child offers him the ladle, Zed recognizes her.

          ZED
          You're from the village, aren't
          you?
          The child nods.
          ZED                                                         (cont'd)
          I bet you wish you were back there
          right now, don't you.
          The child nods again.
          ZED                                                         (cont'd)
          Well, don't give up. You're going
          to get home someday.
          Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.

          MARLAK
          (standing over him)
          Who's going to take her there? The
          Chosen One?
          Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face. Zed just lies
          there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone.
          Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares
          coming from the temple square below.

          OH
          Is that compulsory? Because I saw
          one when I first got here and it
          made me a little sick--
          The guard's whip catches him across the back.

          The square is filling up with people. The ROYAL PROCESSION
          is moving to the seats of honor to watch the sacrifice.
          Cain is now among the Royal Guard having been promoted for
          his treachery. He bows and helps the Queen to her seat.

          CAIN
          (leering seductively)
          At your service, my lady. Anytime,
          anywhere.

          QUEEN

          (FLIRTATIOUS)
          There's a depraved thought. You're
          so delightfully low. Absolute
          filth.

          CAIN

          (SUAVELY)
          Thank you, your majesty.
          He touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his
          eyebrows.
          The King arrives with Sargon to loud booing from the crowd.

          Are they booing me? How dare they!

          CAIN
          Your Highness, with all due
          respect, those were "Woos." They
          love you. They were "wooing" you.
          The King looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd.

          SARGON
          All is in readiness, Majesty.

          INANNA
          (glares at the King)
          What now? More virgins to
          sacrifice?

          KING
          Yes, two, followers of the Chosen
          One, discovered by this loyal
          soldier.
          Cain bows to the King.

          CAIN
          Just doing my duty.

          KING
          And one more to demonstrate our own
          faith and charity.
          The King stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for
          everyone to hear.
          KING                                                       (cont'd)
          In supplication to the Gods, for
          the love of the People, we offer a
          humble sacrifice to the sacred
          temple fire-- our own step-

          The crowd gasps.

          KING
          Wouldn't I? If you like, I could
          arrange for you to join her.
          The Queen slowly sits back down.

          your insolence?
          (to Sargon)
          Burn her.-
          Sargon and Cain seize Inanna, but she shrugs them off and
          rises with dignity.

          Oh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier, watched by a
          squad of guards, waiting for the ceremony to start.
          THE TEMPLE DOORS open slowly, and the High Priest appears
          holding a long jewelled staff.
          Oh turns to the EDOMITE SLAVE next to him.

          OH
          (casually name-dropping)
          See the High Priest? I know him.
          Dear friend of mine.

          THE TEMPLE
          Now the procession of SACRIFICIAL VIRGINS is led out by the
          HIGH PRIESTESS. Maya and Eema are among them, their hands
          tied. They look like they've been drugged.
          Oh spots Eema and Maya among the virgins.

          EDOMITE SLAVE

          I guess you know everybody, don't
          you.
          Oh shoulders his way right up to the barrier where a BIG
          GUARD stops him with a spear to his neck.

          BIG GUARD
          That's far enough, slave.
          Oh stops right there, frustrated and frightened.

          Inanna is led out last, now also having been drugged.

          The drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the High Priest
          starts leading the virgins to the idol's fiery mouth.

          All right.
          Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses
          him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way
          down.

          ZED
          Wow. Who saw that coming?
          Thanks, Marlak.

          MARLAK
          Now what?
          Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope
          attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end.

          ZED
          (looping the rope around
          his waist)
          Lower me down.
          Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top
          of the ziggurat holding the rope.

          Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and
          sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding.

          CUT TO:

          ZED
          He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the
          ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and
          slow him down.

          ZED

          (CALLING)
          Any time now, Marlak!
          Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his descent, dumbly interested
          in what happens next.
          Zed sees he's not slowing down and tries to swing himself
          onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat. However, when
          he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces
          off painfully.

          THE BRICK CART
          The sudden jolt dislodges the wheel chock that was holding
          the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower. The cart starts
          to roll down the ramp, gathering speed as it careens toward
          the edge.

          Zed is still descending as the broken scaffolding starts to
          give way.

          TEMPLE SQUARE
          The whole crowd watches in amazement as the 250                 foot
          scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground,
          bringing tons of debris with it, sending up a great cloud of
          dust.

          THE HIGH PRIEST
          He looks shocked.

          OH
          He seizes the opportunity.

          A sign! It's a sign! The Chosen
          One comes!
          The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his

          the crowd.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Yes! Well and truly, the Gods are

          A guard is standing there staring at the rubble of the
          scaffolding as Zed comes screaming down the side of the
          ziggurat and lands right on top of him. Zed quickly strips
          the unconscious guard of his weapons, starts to run off,
          stops, comes back and grabs the guard's helmet, then takes
          off running to the temple square.

          The High Priest is getting frantic now.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Burn them! Now!
          He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth
          of the idol and the raging fire within. She struggles but is
          too drugged to put up much resistance. He grabs the
          sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                     (cont'd)

          She sees him and starts to revive.

          MAYA
          Zed!

          THE HIGH PRIEST
          looks up, unable to hear Zed over the crowd noise.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (cupping his ear)
          What did you say?

          ZED

          (SHOUTS)
          I said, 'I don't think so!'

          HIGH PRIEST
          (shakes his head)
          Still not getting it.
          Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively
          climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last
          few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the
          High Priest's way.

          ZED
          I Said, 'I don't think so.'

          (THINKS)
          I forgot.

          (SHOUTS)
          Guards!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                            120.
          Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a
          demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows
          with his shield.
          Oh is inspired by Zed's courage.

          OH
          (to the Edomite slave)
          I know him, too.
          Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of
          him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their
          guards, a genuine slave revolt.

          THE CROWD
          Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of
          insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start
          grappling with the guards.
          A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS comes double-timing into the
          square.
          Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws off his cloak and pulls a
          sword. It's Abraham!

          ABRAHAM
          Death to the idolators!
          Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their
          weapons and attack the reinforcements.
          The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there
          observing the growing chaos.

          ISAAC
          (shaking his head)
          Just fucking nuts.

          77                                                              MARLAK AND ENMEBARAGESI   77
          They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly
          bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike.
          Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground.

          CAIN
          Tough guy, huh? You want a piece
          of me? Get ready to have your head
          bashed in!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                               121.
          As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          (nose bleeding, stunned)
          Nice move!
          He passes out and goes down.

          78                                                              THE KING     78
          He starts to panic at the full-scale revolt and rises
          nervously. His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect
          him.

          KING
          I knew I could depend on your
          loyalty.
          The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in
          for the kill.
          KING                                                            (cont'd)

          (MUTTERS)
          Assholes.
          He falls to their flashing knives.

          79                                                              THE TEMPLE   79
          Oh fights his way to the temple stairs, runs up and confronts
          a PRIEST who is trying to drag Eema away. He fights with
          very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming
          the guard and grabbing Eema.

          OH
          (suddenly shy again)
          Hello, Eema.

          EEMA
          (still a little dazed)
          Oh?
          He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes.

          OH
          (suddenly forceful)
          Eema, you're my woman! You hear
          me?

          EEMA
          Okay.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                    122.

          OH
          Really? It's okay?
          He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the
          mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard
          rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform,
          accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.

          80                                                              THE HIGH PRIEST   80
          While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya
          toward the fire.
          Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts
          slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away
          until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He
          holds the helpless Maya close to the flames.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (screaming and crying)
          Keep away!

          ZED
          Let her go.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (his mascara running)
          No! The Gods demand a sacrifice!
          And you ruined it!
          He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.

          ZED
          (trying to keep him calm)
          Why don't we just sacrifice
          something small-- a rabbit maybe.
          Or a duck. That'd be good, don't
          you think?

          HIGH PRIEST

          (SCREAMS)
          No! A duck would not be good!

          OH                                                              (U.S.)
          Then how about this?
          The High Priest turns to Oh.
          Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          More oil?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             123.
          He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him
          from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed
          dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp.
          The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap
          around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform
          shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's
          fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame
          like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the
          mouth of the furnace.

          HIGH PRIEST

          (SCREAMS)
          Hot!

          TEMPLE SQUARE
          Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of
          events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before
          them on the center stage of the temple.

          ZED AND OH
          They look at each other. Someone has to say something.
          Finally, Zed clears his throat.

          ZED
          I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess,
          and on behalf of, well, the whole
          city, I want to thank the High
          Priest for his incredible
          sacrifice. That was really
          something, wasn't it?
          He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the
          people in the square are applauding.
          At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in
          the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady
          rain starts to fall.
          The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they
          all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as
          it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied
          muttering begins.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (jumping in quickly)
          People! Friends! Sodomites!
          Okay, that was a little confusing,
          wasn't it?

                                                                        Official White              124.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Was that a sign from God? Wasn't
          it a sign? What's the deal? We
          all want to know. But I'm not sure
          anybody really knows-- and I'd be
          real suspicious of people who say
          they do. If I've learned one
          thing, it's this: the world and
          everything in it is a miracle. And
          what that miracle means is for each
          and every one of us to figure out
          for himself. Are the Gods going to
          destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know--
          I guess it's possible. But if we
          keep going the way we are, they
          won't have to. We're doing a
          pretty good job of destroying
          ourselves. So maybe we should all
          just go home now, and think about
          what happened-- and be very, very
          good to each other. I know I'm
          going to try.
          (raises his hand in salute
          to the people)
          Peace.
          The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make
          of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear.

          MARLAK
          All hail the Chosen One!
          With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers.
          In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls.

          ABRAHAM
          What am I? Chopped liver?
          At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.

          MAYA
          You're incredible, you know that?

          ZED
          That's what I've been trying to
          tell you.
          Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the
          gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          A caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city.
          Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are
          there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews.
          Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts.

          ISAAC
          Hey, babe. Ever made it with a
          circumcised guy?
          Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)

          (BACKPEDALING)
          Is she with you? I did not realize
          that. Sorry.
          Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse.
          Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard
          on the shoulder.

          MARLAK

          (GRUDGING)
          You did good.
          Zed waits for more, but nothing comes.

          ZED
          (rubbing his shoulder)
          Well said, Marlak. You really have
          a way with words.
          They clasp hands.

          MARLAK
          We'll tell stories about you around
          the fire.

          ZED
          Not much to tell, is there? Just
          an average guy who saw his destiny
          and had the courage to defy a
          powerful empire. No big deal.
          Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one
          is listening to him. Zed joins him.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Everybody ready?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                          126.

          OH

          (WORRIED)
          Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The
          Hebrews are going to lead us to the
          sea and we can get boats from
          there. We can trade all this stuff
          everybody gave us for the trip
          home.

          (NERVOUS)
          I don't think I should be the
          leader. Nobody's listening to me.

          EEMA
          (by his side)
          I'll listen to you.
          Oh swells up with pride.

          OH
          (turns to Zed)
          Come back to the village sometime.
          Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a
          tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel.
          OH                                                           (cont'd)
          (shouting at camel)
          Hee-ya!
          (beat, quietly to camel)
          Come on. People are watching.
          The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off.
          Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow.
          As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there
          with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground
          beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet.
          Maya joins him.

          MAYA
          Where will you go now?

          ZED
          Might head down to Egypt. I hear
          it's a happening kinda place.

          MAYA
          Are you going alone?

          ZED
          Not necessarily. You want to come?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             127.

          MAYA
          I'll get my things.
          She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and
          horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions.
          MAYA (cont'd)
          The Princess gave me a few gifts
          when she freed us.

          ZED
          Traveling light, huh? Okay, here
          we go.

          (POINTS)
          To the west!

          MAYA
          (correcting him)
          That's west.

          ZED
          I knew that. Just wanted to see if
          you did.
          Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of
          sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the
          opposite direction.
          As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something
          masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to
          her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.

          CAIN
          (in a high unconvincing
          woman's voice)
          Peace--- brother.
          zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off
          with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall.


                                      THE END
